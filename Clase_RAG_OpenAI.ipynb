Besides the usual wisdom and good decision making to guide the project, he was the driving force behind adding all the new apps to the DVD/web. As always, Brett has been a pleasure to work with, and an impor-tant part of deciding what the entire Official Cert Guide series direction should be.\\nAs part of writing these books, we work in concert with Cisco. A special thanks goes out \\nto various people on the Cisco team who work with Pearson to create Cisco Press books. In particular, Greg Cote, Joe Stralo, and Phil Vancil were a great help while we worked on these titles.\\nDrew Cupp did his usual wonderful job with this book as development editor. He took \\nover the job for this book during a pretty high-stress and high-load timeframe, and deliv-ered with excellence. Thanks Drew for jumping in and getting into the minutia while keeping the big-picture features on track. And thanks for the work on the online/DVD elements as well!\\nAubrey Adams and Elan Beer both did a great job as technical editors for this book, just \\nas they did for the ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide. This book presented a little more of a challenge, from the breadth of some of the new topics, just keeping focus with such a long pair of books in a short time frame. Many thanks to Aubrey and Elan, for the timely input, for taking the time to read and think about every new part of the book, for finding those small technical areas, and for telling me where I need to do more. Truly, it’s a much better book because of the two of you.\\nHank Preston of Cisco Systems, IT as a Service Architect, and co-author of the Cisco \\nPress CCNA Cloud CLDADM 210-455 Cert Guide, gave me some valuable assistance \\nwhen researching before writing the cloud computing chapter (27). Hank helped me refine my understanding based on his great experience with helping Cisco customers implement cloud computing. Hank did not write the chapter, but his insights definitely made the chapter much better and more realistic. \\nWelcome and thanks to Lisa Matthews for her work on the DVD and online tools, like \\nthe Key Topics reviews. That work included many new math-related apps in the ICND1 book, but also many new features that sit on the DVD and on this book’s website as review tools. Thanks for the hard work, Lisa!\\nI love the magic wand that is production. Presto, Word docs with gobs of queries and \\ncomments feed into the machine, and out pops these beautiful books. Thanks to Sandra Schroeder, Tonya Simpson, and all the production team for making the magic happen. From fixing all my grammar, crummy word choices, and passive-voice sentences to pull-ing the design and layout together, they do it all; thanks for putting it all together and making it look easy. And Tonya, once again getting the “opportunity” to manage two books with many elements at the same timeline. Once again, the juggling act continues, and once again, it is done well and beautifully. Thanks for managing the whole produc-tion process again.vii\\nptg17396363viii  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe figures in the book continue to be an important part of the book, by design, with a \\ngreat deal of attention paid to choosing how to use figures to communicate ideas. Mike Tanamachi, illustrator and mind reader, did his usual great job creating the finished fig-ure files once again. Thanks for the usual fine work, Mike!\\nI could not have made the timeline for this book without Chris Burns of Certskills \\nProfessional. Chris owns the mind map process now, owns big parts of the lab develop-ment process for the associated labs added to my blogs, does various tasks related to specific chapters, and then catches anything I need to toss over my shoulder so I can focus on the books. Chris, you are the man!\\nSean Wilkins played the largest role he’s played so far with one of my books. A long-\\ntime co-collaborator with Pearson’s CCNA Simulator, Sean did a lot of technology work behind the scenes. No way the books are out on time without Sean’s efforts; thanks for the great job, Sean!\\nA special thanks to you readers who submit suggestions and point out possible errors, \\nand especially to those of you who post online at the Cisco Learning Network. Without question, past comments I have received directly and “overheard” by participating at CLN have made this edition a better book. \\nThanks to my wonderful wife, Kris, who helps make this sometimes challenging work \\nlifestyle a breeze. I love walking this journey with you, doll. Thanks to my daughter Hannah. And thanks to Jesus Christ, Lord of everything in my life.\\nptg17396363ix\\nContents at a Glance\\nIntroduction xxxv\\nYour Study Plan 2\\nPart I Ethernet LANs 13\\nChapter 1 Implementing Ethernet

If you’re reading far enough to look at this book’s Introduction, you’ve \\nprobably already decided to go for your Cisco certification. If you want to succeed as a technical person in the networking industry at all, you need to know Cisco. Cisco has a ridiculously high market share in the router and switch marketplace, with more than 80 percent market share in some markets. In many geographies and markets around the world, networking equals Cisco. If you want to be taken seriously as a network engineer, Cisco cer-tification makes perfect sense.\\nThe Exams to Achieve CCENT and CCNA R&S\\nCisco announced changes to the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching certifications, and the related 100-105 ICND1, 200-105 ICND2, and 200-125 CCNA exams, early in the year 2016. Most everyone new to Cisco certifications begins with either CCENT or CCNA Routing and Switching (CCNA R&S). However, the paths to certification are not quite obvi-ous at first.\\nThe CCENT certification requires a single step: pass the ICND1 exam. Simple enough.Cisco gives you two options to achieve CCNA R&S certification, as shown in Figure I-1: \\npass both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, or just pass the CCNA exam. Both paths cover the same exam topics, but the two-exam path does so spread over two exams rather than one. You also pick up the CCENT certification by going through the two-exam path, but you do not when working through the single-exam (200-125) option.\\n100-105\\nICND1200-105\\nICND2\\n200-125 CCNACCENT\\nCCNA\\nRouting and Switching\\n(CCNA R&S)\\nFigure I-1 Cisco Entry-Level Certifications and Exams\\nNote that Cisco has begun referencing some exams with a version number on some of their websites. If that form holds true, the exams in Figure I-1 will likely be called version 3 (or v3 for short). Historically, the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam is the seventh separate version of the exam (which warrants a different exam number), dating back to 1998. To make sure you reference the correct exam, when looking for information, using forums, and registering for the test, just make sure to use the correct exam number as shown in the figure.\\nptg17396363xxxvi  CCNA INTRO Official Exam Certification Guide\\nTypes of Questions on the Exams\\nThe ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA R&S exams all follow the same general format. At the \\ntesting center, you sit in a quiet room with a PC. Before the exam timer begins, you have a chance to do a few other tasks on the PC; for instance, you can take a sample quiz just to get accustomed to the PC and the testing engine. Anyone who has user-level skills in getting around a PC should have no problems with the testing environment. The question types are\\n■Multiple-choice, single-answer\\n■Multiple-choice, multiple-answer\\n■Testlet (one scenario with several multiple-choice questions)\\n■Drag-and-drop\\n■Simulated lab (sim)\\n■Simlet\\nYou should take the time to learn as much as possible by using the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial, which you can find by going to Cisco.com and searching for “exam tuto-rial.” This tool walks through each type of question Cisco may ask on the exam. \\nAlthough the first four types of questions in the list should be familiar to anyone who has \\ntaken standardized tests or similar tests in school, the last two types are more common to IT tests and Cisco exams in particular. Both use a network simulator to ask questions, so that you control and use simulated Cisco devices. In particular:\\n■Sim questions: You see a network topology, a lab scenario, and can access the devices.Your job is to fix a problem with the configuration.\\n■Simlet questions: This style combines sim and testlet question formats. Like a sim ques-tion, you see a network topology, a lab scenario, and can access the devices. However,like a testlet, you also see several multiple-choice questions. Instead of changing/fixingthe configuration, you answer questions about the current state of the network.\\nUsing these two question styles with the simulator enables Cisco to test your configuration skills with sim questions, and your verification and troubleshooting skills with simlet ques-tions.\\nWhat’s on the CCNA Exams…and in the Book?\\nEver since I was in grade school, whenever the teacher announced that we were having a test soon, someone would always ask, “What’s on the test?” Even in college, people would try to get more information about what would be on the exams. At heart, the goal is to know what to study hard, what to study a little, and what to not study at all.\\nYou can find out more about what’s on the exam from two primary sources: this book and \\nthe Cisco website.\\nThe Cisco Published Exam Topics\\nFirst, Cisco tells the world the specific topics on each of their certification exams. For every Cisco certification exam, Cisco wants the public to know both the variety of topics \\nptg17396363Introduction  xxxvii\\nand what kinds of knowledge and skills are required for each topic. Just go to http://www.\\ncisco.com/go/certifications, look for the CCENT and CCNA Routing and Switching pages, and navigate until you see the exam topics. \\nNote that this book lists those same exam topics in Appendix L, “Exam Topic Cross \\nReference.” This PDF appendix lists two cross references: one with a list of the exam topics in the order in which Cisco lists them on their website; and the other with a list of chapters in this book with the corresponding exam topics included in each chapter.\\nCisco does more than just list the topic (for example, IPv4 addressing); they also list the \\ndepth to which you must master the topic. The primary exam topics each list one or more verbs that describe the skill level required. For example, consider the following exam topic, which describes one of the most important topics in both CCENT and CCNA R&S:\\nConfigure, verify, and troubleshoot IPv4 addressing and subnetting\\nNote that this one exam topic has three verbs (configure, verify, and troubleshoot). So, you should be able to not only configure IPv4 addresses and subnets, but also understand them well enough to verify that the configuration works, and to troubleshoot problems when it is not working. And if to do that you need to understand concepts and need to have other knowledge, those details are implied. The exam questions will attempt to assess whether you can configure, verify, and troubleshoot.\\nThe Cisco exam topics provide the definitive list of topics and skill levels required by Cisco \\nfor the exams. But the list of exam topics provides only a certain level of depth. For exam-ple, the ICND1 100-105 exam topics list has 41 primary exam topics (topics with verbs), plus additional subtopics that provide more details about that technology area. Although very useful, the list of exam topics would take about five pages of this book if laid out in a list.\\nYou should take the time to not only read the exam topics, but read the short material \\nabove the exam topics as listed at the Cisco web page for each certification and exam. Look for notices about the use of unscored items, and how Cisco intends the exam topics to be a set of general guidelines for the exams.\\nThis Book: About the Exam Topics\\nThis book provides a complete study system for the Cisco published exam topics for the ICND2 200-105 exam. All the topics in this book either directly relate to some ICND2 exam topic or provide more basic background knowledge for some exam topic. The scope of the book is defined by the exam topics.\\nFor those of you thinking more specifically about the CCNA R&S certification, and the \\nCCNA 200-125 single-exam path to CCNA, this book covers about one-half of the CCNA exam topics. The CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide (and ICND1 100-105 exam topics) covers about half of the topics listed for the CCNA 200-125 exam, and this book (and the ICND2 200-105 exam topics) covers the other half. In short, for content, CCNA = ICND1 + ICND2. \\nptg17396363xxxviii  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nBook Features\\nThis book (and the related CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide) goes \\nbeyond what you would find in a simple technology book. It gives you a study system designed to help you not only learn facts but also to develop the skills you need to pass the exams. To do that, in the technology chapters of the book, about three-quarters of the chapter is about the technology, and about one-quarter is for the related study features. \\nThe “Foundation Topics” section of each chapter contains rich content to explain the topics \\non the exam and to show many examples. This section makes extensive use of figures, with lists and tables for comparisons. It also highlights the most important topics in each chapter as key topics, so you know what to master first in your study. \\nMost of the book’s features tie in some way to the need to study beyond simply reading \\nthe “Foundation Topics” section of each chapter. The rest of this section explains these book features. And because the book organizes your study by chapter, and then by part (a part contains multiple chapters), and then a final review at the end of the book, the next section of this Introduction discusses the book features introduced by chapter, part, and for final review. \\nChapter Features and How to Use Each Chapter\\nEach chapter of this book is a self-contained short course about one topic area, organized for reading and study as follows:\\n■“Do I Know This Already?” quiz: Each chapter begins with a prechapter quiz.\\n■Foundation Topics: This is the heading for the core content section of the chapter.\\n■Chapter Review: This section includes a list of study tasks useful to help you rememberconcepts, connect ideas, and practice skills-based content in the chapter.\\nFigure I-2 shows how each chapter uses these three key elements. You start with the “Do I Know This Already?” (DIKTA) quiz. You can use the score to determine whether you already know a lot, or not so much, and determine how to approach reading the Foundation Topics (that is, the technology content in the chapter). When finished with the Foundation Topics, use the Chapter Review tasks to start working on mastering your memory of the facts and skills with configuration, verification, and troubleshooting.\\nTake Quiz1) In-Chapter, or...\\n2) Companion Website3) DVDHigh Score(Skim) Foundation Topics\\nLow Score(Read)  Foundation TopicsFoundation Topics Chapter Review DIKTA Quiz\\nFigure I-2 Three Primary Tasks for a First Pass Through Each Chapter\\nIn addition to these three main chapter features, each “Chapter Review” section presents a \\nvariety of other book features, including the following: \\n■Review Key Topics: In the “Foundation Topics” section, the Key Topic icon appearsnext to the most important items, for the purpose of later review and mastery. While all\\nptg17396363Introduction  xxxix\\ncontent matters, some is, of course, more important to learn, or needs more review to \\nmaster, so these items are noted as key topics. The “Review Key Topics” section lists the key topics in a table; scan the chapter for these items to review them.\\n■Complete Tables from Memory: Instead of just rereading an important table of informa-tion, some tables have been marked as memory tables. These tables exist in the MemoryTable app that is available on the DVD and from the companion website. The app showsthe table with some content removed, and then reveals the completed table, so you canwork on memorizing the content.\\n■Key Terms You Should Know: You do not need to be able to write a formal definitionof all terms from scratch. However, you do need to understand each term well enoughto understand exam questions and answers. This section lists the key terminology fromthe chapter. Make sure you have a good understanding of each term, and use the DVDGlossary to cross-check your own mental definitions.\\n■Labs: Many exam topics use the verbs “configure,” “verify,” and “troubleshoot”; all theserefer to skills you should practice at the command-line interface (CLI) of a router orswitch. The Chapter Review refers you to these other tools. The Introduction’s sectiontitled “About Building Hands-On Skills” discusses your options.\\n■Command References: Some book chapters cover a large number of router and switchcommands. This section includes reference tables for the commands used in that chapter,along with an explanation. Use these tables for reference, but also use them for study—just cover one column of the table, and see how much you can remember and completementally.\\n■Review DIKTA Questions: Re-answering the DIKTA questions from the chapter is auseful way to review facts. The Part Review element that comes at the end of each bookPart suggests that you repeat the DIKTA questions. The Part Review also suggests usingthe Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) exam software that comes with thebook, for extra practice in answering multiple-choice questions on a computer.\\nPart Features and How to Use Part Review\\nThe book organizes the chapters into seven parts. Each part contains a number of related chapters. Figure I-3 lists the titles of the parts and identifies the chapters in those parts by chapter numbers.\\nIPv4 Routing Protocols (7-12)IPv4 Services: ACLs\\nand QoS (16-18)IPv4 Routing and\\nTroubleshooting (19-21)4 5\\n1 Ethernet LANs (1-6)2Wide Area Networks (13-15) 3IPv6 (22-25) Miscellaneous (26-28) 6 7\\nFigure I-3 The Book Parts and Corresponding Chapter Numbers\\nptg17396363xl  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nEach book part ends with a “Part Review” section that contains a list of activities for study \\nand review, much like the “Chapter Review” section at the end of each chapter. However, because the Part Review takes place after completing a number of chapters, the Part Review includes some tasks meant to help pull the ideas together from this larger body of work. The following list explains the types of tasks added to each Part Review beyond the types mentioned for the Chapter Review:\\n■Answer Part Review Questions: The books come with exam software and databasesof questions. One database holds questions written specifically for Part Reviews. Thesequestions tend to connect multiple ideas together, to help you think about topics frommultiple chapters, and to build the skills needed for the more challenging analysis ques-tions on the exams.\\n■Mind Maps: Mind maps are graphical organizing tools that many people find usefulwhen learning and processing how concepts fit together. The process of creating mindmaps helps you build mental connections. The Part Review elements make use of mindmaps in several ways: to connect concepts and the related configuration commands, toconnect show commands and the related networking concepts, and even to connect ter-\\nminology. (For more information about mind maps, see the section “About Mind Maps”later in this Introduction.)\\n■Labs: Each “Part Review” section will direct you to the kinds of lab exercises you shoulddo with your chosen lab product, labs that would be more appropriate for this stageof study and review. (Check out the later section “About Building Hands-On Skills” forinformation about lab options.)\\nIn addition to these tasks, many “Part Review” sections have you perform other tasks with book features mentioned in the “Chapter Review” section: repeating DIKTA quiz questions, reviewing key topics, and doing more lab exercises.\\nFinal Review\\nChapter 29, “Final Review,” lists a series of preparation tasks that you can best use for your final preparation before taking the exam. Chapter 29 focuses on a three-part approach to helping you pass: practicing your skills, practicing answering exam questions, and uncover-ing your weak spots. To that end, Chapter 29 uses the same familiar book features discussed for the Chapter Review and Part Review elements, along with a much larger set of practice questions.\\nOther Features\\nIn addition to the features in each of the core chapters, this book, as a whole, has additional study resources, including the following:\\n■DVD-based practice exams: The companion DVD contains the powerful Pearson ITCertification Practice Test (PCPT) exam engine. You can take simulated ICND2 exams,as well as CCNA exams, with the DVD and activation code included in this book. (Youcan take simulated ICND1 and CCNA R&S exams with the DVD in the CCENT/CCNA\\nICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide.)\\nptg17396363Introduction  xli\\n■CCNA ICND2 Simulator Lite: This lite version of the best-selling CCNA Network\\nSimulator from Pearson provides you with a means, right now, to experience the CiscoCLI. No need to go buy real gear or buy a full simulator to start learning the CLI.

Start at http://www.certskills.com; click the Blog tab for a page about the blogs in particular, with links to thepages with the labs related to this book.\\nA Big New Feature: Review Applications\\nOne of the single biggest new features of this edition of the book is the addition of study apps for many of the Chapter Review activities. In the past, all Chapter Review activities used only the book chapter, or the chapter plus a DVD-only appendix. Readers tell us they find that content useful, but the content is static. \\nThis book and the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide are the first Cisco \\nPress Cert Guides with extensive interactive applications. Basically, most every activity that can be done in the “Chapter Review” sections can now be done with an application. The apps can be found both on the DVD that comes with the book and on the book’s \\nptg17396363xlii  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ncompanion website. On the DVD you can find the apps under the “Chapter and Part \\nReview” tab.\\nThe advantages of using these apps are as follows:\\n■Easier to use: Instead of having to print out copies of the appendixes and do the work\\non paper, these new apps provide you with an easy-to-use, interactive experience thatyou can easily run over and over.\\n■Convenient: When you have a spare 5–10 minutes, go to the book’s website, and reviewcontent from one of your recently finished chapters.\\n■Untethered from book/DVD: Because these apps are available on the book’s companionwebsite in addition to the DVD, you can access your review activities from anywhere—no need to have the book or DVD with you.\\n■Good for tactile learners: Sometimes looking at a static page after reading a chapter letsyour mind wander. Tactile learners may do better by at least typing answers into an app,or clicking inside an app to navigate, to help keep you focused on the activity.\\nOur in-depth reader surveys show that readers who use the Chapter Review tools like them, but that not everyone uses them consistently. So, we want to increase the number of people using the review tools, and make them both more useful and more interesting. Table I-1 summarizes these new applications and the traditional book features that cover the same content.\\nTable I-1 Book Features with Both Traditional and App Options\\nFeature Traditional App\\nKey Topics Table w ith list; flip pages to find Key T opics Table app\\nConfig Checklist Just one of many types of key t opics Config Che cklist app\\nMemory Table Two static PDF appendixes (one w ith \\nsparse tables for you to complete, \\none with completed tables)Memory Table app\\nKey Terms Listed in each “Chapter Review” \\nsection, with the Glossary in the back of the bookGlossary Flash Cards app\\nIPv4 ACL Practice A static PDF appendix (D) with practice problemsAn interactive app that asks the same problems as listed in the appendix\\nHow to Get the Electronic Elements of This Book\\nTraditionally, all chapter review activities use the book chapter plus appendixes, with the \\nappendixes often being located on the DVD. But most of that content is static—useful, but static.\\nIf you buy the print book, and have a DVD drive, you have all the content on the DVD. Just \\nspin the DVD and use the disk menu (which should automatically start) to explore all the content.\\nptg17396363Introduction  xliii\\nIf you buy the print book but do not have a DVD drive, you can get the DVD files by regis-\\ntering your book on the Cisco Press website. To do so, simply go to http://www.ciscopress.com/register and enter the ISBN of the print book: 9781587205798.

From \\nthere, click the Access Bonus Content link to get access to the book’s companion website. \\nIf you buy the CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide \\nPremium Edition eBook and Practice Test from Cisco Press, your book will automatically be registered on your account page. Simply go to your account page, click the Registered \\nProducts tab, and select Access Bonus Content to access the book’s companion website.\\nIf you buy the eBook from some other bookseller, the very last page of your eBook file \\nwill contain instructions for how to register the book and access the companion website. The steps are the same as noted earlier for those who buy the print book but do not have a DVD drive.\\nBook Organization, Chapters, and Appendixes\\nThis book contains 28 core chapters, Chapters 1 through 28, with Chapter 29 as the “Final Review” chapter. Each core chapter covers a subset of the topics on the ICND2 exam. The core chapters are organized into sections.

Thischapter explains the basic concepts and then generally discusses the impact that cloudcomputing has on a typical enterprise network.\\n■Chapter 28, “SDN and Network Programmability,” is the other chapter that movesaway from traditional CCNA R&S topics to discuss many concepts and terms related tohow Software Defined Networking (SDN) and network programmability are impactingtypical enterprise networks.\\nPart VIII: Final Prep\\n■Chapter 29, “Final Review,” suggests a plan for final preparation once you have finishedthe core parts of the book, in particular explaining the many study options available inthe book.\\nPart IX: Appendixes (In Print)\\n■Appendix A, “Numeric Reference Tables,” lists several tables of numeric information,including a binary-to-decimal conversion table and a list of powers of 2.\\n■Appendix B, “CCNA ICND2 200-105 Exam Updates,” is a place for the author to addbook content mid-edition. Always check online for the latest PDF version of this appen-dix; the appendix lists download instructions.\\n■The Glossary contains definitions for all of the terms listed in the “Key Terms You\\nShould Know” sections at the conclusion of Chapters 1 through 28.\\nptg17396363xlvi  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPart X: DVD Appendixes \\nThe following appendixes are available in digital format on the DVD that accompanies this \\nbook:\\n■Appendix C, “Answers to the ‘Do I Know This Already?’ Quizzes,” includes the expla-nations to all the questions from Chapters 1 through 28.\\n■Appendix D, “Practice for Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists,” is a copy ofthe CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide’s Appendix I.\\n■Appendix E, “Mind Map Solutions,” shows an image of sample answers for all the part-ending mind map exercises.\\n■Appendix F, “Study Planner,” is a spreadsheet with major study milestones, where youcan track your progress through your study.\\n■Appendix G, “Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2,” explains how routers work togetherto find all the best routes to each subnet using a routing protocol. This chapter alsoshows how to configure the RIPv2 routing protocol for use with IPv4. (This appendix is acopy of ICND1’s Chapter 19, and is included with the ICND2 book for convenience.)\\n■Appendix H, “Understanding Frame Relay Concepts,” explains how to build a FrameRelay WAN between routers, focusing on the protocols and concepts rather than theconfiguration. (This chapter is a chapter that covers old exam topics from the previousedition of the book, included here for those who might be interested.)\\n■Appendix I, “Implementing Frame Relay,” takes the concepts discussed in Appendix Hand shows how to configure, verify, and troubleshoot those same features. (This chapteris a chapter that covers old exam topics from the previous edition of the book, includedhere for those who might be interested.)\\n■Appendix J, “IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools,” focuses on how to use two key trouble-shooting tools to find routing problems: the ping and traceroute commands. (Thisappendix is a copy of ICND1’s Chapter 23, and is included with the ICND2 book forconvenience.)\\n■Appendix K, “Topics from Previous Editions,” is a collection of information about top-ics that have appeared on previous versions of the CCNA exams. While you most likelywill not encounter exam questions on these topics, the concepts are still of interest tosomeone with the CCENT or CCNA certification.\\n■Appendix L, “Exam Topic Cross Reference,” provides some tables to help you findwhere each exam objective is covered in the book.\\nICND1 Chapters in this Book\\nFor this current edition of the ICND1 and ICND2 Cert Guides, I designed several chapters to be used in both books. These chapters include some topics that are listed in the exam topics of both exams:\\n■Chapter 1, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs” (Chapter 11 in the ICND1 100-101\\nbook).\\n■Chapter 16, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists” (Chapter 25 in the ICND1 100-101 book).\\nptg17396363Introduction  xlvii\\n■Chapter 17, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists” (Chapter 26 in the ICND1 100-101\\nbook).\\n■Chapter 21, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing” (Chapter 24 in the ICND1 100-101 book).\\nI designed these four chapters for use in both books to be a help to those reading both \\nbooks while avoiding any problems for those who might be reading only this ICND2 Cert Guide. Cisco has traditionally had some topics that overlap between the two exams that make up the two-exam path to CCNA R&S, and this current pair of exams is no exception. So, for those of you who have already read the ICND1 100-101 book, you can move more quickly through the above four chapters in this book. If you did not read the ICND1 100-101 book, then you have all the material you need right here in this book.\\nExtra Content Found in DVD Appendixes\\nNote that several appendixes on the DVD, namely G, H, I, J, and K, contain extra content outside the ICND2 200-105 exam topics. This short section explains why. \\nFirst, two appendixes are here to aid the transition when Cisco announced the exams. \\nAppendixes G (about RIP) and J (about ping and traceroute) are copies of two chapters in the ICND1 100-105 book, and are part of the exam topics for the ICND1 100-105 exam. These two chapters might be particularly useful for anyone who was far along in their stud-ies on the date when Cisco announced the ICND1 100-105 and ICND2 200-105 exams in 2016. I included Appendixes G and J to aid that transition for those who buy the ICND2 200-105 Cert Guide but not the ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide.\\nThree other appendixes are included for instructors who use these books for classes, as well \\nas for the occasional reader who is mostly interested in the technology instead of the certi-fication. Appendixes H, I, and K contain content that is no longer mentioned by the exam topics for the current exams. Appendixes H and I are copies of complete chapters about Frame Relay from the prior edition of this book, and Appendix K is a compilation of small topics I removed from the prior edition of this book when creating this current edition. This material might be helpful to some instructors during the transition time for their courses, or for those who want to read more broadly just for the sake of learning. \\nYou do not need to use these extra appendixes (G through K) to prepare for the ICND2 \\n200-105 exam or the CCNA R&S 200-125 exam, but feel free to use them if you are inter-ested.\\nReference Information\\nThis short section contains a few topics available for reference elsewhere in the book. You may read these when you first use the book, but you may also skip these topics and refer back to them later. In particular, make sure to note the final page of this introduction, which lists several contact details, including how to get in touch with Cisco Press.\\nInstall the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test Engine and Questions\\nThis book, like many other Cisco Press books, includes the rights to use the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) software, along with rights to use some exam questions related to this book. PCPT has many options, including the option to answer questions \\nptg17396363xlviii  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nin study mode, so you can see the answers and explanations for each question as you go \\nalong; the option to take a simulated exam that mimics real exam conditions; and the option to view questions in flash card mode, where all the answers are stripped out, challenging you to answer questions from memory.\\nYou should install PCPT so it is ready to use even for the earliest chapters. This book’s Part \\nReview sections ask you specifically to use PCPT, and you can even take the DIKTA chap-ter quizzes using PCPT.\\nNOTE The right to use the exams associated with this book is based on an activation code. \\nFor those with a paper book, the code is in the DVD sleeve at the back of the book. (Flip over the paper with the exam activation code to find a one-time-use coupon code for 70 percent off the purchase of the CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide, Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test.) For those who purchase the Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test directly from the Cisco Press website, the activa-tion code will be populated on your account page after purchase. For those who purchase a Kindle edition, the access code will be supplied directly from Amazon. Note that if you purchase an eBook version from any other source, the practice test is not included, as other vendors are not able to vend the required unique access code. Do not lose the activation code.\\nPCPT Exam Databases with This Book\\nThis book includes an activation code that allows you to load a set of practice questions. \\nThe questions come in different exams or exam databases. When you install the PCPT soft-ware and type in the activation code, the PCPT software downloads the latest version of all these exam databases. And with the ICND2 book alone, you get six different “exams,” or six different sets of questions, as listed in Figure I-4.\\nICND2 Exam #1\\nICND2 Exam #2DIKTA (“Book”)\\nPart ReviewCCNA Exam #1\\nCCNA Exam #2\\nFigure I-4 PCPT Exams/Exam Databases and When to Use Them\\nYou can choose to use any of these exam databases at any time, both in study mode and practice exam mode. However, many people find it best to save some of the exams until exam review time, after you have finished reading the entire book. Figure I-4 begins to sug-gest a plan, spelled out here:\\n■During Part Review, use PCPT to review the DIKTA questions for that part, using study\\nmode.\\n■During Part Review, use the questions built specifically for Part Review (the Part Review\\nquestions) for that part of the book, using study mode.\\n■Save the remaining exams to use with the “Final Review” chapter at the end of the book;\\nif preparing for the ICND2 exam, use those practice exams, but if preparing for theCCNA exam, use those exams.\\nptg17396363Introduction  xlix\\nThe two modes inside PCPT give you better options for study versus practicing a timed \\nexam event. In study mode, you can see the answers immediately, so you can study the topics more easily. Also, you can choose a subset of the questions in an exam database; for instance, you can view questions from only the chapters in one part of the book.\\nPCPT practice mode lets you practice an exam event somewhat like the actual exam. It \\ngives you a preset number of questions, from all chapters, with a timed event. Practice exam mode also gives you a score for that timed event.\\nHow to View Only DIKTA Questions by Chapter or Part\\nMost chapters begin with a DIKTA quiz. You can take the quiz to start a chapter, take it again during Chapter Review for more practice, and, as suggested in the “Part Review” sec-tions, repeat the questions for all chapters in the same part.\\nYou can use the DIKTA quiz as printed in the book, or use the PCPT software. The book \\nlists the questions, with the letter answers on the page following the quiz. Appendix C, on the DVD, lists the answers along with an explanation; you might want to keep that PDF handy. \\nUsing PCPT for these questions has some advantages. It gives you a little more practice in \\nhow to read questions from testing software. Also, the explanations to the questions are conveniently located in the PCPT software.\\nTo view these DIKTA questions inside the PCPT software, you need to select Book \\nQuestions, which is the way PCPT references questions found inside the printed book. Then you have to deselect all chapters (with a single click), and then select one or more chapters, as follows:\\nStep 1. Start the PCPT software.\\nStep 2. From the main (home) menu, select the item for this product, with a name like \\nCCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide , and click \\nOpen Exam.\\nStep 3. The top of the next window that appears should list some exams; check the \\nICND2 Book Questions box, and uncheck the other boxes. This selects the \\n“book” questions (that is, the DIKTA questions from the beginning of each chapter).\\nStep 4. On this same window, click at the bottom of the screen to deselect all objec-\\ntives (chapters). Then select the box beside each chapter in the part of the book you are reviewing. \\nStep 5. Select any other options on the right side of the window.\\nStep 6. Click Start to start reviewing the questions.\\nHow to View Part Review Questions \\nThe exam databases you get with this book include a database of questions created solely \\nfor study during the Part Review process. DIKTA questions focus more on facts, to help \\nptg17396363l  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nyou determine whether you know the facts contained within the chapter. The Part Review \\nquestions instead focus more on application of those facts to typical real scenarios, and look more like real exam questions.\\nTo view these questions, follow the same process as you did with DIKTA/book questions, \\nbut select the Part Review database rather than the book database. PCPT has a clear name for this database: Part Review Questions. \\nAbout Mind Maps\\nMind maps are a type of visual organization tool that you can use for many purposes. For instance, you can use mind maps as an alternative way to take notes.\\nYou can also use mind maps to improve how your brain organizes concepts. Mind maps \\nimprove your brain’s connections and relationships between ideas. When you spend time thinking about an area of study, and organize your ideas into a mind map, you strengthen existing mental connections and create new connections, all into your own frame of refer-ence.\\nIn short, mind maps help you internalize what you learn.Each mind map begins with a blank piece of paper or blank window in a mind mapping \\napplication. You then add a large central idea, with branches that move out in any direction. The branches contain smaller concepts, ideas, commands, pictures…whatever idea needs to be represented. Any concepts that can be grouped should be put near each other. As need be, you can create deeper and deeper branches, although for this book’s purposes, most mind maps will not go beyond a couple of levels.\\nNOTE Many books have been written about mind maps, but Tony Buzan often gets credit \\nfor formalizing and popularizing mind maps. You can learn more about mind maps at his website, http://www.tonybuzan.com.\\nFor example, Figure I-5 shows a sample mind map that begins to output some of the IPv6 \\ncontent from Part VIII of the ICND1 book. You might create this kind of mind map when reviewing IPv6 addressing concepts, starting with the big topic of “IPv6 addressing,” and then writing down random terms and ideas. As you start to organize them mentally, you draw lines connecting the ideas, reorganize them, and eventually reach the point where you believe the organization of ideas makes sense to you.\\nFigure I-5 Sample Mind Map\\nptg17396363Introduction  li\\nMind maps may be the least popular but most effective study tool suggested in this book. I \\npersonally find a huge improvement in learning new areas of study when I mind map; I hope you will make the effort to try these tools and see if they work well for you too.\\nFinally, for mind mapping tools, you can just draw them on a blank piece of paper, or find \\nand download a mind map application. I have used Mind Node Pro on a Mac, and we build the sample mind maps with XMIND, which has free versions for Windows, Linux, and OS X.\\nAbout Building Hands-On Skills\\nYou need skills in using Cisco routers and switches, specifically the Cisco CLI. The Cisco CLI is a text-based command-and-response user interface; you type a command, and the device (a router or switch) displays messages in response. To answer sim and simlet ques-tions on the exams, you need to know a lot of commands, and you need to be able to navi-gate to the right place in the CLI to use those commands.\\nThis section walks through the options included in the book, with a brief description of lab \\noptions outside the book.\\nConfig Lab Exercises\\nSome router and switch features require multiple configuration commands. Part of the skill you need to acquire is the ability to remember which configuration commands work together, which ones are required, and which ones are optional. So, the challenge level goes beyond just picking the right parameters on one command. You have to choose which com-mands to use, in which combination, typically on multiple devices. And getting good at that kind of task requires practice.\\nThe Config Labs feature, introduced as a new feature in this edition of the book, helps \\nprovide that practice. Each lab presents a sample lab topology, with some requirements, and you have to decide what to configure on each device. The answer then shows a sample configuration. You job is to create the configuration, and then check your answer versus the supplied answer.\\nAlso for the first time, this edition places the content not only outside the book but also \\non the author’s blog site. To reach my blog sites for ICND1 content or for ICND2 content (two different blogs) and access the Config Labs feature, you can start at my blog launch site (blog.certskills.com) and click from there. \\nblog.certskills.com/ccent/ Wendell’s CCENT (ICND1): In the menus, navigate to Hands On > Config Lab\\nblog.certskills.com/ccna/ Wendell’s CCNA (ICND2): In the menus, navigate to Hands \\nOn > Config Lab\\nBoth blogs are geared toward helping you pass the exams, so feel free to look around. Note that the Config Lab posts should show an image like this in the summary: \\nptg17396363lii  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure I-6 Config Lab Logo in the Author’s Blogs\\nThese Config Labs have several benefits, including the following:\\n■Untethered and responsive: Do them from anywhere, from any web browser, from your\\nphone or tablet, untethered from the book or DVD.\\n■Designed for idle moments: Each lab is designed as a 5- to 10-minute exercise if all youare doing is typing in a text editor or writing your answer on paper.\\n■Two outcomes, both good: Practice getting better and faster with basic configuration,or if you get lost, you have discovered a topic that you can now go back and reread tocomplete your knowledge. Either way, you are a step closer to being ready for the exam!\\n■Blog format: Allows easy adds and changes by me, and easy comments by you.\\n■Self-assessment: As part of final review, you should be able to do all the Config Labs,without help, and with confidence.\\nNote that the blog organizes these Config Lab posts by book chapter, so you can easily use these at both Chapter Review and Part Review. See the “Your Study Plan” element that fol-lows the Introduction for more details about those review sections.\\nA Quick Start with Pearson Network Simulator Lite\\nThe decision of how to get hands-on skills can be a little scary at first. The good news is that you have a free and simple first step to experience the CLI: Install and use the Pearson NetSim Lite that comes with this book.\\nThis book comes with a lite version of the best-selling CCNA Network Simulator from \\nPearson, which provides you with a means, right now, to experience the Cisco CLI. No need to go buy real gear or buy a full simulator to start learning the CLI. Just install NetSim Lite from the DVD in the back of this book.\\nThe latest version of NetSim Lite includes labs associated with Part II of this book. Part I \\nincludes concepts only, with Part II being the first part with commands. So, make sure and use NetSim Lite to learn the basics of the CLI to get a good start. \\nOf course, one reason that NetSim Lite comes on the DVD is that the publisher hopes you \\nwill buy the full product. However, even if you do not use the full product, you can still learn from the labs that come with NetSim Lite while deciding about what options to pur-sue.\\nNOTE The ICND1 and ICND2 books each contain a different version of the Sim Lite product, each with labs that match the book content. If you bought both books, make sure you install both Sim Lite products.\\nptg17396363Introduction  liii\\nThe Pearson Network Simulator\\nThe Config Labs and the Pearson Network Simulator Lite both fill specific needs, and they \\nboth come with the book. However, you need more than those two tools.\\nThe single best option for lab work to do along with this book is the paid version of the \\nPearson Network Simulator. This simulator product simulates Cisco routers and switches so that you can learn for the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications. But more importantly, it focuses on learning for the exam by providing a large number of useful lab exercises. Reader surveys tell us that those people who use the Simulator along with the book love the learning process, and rave about how the book and Simulator work well together.\\nOf course, you need to make a decision for yourself, and consider all the options. \\nThankfully, you can get a great idea of how the full Simulator product works by using the Pearson Network Simulator Lite product included with the book. Both have the same base code and same user interface, and the same types of labs. Try the Lite version, and check out the full product. There is a full product for CCENT only, and another for CCNA R&S (which includes all the labs in the CCENT product, plus others for the ICND2 parts of the content). \\nNote that the Simulator and the books work on a different release schedule. For a time in \\n2016, the version of the Simulator available for purchase will be the Simulator created for the previous versions of the exams (ICND1 100-101, ICND2 200-101, and CCNA 200-120). That product includes approximately 80 percent of the CLI topics in the ICND1 100-105 and ICND2 200-105 books. So during that time, the Simulator is still very useful.\\nOn a practical note, when you want to do labs while reading a chapter or doing Part Review, \\nthe Simulator organizes the labs to match the book. Just look for the “Sort by Chapter” tab in the Simulator’s user interface. However, during the months in 2016 for which the avail-able Simulator is the older edition listing the older exams in the title, you will need to refer back to a PDF that lists those labs versus this book’s organization; find that PDF at http://www.ciscopress.com/title/9781587205798. \\nMore Lab Options\\nIf you decide against using the full Pearson Network Simulator, you still need hands-on experience. You should plan to use some lab environment to practice as much CLI interac-tion as possible. \\nFirst, you can use real Cisco routers and switches. You can buy them, new or used, or bor-\\nrow them at work. You can rent them for a fee. If you have the right mix of gear, you could even do the Config Lab exercises from my blog on that gear, or try and re-create examples from the book.\\nCisco offers a virtualization product that lets you run router and switch operating system \\n(OS) images in a virtual environment. This tool, the Virtual Internet Routing Lab (VIRL), lets you create a lab topology, start the topology, and connect to real router and switch OS images. Check out http://virl.cisco.com for more information.\\nYou can even rent virtual Cisco router and switch lab pods from Cisco, in an offering called \\nCisco Learning Labs. \\nptg17396363liv  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAll these previously mentioned options cost some money, but the next two are generally \\nfree to the user, but with a different catch for each. First, GNS3 works somewhat like VIRL, creating a virtual environment running real Cisco IOS. However, GNS3 is not a Cisco prod-uct, and cannot provide you with the IOS images for legal reasons. \\nCisco also makes a simulator that works very well as a learning tool: Cisco Packet Tracer. \\nHowever, Cisco intends Packet Tracer for use by people currently enrolled in Cisco Networking Academy courses, and not for the general public. So, if you are part of a Cisco Academy, definitely use Packet Tracer. \\nThis book does not tell you what option to use, but you should plan on getting some hands-\\non practice somehow. The important thing to know is that most people need to practice using the Cisco CLI to be ready to pass these exams.\\nFor More Information\\nIf you have any comments about the book, submit them via http://www.ciscopress.com. Just go to the website, select Contact Us, and type your message.\\nCisco might make changes that affect the CCNA certification from time to time. You \\nshould always check http://www.cisco.com/go/ccna and http://www.cisco.com/go/ccent for the latest details.\\nThe CCNA ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide helps you attain CCNA Routing and \\nSwitching certification. This is the CCNA and ICND2 certification book from the only \\nCisco-authorized publisher. We at Cisco Press believe that this book certainly can help you achieve CCNA certification, but the real work is up to you! I trust that your time will be well spent.\\nptg17396363This page intentionally left blank \\nptg17396363\\nYour Study Plan\\nYou just got this book. You have probably already read (or quickly skimmed) the \\nIntroduction. You are probably now wondering whether to start reading here or skip ahead to Chapter 1, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs.”\\nStop for a moment to read this section about how to create your own study plan for the \\nexam(s) you plan to take (ICND1 100-105, ICND2 200-105, and/or CCNA 200-125). Your study will go much better if you take time (maybe 15 minutes) to think about a few key points about how to study before starting on this journey. That is what this section will help you do.\\nA Brief Perspective on Cisco Certification Exams\\nCisco sets the bar pretty high for passing the ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA R&S exams. Most anyone can study and pass these exams, but it takes more than just a quick read through the book and the cash to pay for the exam.\\nThe challenge of these exams comes from many angles. Each of these exams covers a lot of \\nconcepts and many commands specific to Cisco devices. Beyond knowledge, these Cisco exams also require deep skills. You must be able to analyze and predict what really happens in a network. You must be able to configure Cisco devices to work correctly in those net-works. And you must be ready to troubleshoot problems when the network does not work correctly.\\nThe more challenging questions on these exams work a lot like a jigsaw puzzle, but with \\nfour out of every five puzzle pieces not even in the room. To solve the puzzle, you have to mentally re-create the missing pieces. To do that, you must know each networking concept and remember how the concepts work together. \\nFor instance, the ICND2 exam includes many troubleshooting topics, like troubleshooting \\nfor Open Shortest Path Version 2 (OSPFv2). OSPFv2 might fail to form a neighbor rela-tionship with another neighboring router. But a more exam-realistic question would make you think about why a router is missing a route, and that symptom might have a root cause related to OSPF neighbors. Then the question might supply some parts of what you would need to know, like some pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, as represented with the white pieces in Figure 1. You have to apply your knowledge of IP routing and OSPF theory to the facts to come up with some of the other pieces of the puzzle.\\nptg17396363Predict Configuration:\\nOSPF on RoutersGiven: Output of\\nshow ip ospf database\\nGiven:\\nRouter Topology DrawingCalculate:\\nIP subnet IDsPredict Output:\\nshow ip routePredict Output:\\nshow ip Interface brief\\nFigure 1 Filling In Puzzle Pieces with Your Analysis Skills\\nThese skills require that you prepare by doing more than just reading and memorizing what \\nyou read. Of course, you need to read many pages in this book to learn many individual facts and how these facts relate to each other. But a big part of this book lists exercises beyond reading, exercises that help you build the skills to solve these networking puzzles.\\nFive Study Plan Steps \\nThese exams are challenging, but many people pass them every day. So, what do you need to do to be ready to pass, beyond reading and remembering all the facts? You need to develop skills. You need to mentally link each idea with other related ideas. Doing that requires additional work. To help you along the way, the next few pages give you five key planning steps to take so that you can more effectively build those skills and make those connections, before you dive into this exciting but challenging world of learning network-ing on Cisco gear.\\nStep 1: Think in Terms of Parts and Chapters\\nThe first step in your study plan is to get the right mindset about the size and nature of the task you have set out to accomplish. This is a large book. So you cannot think about the book as one huge task or you might get discouraged. And besides, you never sit down to read 900+ pages in one study session. So break the task down into smaller tasks.\\nThe good news here is that the book is designed with obvious breakpoints and built-in \\nextensive review activities. In short, the book is more of a study system than a book. \\nSo the first step in your Study Plan is to visualize the book not as one large book, but as 7 \\nparts. Then, within each part, visualize an average of 4 chapters. Your study plan has you work through the chapters in each part, and then review the material in that part before moving on, as shown in Figure 2.\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 3\\nReview\\nFinal Review\\nPractice Exams\\nDo LabsReview Concepts\\n. . .Chapter 4\\nReviewChapter 1\\nReview\\nChapter 2\\nReview\\nChapter 5\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nE\\nV\\nI\\nE\\nWChapter 9\\nReview\\nChapter 10\\nReviewChapter 7\\nReview\\nChapter 8\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nWChapter 15\\nReviewChapter 13\\nReview\\nChapter 14\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nWChapter 18\\nReviewChapter 16\\nReview\\nChapter 17\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nWPart I Part II Part III Part IV\\nChapter 21\\nReviewChapter 19\\nReview\\nChapter 20\\nReview\\nChapter 24\\nReviewChapter 22\\nReview\\nChapter 23\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nWChapter 28\\nReviewChapter 26\\nReview\\nChapter 27\\nReviewP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nWPart V Part VI Part VII\\nChapter 25\\nReviewChapter 11\\nReview\\nChapter 12\\nReviewChapter 6\\nReview\\nP\\nA\\nR\\nT\\nR\\nEV\\nI\\nE\\nW\\nFigure 2 7 Parts, with an Average of 4 Chapters Each, with Part Reviews\\nNow your plan has the following:\\n1 large task: Read and master all content in the book.\\n7 medium tasks/book: Read and master a part.4 small tasks/part: Read and master a chapter.\\nStep 2: Build Your Study Habits Around the Chapter\\nFor your second step, possibly the most important step, approach each chapter with the \\nsame process: read it, and then study the chapter before moving on.\\nEach chapter follows the same design with three parts, as shown in Figure 3. The chap-\\nter pre-quiz (called a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz, or simply DIKTA quiz) helps you decide how much time to spend reading versus skimming the core of the chapter, called the Foundation Topics.

Go into each study session that begins a new chapter thinking that you have a chance to complete the chapter, or at least make a great start on it. And if you do not have enough time, look for the major headings inside the chapter—each chapter has two to three major headings, and those make a great place to stop reading when you need to wait to complete the reading in the next study session.\\nThe Chapter Review tasks are very important to your exam-day success. Doing these tasks, \\nand doing them at the end of the chapter, really does help you get ready. Do not put off using these tasks until later! The chapter-ending Chapter Review tasks help you with the first phase of deepening your knowledge and skills of the key topics, remembering terms, and linking the concepts together in your brain so that you can remember how it all fits together. The following list describes most of the activities you will find in the “Chapter Review” sections:\\n■Review key topics\\n■Review key terms\\n■Answer DIKTA questions\\n■Do labs\\n■Review memory tables\\n■Review config checklists\\n■Review command tables\\nCheck out the section titled “Find Review Activities on the Web and DVD” later in this planning section for more details.\\nStep 3: Use Book Parts for Major Milestones\\nStudies show that to master a concept and/or skill, you should plan to go through multiple study sessions to review the concept and to practice the skill. The “Chapter Review” section at the end of each chapter is the first such review, while “Part Review,” at the end of each part, acts as that second review.\\nPlan time to do the Part Review task at the end of each part, using the Part Review elements \\nfound at the end of each part. You should expect to spend about as much time on one Part Review as you would on one entire chapter, or maybe a little more for some parts. So in terms of planning your time, think of the Part Review itself as another chapter.\\nFigure 4 lists the names of the parts in this book, with some color coding. Note that Parts \\nII, IV, and V are the parts specific to IPv4. Parts I and III have to do with LANs and WANs, respectively. The top of the figure shows the final two parts of the book, with Part VI about IPv6, and Part VII about a few miscellaneous topics: network management, cloud, and net-work programmability. Each part ends with a “Part Review” section of 2 to 4 pages, with notes about what tools and activities to use.\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIPv4 Routing Protocols (7-12)IPv4 Services: ACLs\\nand QoS (16-18)IPv4 Routing and\\nTroubleshooting (19-21)4 5\\n1 Ethernet LANs (1-6)2Wide Area Networks (13-15) 3IPv6 (22-25) Miscellaneous (26-28) 6 7\\nFigure 4 Parts as Major Milestones\\nChapter Review and Part Review differ in some ways. Chapter Review tasks tend to provide \\na lot of context, so you can focus on mentally adding a specific piece of knowledge, or practicing a specific skill. Part Review activities instead remove a lot of the context, more like real life and the real exams. Removing that context means that you have to exercise your own knowledge and skills. The result: You uncover your weaknesses. The better you become at uncovering weaknesses, and then learning what you are missing in that area, the better prepared you will be for the exam.\\nThe “Part Review” sections use the following kinds of tools in additional to some of the \\nsame tools used for Chapter Review:\\n■Mind maps\\n■Part Review questions with PCPT\\n■Labs\\nAlso, consider setting a goal date for finishing each part of the book (and a reward, as well). Plan a break, some family time, some time out exercising, eating some good food, whatever helps you get refreshed and motivated for the next part.\\nStep 4: Use the Final Review Chapter to Refine Skills and Uncover \\nWeaknesses\\nYour fourth step has one overall task: Follow the details outlined in Chapter 29, “Final \\nReview,” at the end of this book for what to do between finishing the book and taking the exam.\\nThe “Final Review” chapter has two major goals. First, it helps you further develop the \\nanalysis skills you need to answer the more complicated questions on the exam. Many questions require that you connect ideas about concepts, configuration, verification, and troubleshooting. The closer you get to taking the exam, the less reading you should do, and the more you should do other learning activities; this chapter’s tasks give you activities to further develop these skills.\\nThe tasks in the “Final Review” chapter also help you uncover your weak areas. This final \\nelement gives you repetition with high-challenge exam questions, uncovering any gaps in your knowledge. Many of the questions are purposefully designed to test your knowledge of the most common mistakes and misconceptions, helping you avoid some of the common pitfalls people experience with the actual exam.\\nptg17396363Your Study Plan  7\\nStep 5: Set Goals and Track Your Progress\\nYour fifth study plan step spans across the entire timeline of your study effort. Before you \\nstart reading the book and doing the rest of these study tasks, take the time to make a plan, set some goals, and be ready to track your progress.\\nWhile making lists of tasks may or may not appeal to you, depending on your personality, \\ngoal setting can help everyone studying for these exams. And to do the goal setting, you need to know what tasks you plan to do.\\nNOTE If you decide after reading this section that you want to try and do better with goal setting beyond your exam study, check out a blog series I wrote about planning your net-working career here: http://blog.certskills.com/ccna/tag/development-plan/.\\nAs for the list of tasks to do when studying, you do not have to use a detailed task list. (You could list every single task in every chapter-ending “Chapter Review” section, every task in the Part Reviews, and every task in the “Final Review” chapter.) However, listing the major tasks can be enough.\\nYou should track at least two tasks for each typical chapter: reading the “Foundation \\nTopics” section and doing the Chapter Review at the end of the chapter. And, of course, do not forget to list tasks for Part Reviews and Final Review.

Pick reasonable dates that you can meet. When setting your goals, think about how fast you read and the length of each chapter’s “Foundation Topics” section, as listed in the table of contents. Then, when you finish a task sooner than planned, move up the next few goal dates.\\nIf you miss a few dates, do \\nnot start skipping the tasks listed at the ends of the chapters! \\nInstead, think about what is impacting your schedule—real life, commitment, and so on—\\nand either adjust your goals or work a little harder on your study.\\nThings to Do Before Starting the First Chapter\\nNow that you understand the big ideas behind a good study plan for the book, take a few more minutes for a few overhead actions that will help. Before leaving this section, look at some other tasks you should do either now or around the time you are reading the first few chapters, to help make a good start in the book.\\nFind Review Activities on the Web and DVD\\nThe earlier editions of the book have used review activities that relied on the chapter, plus PDF appendixes found on the DVD. Some activities also rely on the PCPT testing software.\\nThis edition is the first Cisco Press certification guide to offer a large set of apps to use \\ninstead of the traditional study features. The Introduction’s section titled “A Big New Feature: Review Applications” details some of the reasons.\\nI encourage you to go ahead and access the book’s companion website to find the review \\napps and explore. Also, spin the DVD, and find the review apps there. Both methods orga-nize the review activities by chapter and by part. \\nNote that this book includes the traditional methods of review as well, with instructions \\nin the book, and matching PDF appendixes in some cases. For instance, all the Key Topics can be reviewed from the companion website and just by flipping pages in the book—you choose which works better for you.\\nShould I Plan to Use the Two-Exam Path or One-Exam Path?\\nTo get a CCNA Routing and Switching certification, you choose either a one-exam or two-exam path. Which should you use? The following is my opinion, but it’s based on chatter and opinions from readers from many years. You can consider the one-exam path if\\n■You already know about half the topics well, through prior experience or study.\\n■You have already proven that you are excellent at learning through self-study.\\nptg17396363Your Study Plan  9\\nOtherwise, in my opinion, you would be better off taking the two-exam path. First, there are \\nno cost savings for most people with the one-exam path. Check the exam prices in your coun-try, for ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA, and then make some comparisons. Assume you pass the tests on the first try: traditionally, the cost is identical for both the ICND1 + ICND2 path and the CCNA path. Or, assume that you fail each exam once: again, the costs are identical. \\nNext, consider the number of topics. From a content perspective, CCNA = ICND1 + \\nICND2. So, both paths require learning the same content.\\nNext, which would you rather have done in school: take an exam over a single semester’s \\nmaterial, or an exam covering the whole year? It is just harder to prepare for an exam that covers more material, so the two-exam path again has an advantage.\\nFinally, the most compelling reason for the two-exam path is that you probably have no \\nexperience with Cisco exams yet. I hope you have a chance to pass many Cisco exams dur-ing your career. The two-exam path gets you to that first exam attempt sooner, and the exam experience teaches you things about the exam and yourself that no study tool can teach you.\\nStudy Options for Those Taking the 200-125 CCNA Exam\\nStudying for the two-exam path has an obvious approach: just use the ICND1 book for the ICND1 exam, and the ICND2 book for the ICND2 exam. Simple enough.\\nIf you do plan to take the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam, you have a couple of study options. \\nFirst, to be clear: The 200-125 CCNA exam covers the topics in the combined ICND1 and ICND2 books. So, using both the ICND1 and ICND2 books covers everything for the 200-125 CCNA R&S exam. The only question is when to read each part of the two books. You have two reasonable options when going with the one-exam option:\\n■Complete all the ICND1 book, then move on to the ICND2 book.\\n■Move back and forth between the ICND1 and ICND2 books, by part, based on topics,\\nas shown in Figure 5.\\nThe first option is pretty obvious, but the second one is less obvious. Figure 5 shows a study plan in which you complete the Ethernet Parts in the ICND1, then the Ethernet Part in ICND2. Similarly, you complete the IPv4 Parts in ICND1, then ICND2, and then the IPv6 Part in both books, and then the final part in both books. \\nPersonally, I am a fan of completing the ICND1 book completely, and then moving on to \\nthe ICND2 book. However, for those of you with a large amount of experience already, this alternate reading plan may work well.\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nICND1 ICND2\\nIV: IP Version 4 Addressing and Subnetting\\nV: Implementing IPV4\\nVI: IPv4 Design and Troubleshooting\\nVII: IPv4 Services: ACLs and NAT\\nVIII: IP Version 6\\nIX: Network Device ManagementI: Networking Fundamentals\\nII: Implementing Basic Ethernet LANs\\nIII: Ethernet: Design, VLANs, Troubleshooting\\nI: Ethernet LANs\\nII: IPv4 Routing Protocols\\nIII: Wide Area Networks\\nIV: IPv4 Services: ACLs and QoS\\nV: IPv4 Routing and Troubleshooting\\nVI: IPv6\\nVII: Miscellaneous1\\n62\\n43\\n5\\n7\\nFigure 5 Alternate Reading Plan for CCNA: Moving Between Books by Part\\nOther Small Tasks Before Getting Started\\nYou need to do a few overhead tasks to install software, find some PDFs, and so on. You \\ncan do these tasks now or do them in your spare moments when you need a study break during the first few chapters of the book. But do these early. That way, if you do stumble upon an installation problem, you have time to work through it before you need a particular tool.\\nRegister (for free) at the Cisco Learning Network (CLN, http://learningnetwork.cisco.com) \\nand join the CCENT/CCNA R&S study group.

Enjoy!\\nptg17396363The ICND1 half of the CCNA R&S exam topics introduces the basics of Ethernet LANs \\nand LAN switching. Part I of this ICND2 Cert Guide builds on that knowledge with six more chapters about LANs and LAN switching.\\nPart I discusses two major topics in depth, to a configuration, verification, and trouble-\\nshooting level on each: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP). Chapters 2 and 3 get fairly deep on STP, a switch feature that requires basic configuration skills, but one that requires a lot of thought to master verification and troubleshooting. Chapter 5 discusses VTP and how it can be used to advertise VLAN configuration around a network of switches, again to a troubleshooting depth.\\nBesides the major focus on STP and VTP, Chapter 6 introduces a small set of new topics: \\n802.1x, AAA authentication, DHCP snooping, and switch stacking.\\nBeyond the four chapters that focus on completely new material (Chapters 2, 3, 5, and 6), \\nChapters 1 and 4 revisit some topics you will already be comfortable with if you remember most of what you learned for the ICND1 half of the CCNA R&S certification. Chapter 1 discusses VLANs and VLAN trunks, topics duplicated in ICND1 and ICND2 exam top-ics. So, this book includes the same chapter in both books. For those of you who read the \\nCCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide , specifically Chapter 11 of that \\nbook, then use Chapter 1 of this book as a review. Make sure you recall the details, and move quickly through that chapter.\\nptg17396363Part I\\nEthernet LANs\\nChapter 1:  Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs \\nChapter 2:  Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts\\nChapter 3:  Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  \\nChapter 4:  LAN Troubleshooting\\nChapter 5:  VLAN Trunking Protocol \\nChapter 6:  Miscellaneous LAN Topics\\nPart I Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 1\\nImplementing Ethernet Virtual \\nLANs\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n1.0 LAN Switching Technologies \\n1.1 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot VLANs (normal/extended range) spanning mul-\\ntiple switches\\n1.1.a Access ports (data and voice)\\n1.1.b Default VLAN\\n1.2 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot interswitch connectivity \\n1.2.a Add and remove VLANs on a trunk1.2.b DTP and VTP (v1&v2)\\nVirtual LANs (VLAN) have an impact on many parts of a switch’s logic.

The \\nchapter breaks the topics into concepts in the first section of the chapter, with configura-tion and verification in the second half. The topics include VLANs, VLAN trunking, routing between VLANs, plus voice and data VLANs. (Chapter 4, “LAN Troubleshooting,” revisits some of these topics from a troubleshooting perspective.)\\nFor you ICND1 Cert Guide readers, note that this chapter is identical to the ICND1 \\n100-105 Cert Guide’s Chapter 11. Both the ICND1 and ICND2 exams include specific exam topics about most of the content in this chapter. By using the exact same chapter for duplicate exam topics between the two books, hopefully those of you who remember a lot about these topics can move quickly through this chapter. For those who do not remember as much, just treat it as a normal chapter.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help \\nyou decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

For example, from one perspective, a LAN includes all the user devices, servers, switches, routers, cables, and wireless access points in one location. However, an alternative narrower definition of a LAN can help in understanding the concept of a virtual LAN:\\nA LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain.\\nA broadcast domain includes the set of all LAN-connected devices, so that when any of the devices sends a broadcast frame, all the other devices get a copy of the frame. So, from one perspective, you can think of a LAN and a broadcast domain as being basically the same thing.\\nWithout VLANs, a switch considers all its interfaces to be in the same broadcast domain. \\nThat is, for one switch, when a broadcast frame entered one switch port, the switch for-warded that broadcast frame out all other ports. With that logic, to create two different LAN broadcast domains, you had to buy two different Ethernet LAN switches, as shown in Figure 1-1.\\nDino\\nFredWilma\\nBetty SW1 SW2\\nSubnet 2 Subnet 1Broadcast\\nDomain 2Broadcast\\nDomain 1\\nFigure 1-1 Creating Two Broadcast Domains with Two Physical Switches and No VLANs\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  17\\nWith support for VLANs, a single switch can accomplish the same goals of the design in \\nFigure 1-1—to create two broadcast domains—with a single switch. With VLANs, a switch can configure some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another, creating multiple broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by the switch are called virtual LANs (VLAN).\\nFor example, in Figure 1-2, the single switch creates two VLANs, treating the ports in each \\nVLAN as being completely separate. The switch would never forward a frame sent by Dino (in VLAN 1) over to either Wilma or Betty (in VLAN 2).\\nFredDino\\nBettyWilmaBroadcast\\nDomain 2(VLAN 2)Broadcast\\nDomain 1\\n(VLAN 1)\\nSW1\\nSubnet 2 Subnet 1\\nFigure 1-2 Creating Two Broadcast Domains Using One Switch and VLANs\\nDesigning   campus LANs to use more VLANs, each with a smaller number of devices, often \\nhelps improve the LAN in many ways. For example, a broadcast sent by one host in a VLAN will be received and processed by all the other hosts in the VLAN—but not by hosts in a different VLAN. Limiting the number of hosts that receive a single broadcast frame reduces the number of hosts that waste effort processing unneeded broadcasts. It also reduces security risks, because fewer hosts see frames sent by any one host. These are just a few reasons for separating hosts into different VLANs. The following list summarizes the most common reasons for choosing to create smaller broadcast domains (VLANs):\\n■ To reduce CPU overhead on each device by reducing the number of devices that receiveeach broadcast frame\\n■ To reduce security risks by reducing the number of hosts that receive copies of framesthat the switches flood (broadcasts, multicasts, and unknown unicasts)\\n■ To improve security for hosts that send sensitive data by keeping those hosts on a sepa-rate VLAN\\n■ To create more flexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that worktogether, instead of by physical location\\n■ To solve problems more quickly, because the failure domain for many problems is thesame set of devices as those in the same broadcast domain\\n■ To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to asingle access   switch\\nThis chapter does not examine all the reasons for VLANs in more depth. However, know that most enterprise networks use VLANs quite a bit. The rest of this chapter looks closely \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B  2 D  3 B  4 A, C  5 A, B  6 B, C\\nptg1739636318  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nat the mechanics of how VLANs work across multiple Cisco switches, including the \\nrequired configuration. To that end, the next section examines VLAN trunking, a feature required when installing a VLAN that exists on more than one LAN   switch.\\nCreating Multiswitch VLANs Using Trunking\\nConfiguring    VLANs on a single switch requires only a little effort: Y ou simply configure each port to tell it the VLAN number to which the port belongs. With multiple switches, you have to consider additional concepts about how to forward traffic between the switches.\\nWhen using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, the switches \\nneed to use VLAN trunking  on the links between the switches. VLAN trunking causes \\nthe switches to use a process called VLAN tagging , by which the sending switch adds \\nanother header to the frame before sending it over the trunk. This extra trunking header includes a     VLAN identifier  (VLAN ID) field so that the sending switch can associate the \\nframe with a particular VLAN ID, and the receiving switch can then know in what VLAN each frame belongs.\\nFigure 1-3 shows an example that demonstrates VLANs that exist on multiple switches, \\nbut it does not use trunking. First, the design uses two VLANs: VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. Each switch has two ports assigned to each VLAN, so each VLAN exists in both switches. To forward traffic in VLAN 10 between the two switches, the design includes a link between switches, with that link fully inside VLAN 10. Likewise, to support VLAN 20 traf-fic between switches, the design uses a second link between switches, with that link inside VLAN 20.\\nVLAN 20VLAN 10\\nLink is in VLAN 10\\nLink is in VLAN 20SW111 12\\n21 22SW213 14\\n23 24\\nFigure 1-3 Multiswitch VLAN Without VLAN Trunking\\nThe design in Figure 1-3 functions perfectly. For example, PC11 (in VLAN 10) can send a \\nframe to PC14. The frame flows into SW1, over the top link (the one that is in VLAN 10) and over to SW2.\\nThe design shown in Figure 1-3 works, but it simply does not scale very well. It requires \\none physical link between switches to support every VLAN. If a design needed 10 or 20 VLANs, you would need 10 or 20 links between switches, and you would use 10 or 20 switch ports (on each switch) for those    links.\\nVLAN Tagging Concepts\\nVLAN       trunking creates one link between switches that supports as many VLANs as you need. As a VLAN trunk, the switches treat the link as if it were a part of all the VLANs. At \\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  19\\nthe same time, the trunk keeps the VLAN traffic separate, so frames in VLAN 10 would not \\ngo to devices in VLAN 20, and vice versa, because each frame is identified by VLAN num-ber as it crosses the trunk. Figure 1-4 shows the idea, with a single physical link between the two switches.\\nVLAN 20VLAN 10\\nSW1 SW220 10 20 10 20\\nFigure 1-4 Multiswitch VLAN with Trunking\\nThe use of trunking allows switches to pass frames from multiple VLANs over a single \\nphysical connection by adding a small header to the Ethernet frame. For example, Figure 1-5 shows PC11 sending a broadcast frame on interface Fa0/1 at Step 1. To flood the frame, switch SW1 needs to forward the broadcast frame to switch SW2. However, SW1 needs to let SW2 know that the frame is part of VLAN 10, so that after the frame is received, SW2 will flood the frame only into VLAN 10, and not into VLAN 20. So, as shown at Step 2, before sending the frame, SW1 adds a VLAN header to the original Ethernet frame, with the VLAN header listing a VLAN ID of 10 in this    case.\\n20 10 20 10 20VLAN 10\\nVLAN 2013\\n0/1 0/2\\nG0/2 G0/1\\n0/3 0/414\\n23 24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 2011\\n0/1\\n0/3 0/4\\n21 223 3Ethernet1 Ethernet\\n2VLAN 10 EthernetSW1 SW2\\nFigure 1-5 VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches\\nWhen SW2 receives the frame, it understands that the frame is in VLAN 10. SW2 then \\nremoves the VLAN header, forwarding the original frame out its interfaces in VLAN 10 (Step 3).\\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFor another example, consider the case when PC21 (in VLAN 20) sends a broadcast. \\nSW1 sends the broadcast out port Fa0/4 (because that port is in VLAN 20) and out Gi0/1 (because it is a trunk, meaning that it supports multiple different VLANs). SW1 adds a trunking header to the frame, listing a VLAN ID of 20. SW2 strips off the trunking header after determining that the frame is part of VLAN 20, so SW2 knows to forward the frame out only ports Fa0/3 and Fa0/4, because they are in VLAN 20, and not out ports Fa0/1 and Fa0/2, because they are in      VLAN 10.\\nThe 802.1Q and ISL VLAN Trunking Protocols\\nCisco         has supported two different trunking protocols over the years: Inter-Switch Link (ISL) and IEEE 802.1Q. Cisco created ISL long before 802.1Q, in part because the IEEE had not yet defined a VLAN trunking standard. Y ears later, the IEEE completed work on the 802.1Q standard, which defines a different way to do trunking. Today, 802.1Q has become the more popular trunking protocol, with Cisco not even supporting ISL in some of its newer models of LAN switches, including the 2960 switches used in the examples in this book.\\nWhile both ISL and 802.1Q tag each frame with the VLAN ID, the details differ. 802.1Q \\ninserts an extra 4-byte 802.1Q VLAN header into the original frame’s Ethernet header, as shown at the top of Figure 1-6. As for the fields in the 802.1Q header, only the 12-bit VLAN ID field inside the 802.1Q header matters for topics discussed in this book. This 12-bit field supports a theoretical maximum of 2\\n12 (4096) VLANs, but in practice it sup-\\nports a maximum of 4094. (Both 802.1Q and ISL use 12 bits to tag the VLAN ID, with two reserved values         [0 and 4095].)\\n802.1Q\\nDest. Address Source Address Type Data FCS Tag\\nType Priority Flag VLAN ID (12 Bits)\\nFigure 1-6 802.1Q Trunking\\nCisco         switches break the range of VLAN IDs (1–4094) into two ranges: the normal range and the extended range. All switches can use normal-range VLANs with values from 1 to 1005. Only some switches can use extended-range VLANs with VLAN IDs from 1006 to 4094. The rules for which switches can use extended-range VLANs depend on the con-figuration of the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), which is discussed briefly in the section “VLAN Trunking Configuration,” later in this chapter.\\n802.1Q also defines one special VLAN ID on each trunk as the    native VLAN (defaulting \\nto use VLAN 1). By definition, 802.1Q simply does not add an 802.1Q header to frames in \\nthe native VLAN. When the switch on the other side of the trunk receives a frame that does not have an 802.1Q header, the receiving switch knows that the frame is part of the native VLAN. Note that because of this behavior, both switches must agree on which VLAN is the native VLAN.\\nThe 802.1Q native VLAN provides some interesting functions, mainly to support connec-\\ntions to devices that do not understand trunking. For example, a Cisco switch could be \\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  21\\ncabled to a switch that does not understand 802.1Q trunking. The Cisco switch could send \\nframes in the native VLAN—meaning that the frame has no trunking header—so that the other switch would understand the frame. The native VLAN concept gives switches the capability of at least passing traffic in one VLAN (the native VLAN), which can allow some basic functions, like reachability to telnet into a         switch.\\nForwarding Data Between VLANs\\nIf you     create a campus LAN that contains many VLANs, you typically still need all devices to be able to send data to all other devices. This next topic discusses some concepts about how to route data between those VLANs.\\nFirst, it helps to know a few terms about some categories of LAN switches. All the Ethernet \\nswitch functions described in the ICND1 Cert Guide use the details and logic defined by OSI Layer 2 protocols. For example, many chapters of the ICND1 Cert Guide discussed how LAN switches receive Ethernet frames (a Layer 2 concept), look at the destination Ethernet MAC address (a Layer 2 address), and forward the Ethernet frame out some other interface. This chapter has already discussed the concept of VLANs as broadcast domains, which is yet another Layer 2 concept.\\nWhile some LAN switches work just as described in the ICND1 Cert Guide, some LAN \\nswitches have even more functions. LAN switches that forward data based on Layer 2 logic often go by the name   Layer 2 switch. However, some other switches can do some functions \\nlike a router, using additional logic defined by Layer 3 protocols. These switches go by the name multilayer switch, or    Layer 3 switch. This section first discusses how to forward data \\nbetween VLANs when using Layer 2 switches and ends with a brief discussion of how to use Layer 3    switches.\\nRouting Packets Between VLANs with a Router\\nWhen     including VLANs in a campus LAN design, the devices in a VLAN need to be in the same subnet. Following the same design logic, devices in different VLANs need to be in dif-ferent subnets. For example, in Figure 1-7, the two PCs on the left sit in VLAN 10, in sub-net 10. The two PCs on the right sit in a different VLAN (20), with a different subnet (20).\\nWilma\\nBettyDinoVLAN 20\\nSubnet 20VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10\\nFred\\nFigure 1-7 Layer 2 Switch Does Not Route Between the VLANs\\nNOTE The figure refers to subnets somewhat generally, like “subnet 10,” just so the sub-\\nnet numbers do not distract. Also, note that the subnet numbers do not have to be the same number as the VLAN numbers.\\nFigure 1-7 shows the switch as if it were two switches broken in two to emphasize the point that Layer 2 switches will not forward data between two VLANs. When configured with some ports in VLAN 10 and others in VLAN 20, the switch acts like two separate switches in which it will forward traffic. In fact, one goal of VLANs is to separate traffic in one VLAN from another, preventing frames in one VLAN from leaking over to other VLANs. \\nptg1739636322  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFor example, when Dino (in VLAN 10) sends any Ethernet frame, if SW1 is a Layer 2 \\nswitch, that switch will not forward the frame to the PCs on the right in VLAN 20.\\nThe network as a whole needs to support traffic flowing into and out of each VLAN, even \\nthough the Layer 2 switch does not forward frames outside a VLAN. The job of forwarding data into and out of a VLAN falls to routers. Instead of switching Layer 2 Ethernet frames between the two VLANs, the network     must route Layer 3 packets between the two subnets.\\nThat previous paragraph has some very specific wording related to Layers 2 and 3, so take a \\nmoment to reread and reconsider it for a moment. The Layer 2 logic does not let the Layer 2 switch forward the Layer 2 protocol data unit (L2PDU), the Ethernet frame, between VLANs. However, routers can route Layer 3 PDUs (L3PDU), packets, between subnets as their normal job in life.\\nFor example, Figure 1-8 shows a router that can route packets between subnets 10 and 20. \\nThe figure shows the same Layer 2 switch as shown in Figure 1-7, with the same perspective of the switch being split into parts with two different VLANs, and with the same PCs in the same VLANs and subnets. Now Router R1 has one LAN physical interface connected to the switch and assigned to VLAN 10, and a second physical interface connected to the switch and assigned to VLAN 20. With an interface connected to each subnet, the Layer 2 switch can keep doing its job—forwarding frames inside a VLAN, while the router can do its job—routing IP packets between the     subnets.\\nWilma\\nBettyDino\\nF0/0 F0/1VLAN 20\\nSubnet 20VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10\\nFred\\nR1\\nFigure 1-8 Routing Between Two VLANs on Two Physical Interfaces\\nThe figure shows an IP packet being routed from Fred, which sits in one VLAN/subnet, to \\nBetty, which sits in the other. The Layer 2 switch forwards two different Layer 2 Ethernet frames: one in VLAN 10, from Fred to R1’s F0/0 interface, and the other in VLAN 20, from R1’s F0/1 interface to Betty. From a Layer 3 perspective, Fred sends the IP packet to its default router (R1), and R1 routes the packet out another interface (F0/1) into another sub-net where Betty resides.\\nWhile the design shown in Figure 1-8 works, it uses too many physical interfaces, one per \\nVLAN. A much less expensive (and much preferred) option uses a VLAN trunk between the switch and router, requiring only one physical link between the router and switch, while supporting all VLANs. Trunking can work between any two devices that choose to support it: between two switches, between a router and a switch, or even between server hardware and a     switch.\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  23\\nFigure 1-9 shows the same design idea as Figure 1-8, with the same packet being sent from \\nFred to Betty, except now R1 uses VLAN trunking instead of a separate link for each     VLAN.\\nFred\\nF0/0Dino\\nBettyWilmaVLAN 20\\nSubnet 20VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10\\nSW1\\nR11 2\\nFigure 1-9 Routing Between Two VLANs Using a Trunk on the Router\\nNOTE Because   the router has a single physical link connected to the LAN switch, this \\ndesign is sometimes called a router-on-a-stick.\\nAs a brief aside about terminology, many people describe the concept in Figures 1-8 and 1-9 as “routing packets between VLANs.” Y ou can use that phrase, and people know what you mean. However, note that this phrase is not literally true, because it refers to routing packets (a Layer 3 concept) and VLANs (a Layer 2 concept). It just takes fewer words to say some-thing like “routing between VLANs” rather than the literally     true but long “routing Layer 3 packets between Layer 3 subnets, with those subnets each mapping to a Layer 2 VLAN.”\\nRouting Packets with a Layer 3 Switch\\nRouting       packets using a physical router, even with the VLAN trunk in the router-on-a-stick model shown in Figure 1-9, still has one significant problem: performance. The physical link puts an upper limit on how many bits can be routed, and less expensive routers tend to be less powerful, and might not be able to route a large enough number of packets per second (pps) to keep up with the traffic volumes.\\nThe ultimate solution moves the routing functions inside the LAN switch hardware. \\nVendors long ago started combining the hardware and software features of their Layer 2 LAN switches, plus their Layer 3 routers, creating products called Layer 3 switches (also known as multilayer switches). Layer 3 switches can be configured to act only as a Layer 2 switch, or they can be configured to do both Layer 2 switching as well as Layer 3 routing.\\nToday, many medium- to large-sized enterprise campus LANs use Layer 3 switches to route \\npackets between subnets (VLANs) in a campus.\\nIn concept, a Layer 3 switch works a lot like the original two devices on which the Layer 3 \\nswitch is based: a Layer 2 LAN switch and a Layer 3 router. In fact, if you take the concepts and packet flow shown in Figure 1-8, with a separate Layer 2 switch and Layer 3 router, and then imagine all those features happening inside one device, you have the general idea of what a Layer 3 switch does. Figure 1-10 shows that exact concept, repeating many details of Figure 1-8, but with an overlay that shows the one Layer 3 switch doing the Layer 2 switch functions and the separate Layer 3 routing       function.\\nptg1739636324  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFred\\nInterface\\n  VLAN 10Interface  VLAN 20Layer 3 Switch\\nDino\\nBettyWilma\\nLayer 2 Switch\\nLayer 3 Router(All Functions in Middle Box)\\nVLAN 20Subnet 20VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10\\nFigure 1-10 Multilayer Switch: Layer 2 Switching with Layer 3 Routing in One Device\\nThis chapter introduces the core concepts of routing IP packets between VLANs (or more \\naccurately, between the subnets on the VLANs). Chapter 19, “IPv4 Routing in the LAN,” shows how to configure designs that use an external router with router-on-a-stick. This chapter now turns its attention to configuration and verification tasks for VLANs and VLAN       trunks.\\nVLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and \\nVerification\\nCisco switches do not require any configuration to work. You can purchase Cisco switches, \\ninstall devices with the correct cabling, turn on the switches, and they work. You would never need to configure the switch, and it would work fine, even if you interconnected switches, until you needed more than one VLAN. But if you want to use VLANs—and most enterprise networks do—you need to add some configuration.\\nThis chapter separates the VLAN configuration details into two major sections. The first \\nsection looks at how to configure access interfaces, which are switch interfaces that do not use VLAN trunking. The second part shows how to configure interfaces that do use VLAN trunking.\\nCreating VLANs and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface\\nThis section    shows how to create a VLAN, give the VLAN a name, and assign interfaces to a VLAN. To focus on these basic details, this section shows examples using a single switch, so VLAN trunking is not needed.\\nFor a Cisco switch to forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must be configured \\nto believe that the VLAN exists. In addition, the switch must have nontrunking interfaces (called  access interfaces) assigned to the VLAN, and/or trunks that support the VLAN. The \\nconfiguration steps for access interfaces are as follows, with the trunk configuration shown later in the section “VLAN Trunking Configuration”:\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  25\\nStep 1. To configure a new VLAN, follow these steps:\\nA. From configuration mode, use the   vlan vlan-id command in global con-\\nfiguration mode to create the VLAN and to move the user into VLAN con-\\nfiguration mode.\\nB. (Optional) Use the   name name command in VLAN configuration mode \\nto list a name for the VLAN. If not configured, the VLAN name is VLANZZZZ, where ZZZZ is the four-digit decimal VLAN ID.\\nStep 2. For each access interface (each interface that does not trunk, but instead belongs to a single VLAN), follow these steps:\\nA. Use the   interface type number command in global configuration mode to \\nmove into interface configuration mode for each desired interface.\\nB. Use the   switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configu-\\nration mode to specify the VLAN number associated with that interface.\\nC. (Optional) Use the   switchport mode access command in interface configu-\\nration mode to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk).\\nWhile the list might look a little daunting, the process on a single switch is actually pretty simple. For example, if you want to put the switch’s ports in three VLANs—11, 12, and 13—you just add three vlan commands: vlan 11, vlan 12, and vlan 13. Then, for each inter-\\nface, add a switchport access vlan 11 (or 12 or 13) command to assign that interface    to the proper VLAN.\\nNOTE The term    default VLAN (as shown in the exam topics) refers to the default setting on the   switchport access vlan vlan-id command, and that default is VLAN ID 1. In other \\nwords, by default, each port is assigned to access VLAN 1.\\nVLAN Configuration Example 1: Full VLAN Configuration\\nExample     1-1 shows the configuration process of adding a new VLAN and assigning access interfaces to that VLAN. Figure 1-11 shows the network used in the example, with one LAN switch (SW1) and two hosts in each of three VLANs (1, 2, and 3). The example shows the details of the two-step process for VLAN 2 and the interfaces in VLAN 2, with the con-figuration of VLAN 3 deferred until the next example.\\nFa0/15\\nFa0/16VLAN 3\\nFa0/12\\nFa0/11VLAN 1VLAN 2\\nFa0/13 Fa0/14\\nSW1\\nFigure 1-11 Network with One Switch and Three VLANsConfig\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636326  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 1-1 Configuring     VLANs and Assigning VLANs to Interfaces\\nSW1#   show vlan brief\\nVLAN Name                             Status    Ports\\n---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------\\n1    default active    Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4\\nFa0/5, Fa0/6, Fa0/7, Fa0/8\\nFa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11, Fa0/12\\nFa0/13, Fa0/14, Fa0/15, Fa0/16\\nFa0/17, Fa0/18, Fa0/19, Fa0/20\\nFa0/21, Fa0/22, Fa0/23, Fa0/24\\nGi0/1, Gi0/2\\n1002 fddi-default act/unsup\\n1003 token-ring-default act/unsup\\n1004 fddinet-default act/unsup\\n1005 trnet-default act/unsup\\n!

(VLAN 1 cannot be \\ndeleted, but can be used. VLANs 1002–1005 cannot be deleted and cannot be used as access VLANs today.) In particular, note that this 2960 switch has 24 Fast Ethernet ports (Fa0/1–Fa0/24) and two Gigabit Ethernet ports (Gi0/1 and Gi0/2), all of which are listed as being in VLAN 1 per that first command’s     output.\\nNext, the example shows the process of creating VLAN 2 and assigning interfaces Fa0/13 \\nand Fa0/14 to VLAN 2. Note in particular that the example uses the   interface range com-\\nmand, which causes the switchport access vlan 2 interface subcommand to be applied to both interfaces in the range, as confirmed in the show running-config command output at the end of the example.\\nAfter the configuration has been added, to list the new VLAN, the example repeats the \\n  show vlan brief command. Note that this command lists VLAN 2, name Freds-vlan, and the interfaces assigned to that VLAN (Fa0/13 and Fa0/14). The show vlan id 2 command that follows then confirms that ports Fa0/13 and Fa0/14 are assigned to VLAN 2.\\nptg1739636328  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe example surrounding Figure 1-11 uses six switch ports, all of which need to operate as \\naccess ports. That is, each port should not use trunking, but instead should be assigned to a single VLAN, as assigned by the   switchport access vlan vlan-id command. However, as \\nconfigured in Example 1-1, these interfaces could negotiate to later become trunk ports, because the switch defaults to allow the port to negotiate trunking and decide whether to act as an access interface or as a trunk interface.\\nFor ports that should always act as access ports, add the optional interface subcommand \\n  switchport mode access. This command tells the switch to only allow the interface to be an access interface. The upcoming section “VLAN Trunking Configuration” discusses more details about the commands that allow a port to negotiate whether it should use     trunking.\\nNOTE The book includes a video that works through a different VLAN configuration example as well. You can find the video on the DVD and on the companion website. \\nVLAN Configuration Example 2: Shorter VLAN Configuration\\nExample     1-1 shows several of the optional configuration commands, with a side effect of being a bit longer than is required. Example 1-2 shows a much briefer alternative configura-tion, picking up the story where Example 1-1 ended and showing the addition of VLAN 3 (as shown in Figure 1-11). Note that SW1 does not know about VLAN 3 at the beginning of this example.\\nExample 1-2 Shorter VLAN Configuration Example (VLAN 3)\\nSW1#   configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

This example begins with SW1 not knowing about VLAN 3. When the  switchport access vlan 3 interface subcommand was \\nused, the switch realized that VLAN 3 did not exist, and as noted in the shaded message in the example, the switch created VLAN 3, using a default name (VLAN0003). No other steps are required to create the VLAN. At the end of the process, VLAN 3 exists in the switch, and interfaces Fa0/15 and Fa0/16 are in VLAN 3, as noted in the shaded part of the   show vlan brief command     output.\\nVLAN Trunking Protocol\\nBefore      showing more configuration examples, you also need to know something about a Cisco protocol and tool called the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP). VTP is a Cisco propri-etary tool on Cisco switches that advertises each VLAN configured in one switch (with the vlan number command) so that all the other switches in the campus learn about that VLAN. \\nHowever, for various reasons, many enterprises choose not to use VTP.\\nEach switch can use one of three VTP modes: server, client, or transparent. Switches use \\neither VTP server or client mode when the switch wants to use VTP for its intended pur-pose of dynamically advertising VLAN configuration information. However, with many Cisco switches and IOS versions, VTP cannot be completely disabled on a Cisco switch; instead, the switch disables VTP by using VTP transparent mode.\\nChapter 5, “VLAN Trunking Protocol,” discusses how to make use of VTP. Chapters 1 \\nthrough 4 mostly ignore VTP. To that end, all examples in this book use switches that have been set either to use VTP transparent mode (with the   vtp mode transparent global com-\\nmand) or to disable it (with the   vtp mode off global command). Both options allow the \\nadministrator to configure both standard- and extended-range VLANs, and the switch lists the vlan commands in the running-config file.\\nFinally, on a practical note, if you happen to do lab exercises with real switches or with simulators, and you see unusual results with VLANs, check the VTP status with the   show \\nvtp status command. If your switch uses VTP server or client mode, you will find:\\n■ The server switches can configure VLANs in the standard range only (1–1005).\\n■ The client switches cannot configure VLANs.\\n■ Both servers and clients may be learning new VLANs from other switches, and seeingtheir VLANs deleted by other switches, because of VTP.\\n■ The show running-config command does not list any vlan commands.\\nIf possible in lab, switch to VTP transparent mode and ignore VTP for your switch con-figuration practice until you are ready to focus on how VTP works when studying for the ICND2 exam      topics.\\nNOTE Do not change VTP settings on any switch that also connects to the production network until you know how VTP works as explained in Chapter 5.\\nptg1739636330  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nVLAN Trunking Configuration\\nTrunking      configuration between two Cisco switches can be very simple if you just statically \\nconfigure trunking. For example, if two Cisco 2960 switches connect to each other, they support only 802.1Q and not ISL. You could literally add one interface subcommand for the switch interface on each side of the link (  switchport mode trunk), and you would create \\na VLAN trunk that supported all the VLANs known to each switch.\\nHowever, trunking configuration on Cisco switches includes many more options, including \\nseveral options for dynamically negotiating various trunking settings. The configuration can either predefine different settings or tell the switch to negotiate the settings, as follows:\\n■ The type of trunking: IEEE 802.1Q, ISL, or negotiate which one to use\\n■ The administrative mode: Whether to always trunk, always not trunk, or negotiate\\nFirst, consider the type of trunking. Cisco switches that support ISL and 802.1Q can negoti-ate which type to use, using the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). If both switches support both protocols, they use ISL; otherwise, they use the protocol that both support. Today, many Cisco switches do not support the older ISL trunking protocol. Switches that support both types of trunking use the   switchport trunk encapsulation {dot1q | isl | negotiate} inter-\\nface subcommand to either configure the type or allow DTP to negotiate the type.\\nDTP can also negotiate whether the two devices on the link agree to trunk at all, as \\nguided by the local switch port’s administrative mode. The administrative mode refers to the configuration setting for whether trunking should be used. Each interface also has an operational mode, which refers to what is currently happening on the interface, and \\nmight have been chosen by DTP’s negotiation with the other device. Cisco switches use the   switchport mode interface subcommand to define the administrative trunking mode, as listed in      Table 1-2.\\nTable 1-2 Trunking Administrative Mode Options with the switchport mode Command\\nCommand Option Description\\naccess Always act as an access (nontrunk) port\\ntrunk Always act as a trunk port\\ndynamic desirable Initiates negotiation messages and responds to negotiation messages to \\ndynamically choose whether to start using trunking\\ndynamic auto Passively waits to receive trunk negotiation messages, at which point the switch will respond and   negotiate whether to use trunking\\nFor example, consider the two switches shown in Figure 1-12. This figure shows an expansion \\nof the network shown in Figure 1-11, with a trunk to a new switch (SW2) and with parts of VLANs 1 and 3 on ports attached to SW2. The two switches use a Gigabit Ethernet link for the trunk. In this case, the trunk does not dynamically form by default, because both (2960) switches default to an administrative mode of dynamic auto, meaning that neither switch initi-ates the trunk negotiation process. By changing one switch to use dynamic desirable mode, which does initiate the negotiation, the switches negotiate to use trunking, specifically 802.1Q because the 2960s support only      802.1Q.\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  31\\nFa0/15\\nFa0/16VLAN 3\\nFa0/12\\nFa0/11VLAN 1VLAN 2\\nFa0/13 Fa0/14\\nSW1\\nFa0/23Fa0/24Fa0/22\\nFa0/21\\nSW2Gi0/1\\nTrunk\\nGi0/2\\nFigure 1-12 Network with Two Switches and Three VLANs\\nExample 1-3 begins by showing the two switches in Figure 1-12 with the default configura-\\ntion so that the two switches do not trunk.\\nExample 1-3 Initial (Default) State: Not Trunking Between SW1 and SW2\\nSW1#   show interfaces gigabit 0/1 switchport\\nName: Gi0/1\\nSwitchport: Enabled\\nAdministrative Mode: dynamic auto\\nOperational Mode: static accessAdministrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q\\nOperational Trunking Encapsulation: native\\nNegotiation of Trunking: On\\nAccess Mode VLAN: 1 (default)Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)\\nAdministrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled\\nVoice VLAN: none\\nAccess Mode VLAN: 1 (default)Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)\\nAdministrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled\\nVoice VLAN: none\\nAdministrative private-vlan host-association: noneAdministrative private-vlan mapping: none\\nAdministrative private-vlan trunk native VLAN: none\\nAdministrative private-vlan trunk Native VLAN tagging: enabled\\nAdministrative private-vlan trunk encapsulation: dot1qAdministrative private-vlan trunk normal VLANs: none\\nAdministrative private-vlan trunk private VLANs: none\\nptg1739636332  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nOperational private-vlan: none\\nTrunking VLANs Enabled: ALL\\nPruning VLANs Enabled: 2-1001\\nCapture Mode Disabled\\nCapture VLANs Allowed: ALL\\nProtected: false\\nUnknown unicast blocked: disabled\\nUnknown multicast blocked: disabledAppliance trust: none\\n!

The output lists the default administrative mode \\nsetting of dynamic auto. Because SW2 also defaults to dynamic auto, the command lists SW1’s operational status as “access,” meaning that it is not trunking. (“Dynamic auto” tells both switches to sit there and wait on the other switch to start the negotiations.) The third shaded line points out the only supported type of trunking (802.1Q) on this 2960 switch. (On a switch that supports both ISL and 802.1Q, this value would by default list “negoti-ate,” to mean that the type of encapsulation is negotiated.) Finally, the operational trunking type is listed as “native,” which is a reference to the 802.1Q native VLAN.\\nThe end of the example shows the output of the   show interfaces trunk command, but with \\nno output. This command lists information about all interfaces that currently operationally \\ntrunk; that is, it lists interfaces that currently use VLAN trunking. With no interfaces listed, this command also confirms that the link between switches is not trunking.\\nNext, consider Example 1-4, which shows the new configuration that enables trunking. In \\nthis case, SW1 is configured with the   switchport mode dynamic desirable command, which \\nasks the switch to both negotiate as well as to begin the negotiation process, rather than waiting on the other device. As soon as the command is issued, log messages appear show-ing that the interface goes down and then back up again, which happens when the interface transitions from access mode to trunk      mode.\\nExample 1-4 SW1 Changes from Dynamic Auto to Dynamic Desirable\\nSW1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

Table 1-3 lists the combinations of the trunking administrative modes and the expected operational mode (trunk or access) resulting from the configured settings. The table lists the administrative mode used on one end of the link on the left, and the administrative mode on the switch on the other end of the link across the top of the      table.\\nTable 1-3 Expected Trunking Operational Mode Based on the Configured Administrative \\nModes\\nAdministrative Mode A ccess Dyn amic Auto Trunk Dynamic Desirable\\naccess Access Access Do Not Use1Access\\ndynamic auto Access Access Trunk Trunk\\ntrunk Do Not Use1Trunk Trunk Trunk\\ndynamic desirable Access Trunk Trunk Trunk\\n1 When two switches configure a mode of “access” on one end and “trunk” on the other, problems occur. \\nAvoid this combination.\\nFinally, before leaving the discussion of configuring trunks, Cisco recommends disabling \\ntrunk negotiation on most ports for better security. The majority of switch ports on most switches will be used to connect to users. As a matter of habit, you can disable DTP nego-tiations altogether using the   switchport nonegotiate interface      subcommand.\\nImplementing Interfaces Connected to Phones\\nThis    next topic is a strange topic, at least in the context of access links and trunk links. In the world of IP telephony, telephones use Ethernet ports to connect to an Ethernet network so they can use IP to send and receive voice traffic sent via IP packets. To make that work, the switch’s Ethernet port acts like an access port—but at the same time, the port acts like a trunk in some ways. This last topic of the chapter works through those main concepts.\\nData and Voice VLAN Concepts\\nBefore    IP telephony, a PC could sit on the same desk as a phone. The phone happened to use UTP cabling, with that phone connected to some voice device (often called a   voice \\nswitch or a   private branch exchange [PBX]). The PC, of course, connected using an \\nunshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable to the usual LAN switch that sat in the wiring closet—sometimes in the same wiring closet as the voice switch. Figure 1-13 shows the idea.\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  35\\nTelephone UTP\\nEthernet UTPVoice\\nSwitchCloset\\nEthernetSwitch8VHU·V\\x03\\'HVN\\nFigure 1-13 Before IP Telephony: PC and Phone, One Cable Each, Connect to Two \\nDifferent Devices\\nThe term IP telephony refers to the branch of networking in which the tel ephones use \\nIP packets to send and receive voice as represented by the bits in the data portion of the IP \\npacket. The phones connect to the network like most other end-user devices, using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These new IP phones did not connect via cable directly to a voice switch, instead connecting to the IP network using an Ethernet cable and an Ethernet port built in to the phone. The phones then co mmunicated over the IP network with software that replaced \\nthe call setup and other functions of the PBX. (The current product from Cisco that perform this IP tel ephony control function is called   Cisco Unified Communications Manager .)\\nThe migration from using the already-installed telephone cabling, to these new IP phones that needed UTP cables that supported Ethernet, caused some problems in some offices. In particular:\\n■ The older non-IP phones used a category of UTP cabling that often did not support100-Mbps or 1000-Mbps Ethernet.\\n■ Most offices had a single UTP cable running from the wiring closet to each desk, butnow two devices (the PC and the new IP phone) both needed a cable from the desktopto the wiring closet.\\n■ Installing a new cable to every desk would be expensive, plus you would need moreswitch ports.\\nTo solve this problem, Cisco embedded small three-port switches into each phone. \\nIP telephones have included a small LAN switch, on the underside of the phone, since the \\nearliest IP telephone products. Figure 1-14 shows the basic cabling, with the wiring closet cable connecting to one physical port on the embedded switch, the PC connecting with a short patch cable to the other physical port, and the phone’s internal CPU connecting to an internal switch    port.\\nEthernet UTPWiring Closet\\nEthernet\\nSwitchPC Phone\\nPatch\\nCable8VHU·V\\x03\\'HVN\\nIP\\nEmbedded\\nSwitch\\nFigure 1-14 Cabling with an IP Phone, a Single Cable, and an Integrated Switch\\nptg1739636336  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSites that use IP telephony, which includes most every company today, now have two devic-\\nes off each access port. In addition, Cisco best practices for IP telephony design tell us to put the phones in one VLAN, and the PCs in a different VLAN. To make that happen, the switch port acts a little like an access link (for the PC’s traffic), and a little like a trunk (for the phone’s traffic). The configuration defines two VLANs on that port, as follows:\\nData VLAN: Same idea and configuration as the access VLAN on an access port, but defined as the VLAN on that link for forwarding the traffic for the device connected to the phone on the desk (typically the user’s PC).\\nVoice VLAN: The VLAN defined on the link for forwarding the phone’s traffic. Traffic \\nin this VLAN is typically tagged with an 802.1Q header.\\nFigure 1-15    illustrates this design with two VLANs on access ports that support IP telephones.\\nVLAN 11\\nVLAN 10IP\\nIP\\nIPIPVoice VLAN\\nData VLAN\\nFigure 1-15 A LAN Design, with Data in VLAN 10 and Phones in VLAN 11\\nData and Voice VLAN Configuration and Verification\\nConfiguring       a switch port to support IP phones, once you know the planned voice and data \\nVLAN IDs, is easy. Making sense of the show commands once they are configured can be a challenge. The port acts like an access port in many ways. However, with most configuration options, the voice frames flow with an 802.1Q header, so that the link supports frames in both VLANs on the link. But that makes for some different show command output.\\nExample 1-5 shows an example. In this case, all four switch ports F0/1–F0/4 begin with \\ndefault configuration. The configuration adds the new data and voice VLANs. The example then configures all four ports as access ports, and defines the access VLAN, which is also called the data VLAN when discussing IP telephony. Finally, the configuration includes the   switchport voice vlan 11 command, which defines the voice VLAN used on the port. The example matches Figure 1-15, using ports       F0/1–F0/4.\\nExample 1-5 Configuring the Voice and Data VLAN on Ports Connected to Phones\\nSW1# configure terminal \\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

CDP is enabled by default, so its configuration is not shown here.\\nThe following list details the configuration steps for easier review       and study: \\nStep 1. Use the   vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to create the data \\nand voice VLANs if they do not already exist on the switch. \\nStep 2. Configure the data VLAN like an access VLAN, as usual: \\nA. Use the   interface type number command in global configuration mode to \\nmove into interface configuration mode.\\nB. Use the   switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configu-\\nration mode to define the data VLAN.\\nC. Use the   switchport mode access command in interface configuration mode \\nto make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk).\\nStep 3. Use the   switchport voice vlan id-number command in interface configuration \\nmode to set the voice VLAN ID.\\nVerifying the status of a switch port configured like Example 1-5 shows some different output compared to the pure access port and pure trunk port configurations seen earlier in this chapter. For example, the   show interfaces switchport command shows details about \\nthe operation of an interface, including many details about access ports. Example 1-6 shows those details for port F0/4 after the configuration in Example 1-5 was       added.\\nExample 1-6 Verifying the Data VLAN (Access VLAN) and Voice VLAN\\nSW1# show interfaces FastEthernet 0/4 switchport \\nName: Fa0/4\\nSwitchport: Enabled\\nAdministrative Mode: static access\\nOperational Mode: static accessAdministrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q\\nOperational Trunking Encapsulation: native\\nNegotiation of Trunking: Off\\nAccess Mode VLAN: 10 (VLAN0010)Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)\\nAdministrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled\\nVoice VLAN: 11 (VLAN0011)\\n! The rest of the output is omitted for brevityConfig\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636338  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWorking through the first three highlighted lines in the output, all those details should look \\nfamiliar for any access port. The   switchport mode access configuration command statically \\nconfigures the administrative mode to be an access port, so the port of course operates as an access port. Also, as shown in the third highlighted line, the   switchport access vlan 10 \\nconfiguration command defined the access mode VLAN as highlighted here. \\nThe fourth highlighted line shows the one small new piece of information: the voice VLAN \\nID, as set with the   switchport voice vlan 11 command in this case. This small line of out-\\nput is the only piece of information in the output that differs from the earlier access port examples in this       chapter.\\nThese ports act more like access ports than trunk ports. In fact, the show interfaces \\ntype number switchport command boldly proclaims, “Operational Mode: static access.” \\nHowever, one other show command reveals just a little more about the underlying opera-tion with 802.1Q tagging for the voice frames.\\nAs mentioned earlier, the   show interfaces trunk command—that is, the command that does \\nnot include a specific interface in the middle of the command—lists the operational trunks \\non a switch. With IP telephony ports, the ports do not show up in the list of trunks either—providing evidence that these links are not treated as trunks. Example 1-7 shows just such an example.\\nHowever, the show interfaces trunk command with the interface listed in the middle of the \\ncommand, as is also shown in Example 1-7 , does list some additional information. Note that in this case, the show interfaces F0/4 trunk command lists the status as not-trunking, but with VLANs 10 and 11 allowed on the trunk. (Normally, on an access port, only the access VLAN is listed in the “VLANs allowed on the trunk” list in the output of this       command.)\\nExample 1-7 Allowed VLAN List and the List of Active VLANs\\nSW1# show interfaces trunk     \\nSW1# show interfaces F0/4 trunk\\nPort Mode Encapsulation  Status Native vlan\\nFa0/4 off 802.1q not-trunking  1\\nPort Vlans allowed on trunk\\nFa0/4 10-11\\nPort Vlans allowed and active in management domain\\nFa0/4 10-11\\nPort Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned\\nFa0/4 10-11\\nSummary: IP Telephony Ports on Switches\\nIt might    seem like this short topic about IP telephony and switch configuration includes a \\nlot of small twists and turns and trivia, and it does. The most important items to remember are as follow:\\nptg173963631Chapter 1: Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs  39\\n■ Configure these ports like a normal access port to begin: Configure it as a static access\\nport and assign it an access VLAN.\\n■ Add one more command to define the voice VLAN (switchport voice vlan vlan-id).\\n■ Look for the mention of the voice VLAN ID, but no other new facts, in the output ofthe show interfaces type number switchport command.\\n■ Look for both the voice and data (access) VLAN IDs in the output of the show\\ninterfaces type number trunk command.\\n■ Do not expect to see the port listed in the list of operational trunks as listed by the show\\ninterfaces trunk command   .\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Using redundant links in a LAN design allows the LAN to keep work-ing even when some links fail or even when some entire switches fail. Proper LAN design should add enough redundancy       so that no single point of failure crashes the LAN; STP allows the design to use redundancy without causing some other problems.\\nSTP affects many aspects of how switch forwarding logic works. Because Cisco puts the \\nSTP exam topics into the ICND2 half of the CCNA Routing and Switching exam, all the detailed examples in the ICND1 Cert Guide avoid showing redundant links in the LANs. For this ICND2 book, most of the LAN examples include redundancy. Therefore, you need to be prepared to rethink what you learned about LANs from reading the ICND1 book while thinking about LANs that have redundant links, and how STP and related features make those LANs work.\\nThis chapter organizes the material into three sections. The first section presents core STP \\nconcepts that apply to most types of STP. STP has been improved and changed over the years, with Rapid STP (RSTP) being one major improvement. The first section looks at STP concepts without the RSTP logic added, while the second major section details RSTP con-cepts. The final major section discusses a small number of features that optimize and secure STP: PortFast, BPDU Guard, and EtherChannels.\\nAs for the exam topics for this chapter, note that they all use the same three verbs: config-\\nure, verify, and troubleshoot. This chapter does not get into that level of depth on any of \\nthe specific topics, but instead lays the foundation to understand these features so that you \\nptg17396363are prepared to delve into the configuration, verification, and troubleshooting details in \\nChapters 3 and 4.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

PortFast\\nFoundation Topics\\nSpanning Tree Protocol (IEEE 802.1D)\\nWithout Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), a LAN with redundant links would cause Ethernet \\nframes to loop for an indefinite period of time. With STP enabled, some switches block ports so that these ports do not forward frames. STP intelligently     chooses which ports block, with two goals in mind:\\n■All devices in a VLAN can send frames to all other devices. In other words, STP does not\\nblock too many ports, cutting off some parts of the LAN from other parts.\\n■Frames have a short life and do not loop around the network indefinitely.\\nSTP strikes a balance, allowing frames to be delivered to each device, without causing the problems that occur when frames loop through the network over and over again.\\nSTP prevents looping frames     by adding an additional check on each interface before a \\nswitch uses it to send or receive user traffic. That check: If the port is in STP forwarding state in that VLAN, use it as normal; if it is in STP blocking state, however, block all user traffic and do not send or receive user traffic on that interface in that VLAN.\\nNote that these STP states do not change the other information you already know about \\nswitch interfaces. The interface’s state of connected/notconnect does not change. The interface’s operational state as either an access or trunk port does not change. STP adds this additional STP state, with the blocking state basically disabling the interface.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  45\\nIn many ways, those last two paragraphs sum up what STP does. However, the details of \\nhow STP does its work can take a fair amount of study and practice. This first major section of the chapter begins by explaining the need for STP and the basic ideas of what STP does to solve the problem of looping frames. The majority of this section then looks at how STP goes about choosing which switch ports to block to accomplish STP’s goals.\\nThe Need for Spanning Tree\\nSTP prevents three common problems in Ethernet LANs. All three problems occur as a side effect of one fact: without STP, some Ethernet frames would loop around the network for a long time (hours, days, literally forever if the LAN devices and links never failed). By default, Cisco switches run STP, but you can     disable STP. Do not disable it unless you know exactly what you are doing!\\nJust one looping frame causes what is called a   \\nbroadcast storm . Broadcast storms hap-\\npen when any kind of Ethernet frames—broadcast frames, multicast frames, or unknown-\\ndestination unicast frames—loop around a LAN indefinitely. Broadcast storms can saturate all the links with copies of that one single frame, crowding out good frames, as well as significantly impacting end-user device performance by making the PCs process too many broadcast frames.\\nTo help you understand how this occurs, Figure 2-1 shows a sample network in which Bob \\nsends a broadcast frame. The dashed lines show how the switches forward the frame when STP does not exist.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 Gi0/1\\nGi0/2\\nFa0/13\\n0200.3333.3333BobLarry\\nFa0/11 Fa0/12\\nSW2\\nSW3SW1Archie\\nFigure 2-1 Broadcast Storm\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A, B 2 C, D 3 C 4 B 5 B, D 6 A, D 7 D\\nptg1739636346  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE Bob’s original broadcast would also be forwarded around the other direction as \\nwell, with SW3 sending a copy of the original frame out its Gi0/1 port. To reduce clutter, Figure 2-1 does not show that frame.\\nRemember that LAN switch? That logic tells switches to flood broadcasts out all interfaces in the same VLAN except the interface in which the frame arrived. In Figure 2-1, that means SW3 forwards Bob’s frame to SW2, SW2 forwards the frame to SW1, SW1 forwards the frame back to SW3, and SW3 forwards it back to SW2 again.\\nWhen broadcast storms happen, frames like the one in Figure 2-1 keep looping until some-\\nthing changes—someone shuts down an interface, reloads a switch, or does something else to break the loop. Also note that the same event happens in the opposite direction. When Bob sends the original frame, SW3 also forwards a copy to SW1, SW1 forwards it to SW2, and so on.\\nThe storm also causes a much more subtle problem called \\nMAC table instability . MAC \\ntable instability means that the switches’ MAC address tables keep changing, because frames \\nwith the same source MAC arrive on different ports. To see why, follow this example, in which SW3 begins Figure 2-1 with a MAC table entry for Bob, at the bottom of the figure, associated with port Fa0/13: \\n0200.3333.3333    Fa0/13   VLAN 1\\nHowever, now think about the switch-learning process that occurs when the looping frame goes to SW2, then SW1, and then back into SW3’s Gi0/1 interface. SW3 thinks, “Hmm… the source MAC address is 0200.3333.3333, and it came in my Gi0/1 interface. Update my MAC table!” This results in the following entry on SW3, with interface Gi0/1 instead of Fa0/13:\\n0200.3333.3333    Gi0/1   VLAN 1\\nAt this point, SW3 itself cannot correctly deliver frames to Bob’s MAC address. At that instant, if a frame arrives at SW3 destined for Bob—a different frame than the looping frame that causes the problems—SW3 incorrectly forwards the frame out Gi0/1 to SW1, creating even more congestion.\\nThe looping frames in a broadcast storm also cause a third problem: multiple copies of the \\nframe arrive at the destination. Consider a case in which Bob sends a frame to Larry but none of the switches know Larry’s MAC address. Switches flood frames sent to unknown destination unicast MAC addresses. When Bob sends the frame destined for Larry’s MAC address, SW3 sends a copy to both SW1 and SW2. SW1 and SW2 also flood the frame, causing copies of the frame to loop. SW1 also sends a copy of each frame out Fa0/11 to Larry. As a result, Larry gets multiple copies of the frame, which may result in an applica-tion failure, if not more pervasive networking problems.\\nTable 2-2 summarizes the main three classes of problems     that occur when STP is not used in \\na LAN that has redundancy.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  47\\nTable 2-2 Three Classes of Problems Caused by Not Using STP in Redundant LANs\\nProblem Description\\nBroadcast storms The forwarding of a frame repeatedly on the same links, consuming \\nsignificant parts of the links’ capacities  \\nMAC table instability The continual updating of a switch’s MAC address table with \\nincorrect entries, in reaction to looping frames, resulting in frames \\nbeing sent to the wrong locations \\nMultiple frame transmissionA side effect of looping frames in which multiple c opies of one \\nframe are delivered to the intended host, confusing the host  \\nWhat IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Does\\nSTP prevents loops by placing each switch port in either a forwarding state or a blocking \\nstate. Interfaces      in the forwarding state act as normal, forwarding and receiving frames. However, interfaces in a blocking state do not process any frames except STP messages (and some other overhead messages). Interfaces that block do not forward user frames, do not learn MAC addresses of received frames, and   do not process received user frames.\\nFigure 2-2 shows a simple STP tree that solves the problem shown in Figure 2-1 by placing \\none port on SW3 in the blocking state.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 Gi0/1\\nGi0/2\\nFa0/13\\n0200.3333.3333BobLarry\\nFa0/11 Fa0/12\\nSW2\\nSW3SW1Archie\\n123 3\\n4\\n54\\nBLOCK\\nFigure 2-2 What STP Does: Blocks a Port to Break the Loop\\nNow when Bob sends a broadcast frame, the frame does not loop. As shown in the steps in the figure:\\nStep 1. Bob sends the frame to SW3.\\nStep 2. SW3 forwards the frame only to SW1, but not out Gi0/2 to SW2, because \\nSW3’s Gi0/2 interface is in a blocking state.\\nStep 3. SW1 floods the frame out both Fa0/11 and Gi0/1.Step 4. SW2 floods the frame out Fa0/12 and Gi0/1.\\nptg1739636348  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStep 5. SW3 physically receives the frame, but it ignores the frame received from SW2 \\nbecause SW3’s Gi0/2 interface is in a blocking state.\\nWith the STP topology in Figure 2-2, the switches simply do not use the link between SW2 \\nand SW3 for traffic in this VLAN, which is the minor negative side effect of STP. However, if either of the other two links fails, STP converges   so that SW3 forwards instead of blocks on its Gi0/2 interface.\\nNOTE The term \\nSTP convergence  refers    to the process by which the switches collec-\\ntively realize that something has changed in the LAN topology and determine whether they need to change which ports block and which ports forward.\\nThat completes the description of what STP does, placing each port into either a forwarding or blocking state. The more interesting question, and the one that takes a lot more work to understand, is the question of how and why STP makes its choices. How does STP manage to make switches block or forward on each interface? And how does it converge to change state from blocking to forwarding to take advantage of redundant links in response to net-work outages? The following sections answer these questions.\\nHow Spanning Tree Works\\nThe STP algorithm creates a spanning tree of interfaces that forward frames. The tree struc-ture of forwarding interfaces creates a single path to and from each Ethernet link, just like you can trace a single path in a living, growing tree from the base of the tree to each leaf.\\nNOTE STP was created before LAN switches even existed. In those days, Ethernet bridges used STP. Today, switches play the same role as bridges, implementing STP. However, many STP terms still refer to bridge. For the  purposes of STP and this chapter, consider the terms \\nbridge  and switch  synonymous.\\nThe process used by STP, sometimes      called the spanning-tree algorithm  (STA), chooses \\nthe interfaces that should be placed into a forwarding state. For any interfaces not chosen to be in a forwarding state, STP places the interfaces in blocking state. In other words, STP simply picks which interfaces should forward, and any interfaces left over go to a blocking state.\\nSTP uses three criteria to choose        whether to put an interface in forwarding state:\\n■STP elects a root switch. STP puts all working interfaces on the root switch in forwarding\\nstate.\\n■Each nonroot switch considers one of its ports to have the least administrative cost\\nbetween itself and the root switch. The cost is called that    switch’s root cost. STP places\\nits port that is part of the least root cost path, called that switch’s   root port (RP), in for-\\nwarding state.\\n■Many switches can attach to the same Ethernet segment, but in modern networks, nor-\\nmally two switches connect to each link. The switch with the lowest root cost, as com-\\npared with the other switches attached to the same link, is placed in forwarding state.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  49\\nThat switch is the designated switch, and that switch’s interface, attached to that seg-\\nment, is called the    designated port (DP).\\nNOTE The real reason the root switches place all working interfaces in a forwarding state \\nis that all its interfaces will become DPs, but it is easier to just remember that all the root switches’ working interfaces will forward frames.\\nAll other interfaces are placed   in blocking state. Table 2-3 summarizes the reasons STP places a port in forwarding or blocking state.\\nTable 2-3 STP: Reasons for Forwarding or Blocking\\nCharacterization of Port STP State Description\\nAll the root switch’s ports Forwarding The root switch is always the designated switch on \\nall connected segments.\\nEach nonroot switch’s root \\nportForwarding The port through which the switch has the least \\ncost to reach the root switch (lowest root cost).\\nEach LAN’s designated portForwarding The switch forwarding the Hello on to the \\nsegment, with the lowest root cost, is the designated switch for that segment.\\nAll other working ports Blocking The port is not used for forwarding user frames, \\nnor are any frames received on these interfaces considered for forwarding.         \\nNOTE STP only considers   working interfaces (those in a connected state). Failed interfaces     \\n(for example, interfaces with no cable installed) or administratively shutdown interfaces are instead placed into an STP disabled state. So, this section uses the term \\nworking ports  to \\nrefer to interfaces that could forward frames if STP placed the interface into a forwarding state.\\nThe STP Bridge ID and Hello BPDU\\nThe STA begins with an election of one switch to be the root switch. To better understand this election process, you need to understand the STP messages sent between switches as well as the concept and format of the identifier used to uniquely identify each switch.\\nThe STP \\nbridge ID  (BID) is      an 8-byte value unique to each switch. The bridge ID consists \\nof a 2-byte priority field and a 6-byte system ID, with the system ID being based on a uni-\\nversal (burned-in) MAC address in each switch. Using a burned-in MAC address    ensures that each switch’s bridge ID will be unique.\\nSTP defines messages        called \\nbridge protocol data units  (BPDU), which switches use to \\nexchange information with each other. The most common BPDU, called a Hello BPDU, lists \\nmany details, including the sending switch’s BID. By listing its own unique BID, switches can tell which switch sent which Hello BPDU. Table 2-4 lists some of the key information in the Hello BPDU.\\nptg1739636350  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 2-4 Fields in the STP Hello BPDU\\nField Description\\nRoot bridge ID The bridge ID of the switch the sender of this Hello \\ncurrently believes to be the root switch \\nSender’s bridge ID The bridge ID of the switch sending this Hello BPDU \\nSender’s root cost The STP cost between this switch and the current root \\nTimer values on the root switch Includes the Hello timer, MaxAge timer, and forward delay \\ntimer\\nFor the time being, just keep the first three items from Table 2-4 in mind as the following \\nsections work through the three steps in how STP chooses the interfaces to place into a for-warding state. Next, the text examines the three main steps in the STP process.\\nElecting the Root Switch\\nSwitches elect a root switch based       on the BIDs in the BPDUs. The root switch is the switch with the lowest numeric value for the BID. Because the two-part BID starts with the prior-ity value, essentially the switch with the lowest priority becomes the root. For example, if one switch has priority 4096, and another switch has priority 8192, the switch with priority 4096 wins, regardless of what MAC address was used to create the BID for each switch.\\nIf a tie occurs based on the priority portion of the BID, the switch with the lowest MAC \\naddress portion of the BID is the root. No other tiebreaker should be needed because switches use one of their own universal (burned-in) MAC addresses as the second part of their BIDs. So if the priorities tie, and one switch uses a MAC address of 0200.0000.0000 as part of the BID and the other uses 0911.1111.1111, the first switch (MAC 0200.0000.0000) becomes the root switch.\\nSTP elects a root switch in a manner not unlike a political election. The process begins \\nwith all switches claiming to be the root by sending Hello BPDUs listing their own BID as the root BID. If a switch hears a Hello that lists a better (lower) BID, that switch stops advertising itself as root and starts forwarding the superior Hello. The Hello sent by the better switch lists the better switch’s BID as the root. It works like a political race in which a less-popular candidate gives up and leaves the race, throwing his support behind the more popular candidate. Eventually, everyone agrees which switch has the best (lowest) BID, and everyone supports the elected switch—which is where the political race analogy falls apart.\\nNOTE A better Hello, meaning that the listed root’s BID is better (numerically lower), is called a  \\nsuperior Hello ; a worse Hello, meaning that the listed root’s BID is not as good \\n(numerically higher), is called an  inferior Hello .\\nFigure 2-3 shows the beginning of the root election process. In this case, SW1 has adver-tised itself as root, as have SW2 and SW3. However, SW2 now believes that SW1 is a better root, so SW2 is now forwarding the Hello originating at SW1. So, at this point, the figure shows SW1 is saying Hello, claiming to be root; SW2 agrees, and is forwarding SW1’s Hello that lists SW1 as root; but, SW3 is still claiming to be best, sending       its own Hello BPDUs, listing SW3’s BID as the root.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  51\\nGi0/2Root Cost: 0\\nMy BID:    32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001\\nRoot Cost: 0My BID:    32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root Cost: 4My BID:     32,769: 0200.0002.0002Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001\\nRoot Cost: 0My BID:    32,769: 0200.0003.0003Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0003.0003Root Cost: 0My BID:    32,769: 0200.0003.0003Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0003.0003Gi0/1Gi0/1Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1\\nFigure 2-3 Beginnings of the Root Election Process\\nTwo candidates still exist in Figure 2-3: SW1 and SW3. So who wins? Well, from the BID, \\nthe lower-priority switch wins; if a tie occurs, the lower MAC address wins. As shown in the figure, SW1 has a lower BID (32769:0200.0001.0001) than SW3 (32769:0200.0003.0003), so SW1 wins, and SW3 now also believes that SW1 is the better switch. Figure 2-4 shows the resulting Hello messages sent by the switches.\\nGi0/2Root Cost: 0\\nMy BID:    32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001\\nRoot Cost: 0My BID:    32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001Root Cost: 4My BID:    32,769: 0200.0002.0002Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001\\nRoot Cost: 5My BID:    32,769: 0200.0003.0003Root BID: 32,769: 0200.0001.0001Gi0/1Gi0/1Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW11\\n1\\n22\\nFigure 2-4 SW1 Wins the Election\\nAfter the election is complete, only the root switch continues to originate STP Hello BPDU \\nmessages. The other switches receive the Hellos, update the sender’s BID field (and root cost field), and forward the Hellos out other interfaces. The figure reflects this fact, with SW1 sending Hellos at Step 1, and SW2 and SW3 independently forwarding the Hello out their other interfaces at Step 2.\\nptg1739636352  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSummarizing, the root election happens through each switch claiming to be root, with the \\nbest switch being elected based on the numerically lowest BID. Breaking down the BID into its components, the comparisons can       be made as\\n■The lowest priority\\n■If that ties, the lowest switch MAC address\\nChoosing Each Switch’s Root Port\\nThe second part of the STP process occurs when each nonroot switch chooses its one and only \\nroot port . A switch’s RP        is its interface through which it has the least STP cost to \\nreach the root switch (least root cost).\\nThe idea of a switch’s cost to reach the root switch can be easily seen for humans. Just look \\nat a network diagram that shows the root switch, lists the STP cost associated with each switch port, and identifies the nonroot switch in question. Switches use a different process than looking at a network diagram, of course, but using a diagram can make it easier to learn the idea.\\nFigure 2-5 shows just such a figure, with the same three switches shown in the last several \\nfigures. SW1 has already won the election as root, and the figure considers the cost from SW3’s perspective.\\nGi0/1Total\\nCost = 8TotalCost = 5\\nGi0/2Gi0/2SW2\\nSW3SW1\\nCost 4Cost 4\\nCost 5Root\\nFigure 2-5 How a Human Might Calculate STP Cost from SW3 to the Root (SW1)\\nSW3 has two possible physical paths to send frames to the root switch: the direct path to \\nthe left, and the indirect path to the right through switch SW2. The cost is the sum of the costs of all the \\nswitch ports the frame would exit  if it flowed over that path. (The calcu-\\nlation ignores the inbound ports.) As you can see, the cost over the direct path out SW3’s G0/1 port has a total cost of 5, and the other path has a total cost of 8. SW3 picks its G0/1 port as root port because it is the port that is part of the least-cost path to send frames to the root switch.\\nSwitches come to the same conclusion, but using a different process. Instead, they add \\ntheir local interface STP cost to the root cost listed in each received Hello BPDU. The STP \\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  53\\nport cost is simply an     integer value assigned to each interface, per VLAN, for the purpose \\nof providing an objective measurement that allows STP to choose which interfaces to add to the STP topology. The switches also look at their neighbor’s root cost, as       announced in Hello BPDUs received from each neighbor.\\nFigure 2-6 shows an example of how switches calculate their best root cost and then choose \\ntheir root port, using the same topology and STP costs as shown in Figure 2-5. STP on SW3 calculates its cost to reach the root over the two possible paths by adding the advertised cost (in Hello messages) to the interface costs listed in the figure.\\nFocus on the process for a moment. The root switch sends Hellos, with a listed root cost of \\n0. The idea is that the root’s cost to reach itself is 0.\\nNext, look on the left of the figure. SW3 takes the received cost (0) from the Hello sent by \\nSW1, and adds the interface cost (5) of the interface on which that Hello was received. SW3 calculates that the cost to reach the root switch, out that port (G0/1), is 5.\\nOn the right side, SW2 has realized its best cost to reach the root is cost 4. So, when SW2 \\nforwards the Hello toward SW3, SW2 lists a root cost 4. SW3’s STP port cost on port G0/2 is 4, so SW3 determines a total cost to reach root out its G0/2 port of 8.\\nAs a result of the process depicted in Figure 2-6, SW3 chooses Gi0/1 as its RP, because the \\ncost to reach the root switch through that port (5) is lower than the other alternative (Gi0/2, cost 8). Similarly, SW2 chooses Gi0/2 as its RP, with a cost of 4 (SW1’s advertised cost of 0 plus SW2’s Gi0/2 interface cost of 4). Each switch places its root port into a forwarding state.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 SW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW10 + 4 = 4\\n0 + 5 = 54 + 4 = 8\\nCost = 4Cost = 4\\nCost = 5My Root Cost \\nOut G0/2 is 4\\nRoot Cost out G0/1 is 5\\nRoot Cost out G0/2 is 8Root Cost = 0Root Cost = 4Root Cost = 0\\nRootHello\\nHelloHello\\nInterface\\nInterfaceInterface\\nFigure 2-6 How STP Actually Calculates the Cost from SW3 to the Root\\nIn more complex topologies, the choice of root port will not be so obvious. Chapter 4, \\n“LAN Troubleshooting,” discusses these more complex       examples, including the tiebreakers to use if the root costs tie.\\nptg1739636354  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChoosing the Designated Port on Each LAN Segment\\nSTP’s final step to choose the STP topology is to choose the designated port on each LAN \\nsegment. The        designated port (DP) on each LAN segment is the switch port that advertises the lowest-cost Hello onto a LAN segment. When a nonroot switch forwards a Hello, the nonroot switch sets the root cost field in the Hello to that switch’s cost to reach the root. In effect, the switch with the lower cost to reach the root, among all switches connected to a segment, becomes the DP on that segment.\\nFor example, earlier Figure 2-4 shows in bold text the parts of the Hello messages from \\nboth SW2 and SW3 that determine the choice of DP on that segment. Note that both SW2 and SW3 list their respective cost to reach the root switch (cost 4 on SW2 and cost 5 on SW3). SW2 lists the lower cost, so SW2’s Gi0/1 port is the designated port on that LAN segment.\\nAll DPs are placed into a forwarding state; so in this case, SW2’s Gi0/1 interface will be in a \\nforwarding state.\\nIf the advertised costs tie, the switches break the tie by choosing the switch with the lower \\nBID. In this case, SW2 would also have won, with a BID of 32769:0200.0002.0002 versus SW3’s 32769:0200.0003.0003.\\nNOTE Two additional tiebreakers are needed in some cases, although these would be unlikely today. A single switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain by connecting to a hub. In that case, the one switch hears its own BPDUs. So, if a switch ties with itself, two additional tiebreakers are used: the lowest interface STP priority and, if that ties, the lowest internal interface number.\\nThe only interface that does not have a reason to be in a forwarding state on the three switch-es in the examples shown in Figures 2-3 through 2-6 is SW3’s Gi0/2 port. So, the STP process is now complete. Table 2-5 outlines the        state of each port and shows why it is in that state.\\nTable 2-5 State of Each Interface\\nSwitch Interface State Reason Why the Interface Is in Forwarding State\\nSW1, Gi0/1 Forwarding The interface is on the root switch, so it becomes the DP \\non that link.\\nSW1, Gi0/2 Forwarding The interface is on the root switch, so it becomes the DP \\non that link.\\nSW2, Gi0/2 Forwarding The root port of SW2.\\nSW2, Gi0/1 Forwarding The designated port on the LAN segment to SW3.SW3, Gi0/1 Forwarding The root port of SW3.SW3, Gi0/2 Blocking Not the root port and not the designated port.\\nInfluencing and Changing the STP Topology\\nSwitches do not just use STP once and never again. The switches continually watch for \\nchanges. Those changes can be because a link or switch fails or it can be a new link that can now be used. The configuration can change in a way that changes the STP topology. This section briefly discusses the kinds of things that change the STP topology, either through configuration or through changes in the status of devices and links in the LAN.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  55\\nMaking Configuration Changes to Influence the STP Topology\\nThe network engineers can      choose to change the STP settings to then change the choices \\nSTP makes in a given LAN. Two main tools available to the engineer are to configure the bridge ID and to change STP port costs.\\nSwitches have a way to create a default BID, by taking a default priority value, and adding \\na universal MAC address that comes with the switch hardware. However, engineers typi-cally want to choose which switch becomes the root. Chapter 3, “Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation,” shows how to configure a Cisco switch to override its default BID setting to make a switch become root.\\nPort costs also have default values, per port, per VLAN. You can configure these port costs, or \\nyou can use the default values. Table 2-6 lists the   default port costs suggested by IEEE. IOS on Cisco switches has long used the default settings as defined in the 1998 version of the 802.1D standard. The newer standard, useful when using links faster than 10 Gbps, can be used by add-ing a single configuration command to each   switch (\\nspanning-tree pathcost method long ). \\nTable 2-6 Default Port Costs According to IEEE\\nEthernet Speed IEEE Cost: 1998 (and Before) IEEE Cost: 2004 (and After)\\n10 Mbps 100 2,000,000\\n100 Mbps 19 200,000\\n1 Gbps 4 20,000\\n10 Gbps 2 2000\\n100 Gbps N/A 200\\n1 Tbps N/A 20\\nWith STP enabled, all working switch interfaces will settle into an STP forwarding or block-ing state, even access ports. For switch interfaces connected to hosts or routers, which do not use STP, the switch still forwards Hellos on to those interfaces. By virtue of being the only device sending a Hello onto that LAN segment, the switch is sending the least-cost Hello on to that LAN segment, making the switch become the designated port on that LAN segment. So, STP puts working access interfaces into a forwarding      state as a result of the designated port part of the STP process.\\nReacting to State Changes That Affect the STP Topology\\nOnce the engineer has finished all STP configuration, the STP topology should settle into a stable state and not change, at least until the      network topology changes. This section exam-ines the ongoing operation of STP while the network is stable, and then it covers how STP converges to a new topology when something changes.\\nThe root switch sends a new Hello BPDU every 2 seconds by default. Each nonroot switch \\nforwards the Hello on all DPs, but only after changing items listed in the Hello. The switch sets the root cost to that local switch’s calculated root cost. The switch also sets the “send-er’s bridge ID” field to its own bridge ID. (The root’s bridge ID field is not changed.)\\nptg1739636356  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nBy forwarding the received (and changed) Hellos out all DPs, all switches continue to \\nreceive Hellos every 2 seconds. The following steps summarize the    steady-state operation when nothing is currently changing in the STP topology:\\nStep 1. The root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a root cost of 0, out all its \\nworking interfaces (those in a forwarding state).\\nStep 2. The nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports. After changing the \\nHello to list their own BID as the sender’s BID, and listing that switch’s root \\ncost, the switch forwards the Hello out all designated ports.\\nStep 3. Steps 1 and 2 repeat until something changes.\\nEach switch relies on these periodically received Hellos from the root as a way to know that \\nits path to the root is still working. When a switch ceases to receive the Hellos, or receives a Hello that lists different details, something has failed, so the      switch reacts and starts the process of changing the spanning-tree topology.\\nHow Switches React to Changes with STP\\nFor various reasons, the convergence process requires the use of three timers. Note that all switches use the timers as dictated by the root switch, which the root lists in its periodic Hello BPDU messages. Table 2-7 describes      the timers.\\nTable 2-7 STP Timers\\nTimer Default Value Description\\nHello 2 seconds The time period between Hellos created by the root. \\nMaxAge 10 times Hello How long any switch should wait, after ceasing to hear Hellos, \\nbefore trying to change the STP topology. \\nForward \\ndelay15 seconds Delay that affects the process that occurs  when an interface \\nchanges from blocking state to forwarding state. A port stays in an interim listening state, and then an interim learning state, for the number of seconds defined by the forward delay timer.\\nIf a switch does not get an expected Hello BPDU within the Hello time, the switch contin-\\nues as normal. However, if the Hellos do not show up again within MaxAge time, the switch reacts by taking steps to change the STP topology. With default settings, MaxAge is 20 seconds (10 times the default Hello timer of 2 seconds). So, a switch would go 20 seconds without hearing a Hello before reacting.\\nAfter MaxAge expires, the switch essentially makes all its STP choices again, based on \\nany Hellos it receives from other switches. It reevaluates which switch should be the root switch. If the local switch is not the root, it chooses its RP. And it determines whether it is DP on each of its other links. The best way to describe STP convergence is to show an example using the same familiar topology. Figure 2-7 shows the same familiar figure, with SW3’s Gi0/2 in a blocking state, but SW1’s Gi0/2 interface has just      failed.\\nSW3 reacts to the change because SW3 fails to receive its expected Hellos on its Gi0/1 \\ninterface. However, SW2 does not need to react because SW2 continues to receive its peri-odic Hellos in its Gi0/2 interface. In this case, SW3 reacts either when MaxAge time passes without hearing the Hellos, or as soon as SW3 notices that interface Gi0/1 has failed. (If the interface fails, the switch can assume that the Hellos will not be arriving in that interface anymore.)\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  57\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 Gi0/1\\nGi0/2\\nFa0/13\\nBobLarry\\nFa0/11 Fa0/12Archie\\nSW1\\nSW3SW2\\nLegend:\\n– Root Port\\n– Designated Port– Blocking Port– Failing LinkDP\\nDPDP\\nDP DP\\nDPRP DP\\nRoot is    SW1\\nI am         SW1Root Cost = 0Root is    SW1I am         SW2Root Cost = 4Root is    SW1I am         SW1Root Cost = 0\\nRoot\\nRP\\nRPHello\\nHelloHello\\nFigure 2-7 Initial STP State Before SW1-SW3 Link Fails\\nNow that SW3 can act, it begins by reevaluating the choice of root switch. SW3 still \\nreceives the Hellos from SW2, as forwarded from the root (SW1). SW1 still has a lower BID than SW3; otherwise, SW1 would not have already been the root. So, SW3 decides that SW1 is still the best switch and that SW3 is not the root.\\nNext, SW3 reevaluates its choice of RP. At this point, SW3 is receiving Hellos on only one \\ninterface: Gi0/2. Whatever the calculated root cost, Gi0/2 becomes SW3’s new RP. (The cost would be 8, assuming the STP costs had no changes since Figures 2-5 and 2-6.)\\nSW3 then reevaluates its role as DP on any other interfaces. In this example, no real work \\nneeds to be done. SW3 was already DP on interface Fa0/13, and it      continues to be the DP because no other switches connect to that port.\\nChanging Interface States with STP\\nSTP uses the idea of roles and states. Roles , like    root port and designated port, relate to \\nhow STP analyzes the LAN topology. States , like    forwarding and blocking, tell a switch \\nwhether to send or receive frames. When STP converges, a switch chooses new port roles, and the port roles determine the state (forwarding or blocking).\\nSwitches can simply     move immediately from forwarding to blocking state, but they must \\ntake extra time to transition from blocking state to forwarding state. For instance, when a switch formerly used port G0/1 as its RP (a role), that port was in a forwarding state. After convergence, G0/1 might be neither an RP nor DP; the switch can immediately move that port to a blocking state.\\nptg1739636358  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhen a port that formerly blocked needs to transition to forwarding, the switch first puts \\nthe port through two intermediate interface states. These temporary states help prevent temporary loops:\\n■Listening: Like the blocking state, the interface    does not forward frames. The switch\\nremoves old stale (unused) MAC table entries for which no frames are received fromeach MAC address during this period. These stale MAC table entries could be the causeof the temporary loops.\\n■Learning: Interfaces in this state still do not    forward frames, but the switch begins tolearn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface.\\nSTP moves an interface from blocking to listening, then to learning, and then to forwarding \\nstate. STP leaves the interface in each interim state for a time equal to the forward delay timer, which defaults to 15 seconds. As a result, a convergence event that causes an inter-face to change from blocking to forwarding requires 30 seconds to transition from blocking to forwarding. In addition, a switch might have to wait MaxAge seconds before even choos-ing to move an interface from blocking to forwarding state.\\nFor example, follow what happens with an initial STP topology as shown in Figures 2-3 \\nthrough 2-6, with the SW1-to-SW3 link failing as shown in Figure 2-7. If SW1 simply quit sending Hello messages to SW3, but the link between the two did not fail, SW3 would wait MaxAge seconds before reacting (20 seconds is the default). SW3 would actually quickly choose its ports’ STP roles, but then wait 15 seconds each in listening     and learning states on interface Gi0/2, resulting in a 50-second convergence delay.\\nTable 2-8 summarizes spanning tree’s various      interface states for easier review.\\nTable 2-8 IEEE 802.1D Spanning-Tree States\\nState Forwards Data \\nFrames?Learns MACs Based on Received Frames?Transitory or Stable State?\\nBlocking No No Stable\\nListening No No Transitory\\nLearning No Y es Transitory\\nForwarding Y es Y es Stable\\nDisabled No No Stable\\nRapid STP (IEEE 802.1w) Concepts\\nThe original STP worked well given the assumptions about networks and networking devic-\\nes in that era. However, as with any computing or networking standard, as time passes, hard-ware and software capabilities improve, so new protocols emerge to take advantage of those new capabilities. For STP, one of the most significant improvements over time has been the introduction      of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), introduced as standard IEEE 802.1w.\\nBefore getting into the details of RSTP, it helps to make sense of the standards numbers a \\nbit. 802.1w was actually an amendment to the 802.1D standard. 802.1D            was published anew in 1998 (and a few times before that). After the 1998 version of 802.1D, the IEEE published the 802.1w amendment in 2001. Later, when the IEEE 802.1 committee updated the 802.1D standard in 2004, the IEEE pulled the 802.1w amendment details into the 802.1D-2004 standard. \\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  59\\nSo, why do we care? Sometimes people use the term STP to refer to the original pre-RSTP \\nrules for STP. Some use STP to mean anything in the 802.1D standard, which now includes RSTP. So for real life, make sure you know what people mean when they use STP: do they mean STP to include RSTP concepts, or not? For this book, throughout the book, if the distinction between STP and RSTP matters, the book will use STP for the original STP rules and RSTP for the new ones introduced by 802.1w.\\nNOTE The IEEE sells its standards, but through the   “Get IEEE 802” program, you can get free PDFs of the current 802 standards. To read about RSTP 802.1w, you will need to download the 802.1D standard, and then look for the sections about RSTP. \\nNow on to the details about RSTP in this chapter. There are similarities between RSTP and STP, so this section next compares and contrasts the two. Following that, the rest of this section discusses the concepts unique to RSTP that are not found in STP: alternate root ports, different port states, backup ports, and the port     roles used by RSTP.\\nComparing STP and RSTP\\nRSTP (802.1w) works     just like STP (the original 802.1D) in several ways:\\n■It elects the root switch using the same parameters and tiebreakers.\\n■It elects the root port on nonroot switches with the same rules.\\n■It elects designated ports on each LAN segment with the same rules.\\n■It places each port in either forwarding or blocking state, although RSTP calls the block-\\ning state the discarding state.\\nIn fact, RSTP works so much like STP that they can both be used in the same network. RSTP and STP switches can be deployed in the same network, with RSTP features working in switches that support it, and traditional 802.1D STP features working in the switches that support only STP.\\nWith all these similarities, you might be wondering why the IEEE bothered to create RSTP \\nin the first place. The overriding reason is convergence. STP takes a relatively long time to converge (50 seconds with the default settings when all the wait times must be followed). RSTP improves network convergence when topology changes occur, usually converging within a few seconds (or in slow conditions, in about 10 seconds).\\nIEEE 802.1w RSTP changes and adds to IEEE 802.1D STP in ways that avoid waiting on \\nSTP timers, resulting in quick transitions from forwarding to blocking state and vice versa. Specifically, RSTP, compared to STP, defines more cases in which the switch can avoid wait-ing for a timer to expire, such as the following:\\n■Adds a new mechanism to replace the root port, without any waiting to reach a forward-\\ning state (in some conditions)\\n■Adds a new mechanism to replace a designated port, without any waiting to reach a for-\\nwarding state (in some conditions)\\n■Lowers waiting times for cases in which RSTP must wait\\nFor instance, when a link remains up, but Hello BPDUs simply stop arriving regularly on a port, STP requires a switch to wait for MaxAge seconds. STP defines the MaxAge timers \\nptg1739636360  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nbased on ten times the Hello timer, or 20 seconds, by default. RSTP     shortens this timer, \\ndefining MaxAge as three times the Hello timer.\\nThe best way to get a sense for these mechanisms is to see how the RSTP alternate port and \\nthe backup port both work. RSTP uses the term    alternate port  to refer to a switch’s other \\nports that could be used as root port if the root port ever fails. The backup port  concept \\nprovides    a backup port on the local switch for a designated port, but only applies to some topologies that frankly do not happen often with a modern network design. However, both are instructive about how RSTP works. Table 2-9 lists        these RSTP port roles.\\nTable 2-9 Port Roles in 802.1w RSTP\\nFunction Port Role\\nNonroot switch’s best path to the root Root port  \\nReplaces the root port when the root port fails Alternate port  \\nSwitch port designated to forward onto a collision domain Designated port  \\nReplaces a designated port when a designated port fails Backup port  \\nPort that is administratively disabled Disabled port  \\nRSTP and the Alternate (Root) Port Role\\nWith STP, each nonroot switch places one port in the STP root port (RP) role. RSTP fol-lows that same convention, with the same exact rules for choosing the RP. RSTP then takes another step, naming         other possible RPs, identifying them as \\nalternate ports .\\nTo be an alternate port, both the RP and the alternate port must receive Hellos that identify the same root switch. For instance, in Figure 2-8, SW1 is the root. SW3 will receive Hello BPDUs on two ports: G0/1 and G0/2. Both Hellos list SW1’s bridge ID (BID) as the root switch, so whichever port is not the root port meets the criteria to be an alternate port. SW3 picks G0/1 as its root port in this case, and then makes G0/2 an alternate port.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1\\nSW3SW2\\nLegend:\\n– Root Port\\n– Alternate Port– Discarding State\\n– Failing LinkRootDP RP\\nRPDP DP\\nRP\\nALT\\nALTRoot is    SW1\\nI am         SW2Root Cost = 4Root is    SW1I am         SW1Root Cost = 0\\nFigure 2-8 Example of SW3 Making G0/2 Become an Alternate Port\\nAn alternate port basically works like the second-best option for root port. The alternate \\nport can take over for the former root port, often very rapidly, without requiring a wait in \\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  61\\nother interim RSTP states. For instance, when the root port fails, or when Hellos stop arriv-\\ning on the original root port, the switch changes the former root port’s role and state: (a) the role from root port to a disabled port, and (b) the state from forwarding to   discarding (the equivalent of STP’s blocking state). Then, without waiting on any timers, the switch changes roles and state for the alternate port: its role changes to be the root port, with a forwarding state. \\nNotably, the new root port also does not need to spend time in other states, such as learn-\\ning state, instead moving immediately to forwarding state.\\nFigure 2-9 shows an example of RSTP convergence. SW3’s root port before the failure \\nshown in this figure is SW3’s G0/1, the link connected directly to         SW1 (the root switch). Then SW3’s link to SW1 fails as shown in Step 1 of the figure.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2 Gi0/1\\nRSTP\\nImmediate\\nChange toForwardingGi0/2SW1\\nSW3SW2\\nLegend:\\n– Root Port\\n– Alternate Port– Discarding State\\n– Failing Link12\\n34RootDP RP\\nRPDP DP ALT\\nRP\\nALTALT\\nFigure 2-9 Convergence Events with SW3 G0/1 Failure\\nFollowing the steps in Figure 2-9:\\nStep 1. The link between SW1 and SW3 fails, so that SW3’s current root port (Gi0/1) \\nfails. \\nStep 2. SW3 and SW2 exchange RSTP messages to confirm that SW3 will now transi-tion its former alternate port (Gi0/2) to be the root port. This action causes SW2 to flush the required MAC table entries.\\nStep 3. SW3 transitions G0/1 to the disabled role and G0/2 to the root port role. \\nStep 4. SW3 transitions G0/2 to a forwarding state immediately, without using learning state, because this is one case in which RSTP knows the transition will not cre-ate a loop.\\nAs soon as SW3 realizes its G0/1 interface has failed, the process shown in the figure takes \\nvery little time. None of the processes rely on timers, so as soon as the work         can be done, the convergence completes. (This particular convergence example takes about 1 second in a lab.)\\nptg1739636362  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRSTP States and Processes\\nThe depth of the previous example does not point out all details of RSTP, of course; how-\\never, the example does show enough details to discuss RSTP states and internal processes.\\nBoth STP and RSTP use port states , but       with some differences. First, RSTP keeps both \\nthe learning and forwarding states as compared with STP, for the same purposes. However, \\nRSTP does not even define a listening state, finding it unnecessary. Finally, RSTP renames the blocking state to the discarding state, and redefines its use slightly.\\nRSTP uses the discarding state for what 802.1D defines as two states: disabled state and \\nblocking state. Blocking should be somewhat obvious by now: The interface can work physically, but STP/RSTP chooses to not forward traffic to avoid loops. STP’s disabled state simply meant that the interface was administratively disabled. RSTP just combines those into a single discarding state. Table 2-10 shows   the list of STP and RSTP states for compari-son purposes.\\nTable 2-10 Port States Compared: 802.1D STP and 802.1w RSTP\\nFunction 802.1D State 802.1w State\\nPort is administratively disabled Disabled Discarding\\nStable state that ignores incoming data frames and is not \\nused to forward data framesBlocking Discarding\\nInterim state without MAC learning and without forwardingListening Not used\\nInterim state with MAC learning and without forwarding Learning Learning\\nStable state that allows MAC learning and forwarding of \\ndata framesForwarding Forwarding\\nRSTP also changes      some processes and message content (compared to STP) to speed con-\\nvergence. For example, STP waits for a time (forward delay) in both listening and learning states. The reason for this delay in STP is that, at the same time, the switches have all been told to time out their MAC table entries. When the topology changes, the existing MAC table entries may actually cause a loop. With STP, the switches all tell each other (with BPDU messages) that the topology has changed, and to time out any MAC table entries using the forward delay timer. This removes the entries, which is good, but it causes the need to wait in both listening and learning state for forward delay time (default 15 seconds each).\\nRSTP, to converge more quickly, avoids relying on timers. RSTP switches tell each other \\n(using messages) that the topology has changed. Those messages also direct neighboring switches to flush the contents of their MAC tables in a way that removes all the potentially loop-causing entries, without a wait. As a result, RSTP creates more scenarios in which a for-merly discarding port can immediately transition to a forwarding state, without waiting, and without using the learning state, as shown in the example in Figure 2-9.\\nRSTP and the Backup (Designated) Port Role\\nThe RSTP backup port role        acts as yet another new RSTP port role as compared to STP. As a reminder, the RSTP alternate port role creates a way for RSTP to quickly replace a switch’s root port. Similarly, the RSTP backup port role creates a way for RSTP to quickly replace a switch’s designated port on some LAN.\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  63\\nThe need for a backup port can be a bit confusing at first, because the need for the backup \\nport role only happens in designs that are a little unlikely today. The reason is that a design must use hubs, which then allows the possibility that one switch connects more than one port to the same collision domain.\\nFigure 2-10 shows an example. SW3 and SW4 both connect to the same hub. SW4’s port \\nF0/1 happens to win the election as designated port (DP). The other port on SW4 that con-nects to the same collision domain, F0/2, acts as a backup port.\\nWith a backup port, if the current designated port fails, SW4 can start using the backup \\nport with rapid convergence. For instance, if SW4’s F0/1 interface were to fail, SW4 could transition F0/2 to the designated port role, without any delay in        moving from discarding state to a forwarding state.\\nSW1\\nSW3SW2\\nF0/1 F0/4 F0/2SW4\\nHubDP Backup\\nFigure 2-10 RSTP Backup Port Example\\nRSTP Port Types\\nThe final RSTP concept included here relates to some terms RSTP uses to refer to different types of ports and the links that connect to those ports. \\nTo begin, consider the basic figure of Figure 2-11. It shows several links between two \\nswitches. RSTP considers these links to be point-to-point links and the ports connected to them to be point-to-point ports, because the link      connects exactly two devices (points).\\nRSTP further classifies          point-to-point ports into two categories. Point-to-point ports that \\nconnect two switches are not at the edge of the network and are simply called \\npoint-to-\\npoint ports . Ports that instead connect to a single endpoint device at the edge of the net-\\nwork, like a PC or server, are called point-to-point edge ports , or simply edge ports . In \\nFigure 2-11, SW3’s switch port connected to a PC is an edge port.\\nFinally, RSTP defines the term  shared  to describe ports connected to a hub. The term \\nshared  comes from the fact that hubs create a shared Ethernet; hubs also force the attached \\nswitch port to use half-duplex logic. RSTP assumes that all half-duplex ports may be con-\\nnected to hubs, treating ports that use half duplex as shared ports. RSTP converges more slowly on shared ports as compared to all point-to-point ports.\\nptg1739636364  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSW1\\nSW3SW2\\nSW4\\nHubPoint-to-point\\nEdge PortShared\\nPortPoint-to-point\\nPortPoint-to-point\\nPort\\nFigure 2-11 RSTP Link Types\\nOptional STP Features\\nAt this point, you have learned plenty of details that will be useful to next configure and \\nverify STP operations, as discussed in Chapter 3. However, before moving to that chapter, the final section of the chapter briefly introduces a few related topics that make STP work even better or be more secure: EtherChannel, PortFast, and BPDU Guard.\\nEtherChannel\\nOne of the best ways to lower STP’s convergence time is to avoid convergence altogether. EtherChannel provides     a way to prevent STP convergence from being needed when only a single port or cable failure occurs.\\nEtherChannel combines multiple parallel segments of equal speed (up to eight) between the \\nsame pair of switches, bundled into an EtherChannel. The switches treat the EtherChannel as a single interface with regard to STP. As a result, if one of the links fails, but at least one of the links is up, STP convergence does not have to occur. For example, Figure 2-12 shows the familiar three-switch network, but now with two Gigabit Ethernet connections between each pair of switches.\\nLarry Archie\\nBobSW2\\nSW3SW1\\nFigure 2-12 Two-Segment EtherChannels Between Switches\\nptg173963632Chapter 2: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts  65\\nWith each pair of Ethernet links configured as an EtherChannel, STP treats each \\nEtherChannel as a single link. In other words, both links to the same switch must fail for a switch to need to cause STP convergence. Without EtherChannel, if you have multiple par-allel links between two switches, STP blocks all the links except one. With EtherChannel, all the parallel links can be up and working at the same time, while reducing the number of times STP must converge, which in turn makes the network more available.\\nWhen a switch makes a forwarding decision to send a frame out an EtherChannel, the \\nswitch then has to take an extra step in logic: Out which physical interface does it send the frame? The switch has load-balancing logic that lets it pick an interface for each frame, with a goal of spreading the traffic load across all active links in the channel. As a result, a LAN design that uses EtherChannels makes much better use of the available bandwidth between switches, while also reducing the number of times that STP must converge.\\nNote that EtherChannels may be Layer 2 EtherChannels (as described here) or Layer \\n3 EtherChannels (as discussed in Chapter 19, “IPv4 Routing in the LAN”). Layer 2 EtherChannels combine links that switches use as switch ports, with the switches using Layer 2 switching logic to forward and receive Ethernet frames over the EtherChannels. Layer 3 EtherChannels also combine links, but the switches use Layer 3 routing logic to for-ward packets over the EtherChannels. All references to EtherChannel in Part I of this book refer to Layer 2 EtherChannels unless     otherwise noted.\\nPortFast\\nPortFast allows a switch to immediately     transition from blocking to forwarding, bypass-ing listening and learning states. However, the only ports on which you can safely enable PortFast are ports on which you know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking devices are connected. Otherwise, using PortFast risks creating loops, the very thing that the listening and learning states are intended to avoid.\\nPortFast is most appropriate for connections to end-user devices. If you turn on PortFast on \\nports connected to end-user devices, when an end-user PC boots, the switch port can move to an STP forwarding state and forward traffic as soon as the PC NIC is active. Without PortFast, each port must wait while the switch confirms that the port is a DP, and then wait while the interface sits in the temporary listening and learning states before settling into the forwarding state.\\nPortFast is a popular feature for edge ports; in fact, RSTP incorporates PortFast concepts. \\nYou may recall the mention of RSTP port types, particularly point-to-point edge port types, around Figure 2-11. RSTP, by design of the protocol, converges quickly on these point-to-point edge type ports by bypassing the learning state, which is the same idea Cisco origi-nally introduced with PortFast. In practice, Cisco switches     enable RSTP point-to-point edge ports by enabling PortFast on the port.\\nBPDU Guard\\nSTP opens     up the LAN to several different types of possible security exposures. For example:\\n■An attacker could connect a switch to one of these ports, one with a low STP priority\\nvalue, and become the root switch. The new STP topology could have worse perfor-\\nmance than the desired topology.\\nptg1739636366  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n■The attacker could plug into multiple ports, into multiple switches, become root, and\\nactually forward much of the traffic in the LAN. Without the networking staff realizing\\nit, the attacker could use a LAN analyzer to copy large numbers of data frames sentthrough the LAN.\\n■Users could innocently harm the LAN when they buy and connect an inexpensive con-\\nsumer LAN switch (one that does not use STP). Such a switch, without any STP function,would not choose to block any ports and could     cause a loop.\\nThe \\nCisco BPDU Guard  feature   helps defeat these kinds of problems by disabling a port \\nif any BPDUs are received on the port. So, this feature is particularly useful on ports that \\nshould be used only as an access port and never connected to another switch.\\nIn addition, the BPDU Guard feature helps prevent problems with PortFast. PortFast should \\nbe enabled only on access ports that connect to user devices, not to other LAN switches. Using BPDU Guard on these same ports makes sense because if another switch connects to such a port, the local switch can disable the port before a loop is created.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

However, network engineers who work with medium-size to large-size Ethernet LANs usually want to configure at least some STP settings. First and foremost, Cisco IOS switches traditionally default to use STP rather than Rapid STP (RSTP), and the simple upgrade to RSTP improves convergence. For most LANs with more than a few switches, the network engineer will likely want to influence the choices made by STP, whether using traditional STP or RSTP—choices such as which switch becomes root, with predictability about which switch ports will block/discard when all ports are physically working. The configuration can also be set so that when links or switches fail, the engineer can predict the STP topology in those cases, as well.\\nThis chapter discusses configuration and verification of STP. The first major section weaves \\na story of how to change different settings, per VLAN, with the \\nshow  commands that   \\nreveal the current STP status affected by each configuration command. Those settings impact both STP and RSTP, but the examples use switches that use traditional 802.1D STP rather than RSTP. The second major section shows how to configure the same optional STP features mentioned in Chapter 2: PortFast, BPDU Guard, and EtherChannel (specifically Layer 2 EtherChannel). The final major section of this chapter looks at the simple (one com-mand) configuration to enable RSTP, and the differences and similarities in \\nshow  command \\noutput that occur when using RSTP versus STP.\\nptg17396363“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help \\nyou decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

You can buy some Cisco switches and connect them with Ethernet cables in a redundant topology, and STP will ensure that frames do not loop. And you never even have to think about changing any settings!\\nAlthough STP works without any configuration, most medium-size to large-size campus \\nLANs benefit from some    STP configuration. With all defaults, the switches choose the root based on the lowest burned-in MAC address on the switches because they all default to use the same STP priority. As a better option, configure the switches so that the root is predict-able.\\nFor instance, Figure 3-1 shows a typical LAN design model, with two distribution layer \\nswitches (D1 and D2). The design may have dozens of access layer switches that connect to end users; the figure shows just three access switches (A1, A2, and A3). For a variety of rea-sons, most network engineers make the distribution layer switches be the root. For instance, the configuration could make D1 be the root by having a lower priority, with D2 config-ured with the next lower priority, so it becomes root if D1 fails.\\n10/100/1000Distribution\\nSwitches\\nAccess\\nSwitchesD1 D2\\nA1\\n10/100/1000A2\\n10/100/1000A3Best Choices to be Root\\nFigure 3-1 Typical Configuration Choice: Making Distribution Switch Be Root\\nThis first section of the chapter examines a variety of topics that somehow relate to STP \\nconfiguration. It begins with a look at STP configuration options, as a way to link the con-cepts of Chapter 2 to the configuration choices in this chapter. Following that, this section introduces some \\nshow  commands for the purpose of verifying the default STP settings \\nbefore changing any configuration. \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B, C 2 B 3 A, D 4 D 5 A, D 6 B, D\\nptg1739636372  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSetting the STP Mode\\nChapter 2 described how 802.1D STP works     in one VLAN. Now that this chapter turns our \\nattention to STP configuration in Cisco switches, one of the first questions is this: Which kind of STP do you intend to use in a LAN? And to answer that question, you need to know a little more background.\\nThe IEEE first standardized STP as the IEEE 802.1D standard, first published back in 1990. \\nTo put some perspective on that date, Cisco sold no LAN switches at the time, and virtual LANs did not exist yet. Instead of multiple VLANs in a LAN, there was just one broadcast domain, and one instance of STP. However, the addition of VLANs and the introduction of LAN switches into the market have created a need to add to and extend STP. \\nToday, Cisco IOS–based LAN switches allow you to use one of three STP configuration \\nmodes that reflect that history. The first two sections of this chapter use the mode called Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus    (PVST+, or sometimes PVSTP), a Cisco-proprietary improve-ment of 802.1D STP. The \\nper-VLAN  part of the name gives away the main feature: PVST+ \\ncreates a different STP topology per VLAN, whereas 802.1D actually did not. PVST+ also introduced PortFast. Cisco switches often use PVST+ as the default STP mode per a default global command   of \\nspanning-tree mode pvst . \\nOver time, Cisco added RSTP support as well, with two STP modes that happen to use RSTP. One mode basically takes PVST+ and upgrades it to use RSTP logic as well, with a mode called \\nRapid PVST+ , enabled     with the global command   spanning-tree mode \\nrapid-pvst . Cisco IOS–based switches support a third mode, called Multiple Spanning Tree \\n(MST) (or Multiple Instance of Spanning Tree), enabled with the spanning-tree mode mst  \\ncommand. (This book does not discuss MST beyond this brief mention; the       CCNP Switch exam typically includes MST details.)\\nConnecting STP Concepts to STP Configuration Options\\nIf you think back to the details of STP operation in Chapter 2, STP uses two types of num-bers for most of its decisions: the BID and STP port costs. Focusing on those two types of numbers, consider this summary of what   STP does behind the scenes:\\n■Uses the BID to elect the root switch, electing the switch with the numerically lowest\\nBID\\n■Uses the total STP cost in each path to the root, when each nonroot switch chooses its\\nown root port (RP)\\n■Uses each switch’s root cost, which is in turn based on STP port costs, when switches\\ndecide which switch port becomes the designated port (DP) on each LAN segment\\nUnsurprisingly, Cisco switches let you configure part of a switch’s BID and the STP port cost, which in turn influences the choices each switch makes with STP.\\nPer-VLAN Configuration Settings\\nBeyond supporting the     configuration of the BID and STP port costs, Cisco switches support configuring both settings per VLAN. By default, Cisco switches use IEEE 802.1D, not RSTP (802.1w), with a Cisco-proprietary feature called Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+). PVST+ (often abbreviated as simply PVST today) creates a different instance of STP for \\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  73\\neach VLAN. So, before looking at the tunable STP parameters, you need to have a basic \\nunderstanding of PVST+, because the configuration settings can differ for each instance of STP.\\nPVST+ gives engineers a load-balancing tool with STP. By changing some STP configura-\\ntion parameters differently for different VLANs, the engineer could cause switches to pick different RPs and DPs in different VLANs. As a result, some traffic in some VLANs can be forwarded over one trunk, and traffic for other VLANs can be forwarded over a different trunk.\\nFigure 3-2 shows the basic idea, with SW3 forwarding odd-numbered VLAN traffic over \\nthe left trunk (Gi0/1) and even-numbered VLANs over the right trunk (Gi0/2).\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1RootVLAN 1 STP Topology\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1RootVLAN 2 STP Topology\\nFigure 3-2 Load Balancing with PVST+\\nThe next few pages look specifically at how to     change the BID and STP port cost settings, per VLAN, when using the default PVST+ mode.\\nThe Bridge ID and System ID Extension\\nOriginally, a switch’s BID was formed        by combining the switch’s 2-byte priority and its 6-byte MAC address. Later, the IEEE changed the rules, splitting the original priority field into two separate fields, as shown in Figure 3-3: a 4-bit priority field and a 12-bit subfield called the \\nsystem ID extension  (which represents the VLAN ID).\\nPriority\\n(0 – 65,535)System ID\\n(MAC Address)\\nSystem ID Extension\\n(Typically Holds VLAN ID)Priority\\n(Multiple\\nof 4096)6 Bytes\\nSystem ID\\n(MAC Address)2 Bytes\\n12 Bits 4 BitsOriginal Format\\nBridge ID\\nSystem IDExtension(MAC AddressReduction)\\n6 Bytes\\nFigure 3-3 STP System ID Extension\\nCisco switches let you configure the BID, but only the priority part. The switch fills in its \\nuniversal (burned-in) MAC address as the system ID. It also plugs in the VLAN ID of a \\nptg1739636374  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nVLAN in the 12-bit system ID extension field. The only part configurable by the network \\nengineer is the 4-bit priority field.\\nConfiguring the number to put in the priority field, however, is one of the strangest things \\nto configure on a Cisco router or switch. As shown at the top of Figure 3-3, the priority field was originally a 16-bit number, which represented a decimal number from 0 to 65,535. Because of that history, the current configuration command   (\\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  \\npriority  x) requires a decimal number between 0 and 65,535. But not just any number in \\nthat range will suffice—it must be a multiple of 4096: 0, 4096, 8192, 12288, and so on, up through 61,440.\\nThe switch still sets the first 4 bits of the BID based on the configured value. As it turns out, \\nof the 16 allowed multiples of 4096, from 0 through 61,440, each has a different binary value in their first 4 bits: 0000, 0001, 0010, and so on, up through 1111. The switch sets the true 4-bit priority based on the first 4 bits of the configured value.\\nAlthough the history and configuration might make the BID priority idea seem a bit convo-\\nluted, having an extra 12-bit field in the BID works well in practice because it can be used to identify the VLAN ID. VLAN IDs range from 1 to 4094, requiring 12 bits. Cisco switches place the VLAN ID into the system ID extension field, so each switch has a unique BID per VLAN.\\nFor example, a switch configured with VLANs 1 through 4, with a default base priority \\nof 32,768, has a default STP priority of 32,769 in VLAN 1, 32,770 in VLAN 2, 32,771 in VLAN 3, and so on. So, you can view the 16-bit priority as a base priority (as configured in the \\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  priority  x command) plus        the VLAN ID.\\nNOTE Cisco switches must use the system ID extension version of the bridge ID; it cannot be disabled.\\nPer-VLAN Port Costs\\nEach switch interface defaults its        per-VLAN STP cost based on the IEEE recommendations listed in Table 2-6 in Chapter 2. On interfaces that support multiple speeds, Cisco switches base the cost on the current actual speed. So, if an interface negotiates to use a lower speed, the default STP cost reflects that lower speed. If the interface negotiates to use a different speed, the switch dynamically changes the STP port cost as well.\\nAlternatively, you can configure a switch’s STP port cost with the \\nspanning-tree  [vlan  \\nvlan-id ] cost  cost  interface subcommand. You see this command most often on trunks \\nbecause setting the cost on trunks has an impact on the switch’s root cost, whereas setting \\nSTP costs on access ports does not.\\nFor the command itself, it can include the VLAN ID, or not. The command only needs \\na vlan  parameter on trunk ports to set the cost per VLAN. On a trunk, if the command \\nomits the VLAN parameter, it sets the STP cost for all VLANs whose        cost is not set by a \\nspanning-tree vlan  x cost  command for that VLAN.\\nSTP Configuration Option Summary\\nTable 3-2 summarizes the default settings for both the BID and the port costs and lists the optional configuration    commands covered in this chapter.\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  75\\nTable 3-2 STP Defaults and Configuration Options\\nSetting Default Command(s) to Change Default\\nBID priority Base: 32,768 spanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  root {primary  | secondary }\\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  priority  priority\\nInterface cost 100 for 10 Mbps\\n19 for 100 Mbps\\n4 for 1 Gbps2 for 10 Gbpsspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  cost  cost\\nPortFast Not enabled spanning-tree portfast   \\nBPDU Guard Not enabled spanning-tree bpduguard enable      \\nNext, the configuration section shows how to examine the operation of STP in a simple net-\\nwork, along with how to change these optional settings.\\nVerifying STP Operation\\nBefore taking a look at how to change the configuration, first consider a few STP verifica-tion commands. Looking at these commands first will help reinforce the default STP set-tings. In particular, the examples      in this section use the network shown in Figure 3-4.\\nLarry\\nFa0/11\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1Fa0/12Archie\\nBobFa0/13DPDPDP\\nDPDP DP\\nRP\\n      \\n        – Designated PortRP\\nLegend:\\n        – Root Port\\nDPRP\\n– Blocking Port\\nFigure 3-4 Sample LAN for STP Configuration and Verification Examples\\nExample 3-1 begins the discussion with a useful command for STP: the show \\nspanning-tree vlan 10  command.

This command first lists three major groups of messages: one group of messages \\nabout the root switch, followed by another group about the local switch, and ending with interface role and status information. In this case, SW1 lists its own BID as the root, with \\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  77\\neven a specific statement that “This bridge is the root,” confirming that SW1 is now the root \\nof the VLAN 10 STP topology.\\nNext, compare the highlighted lines of the same command on SW2 in the lower half of the \\nexample. SW2 lists SW1’s BID details as the root; in other words, SW2 agrees that SW1 has won the root election. SW2 does not list the phrase “This bridge is the root.” SW2 then lists its own (different) BID details in the lines after the details       about the root’s BID.\\nThe output also confirms a few default values. First, each switch lists the priority part of \\nthe BID as a separate number: 32778. This value comes from the default priority of 32768, plus VLAN 10, for a total of 32778. The output also shows the interface cost for some Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, defaulting to 19 and 4, respectively.\\nFinally, the bottom of the output from the \\nshow spanning-tree  command lists each \\ninterface in the VLAN, including trunks, with the STP port role and port state listed. For \\ninstance, on switch SW1, the output lists three interfaces, with a role of Desg for designated port (DP) and a state of FWD for forwarding. SW2 lists three interfaces, two DPs, and one root port, so all three are in an FWD or forwarding state.\\nExample 3-1 shows a lot of good STP information, but two other commands, shown in \\nExample 3-2, work better for listing BID information in a shorter form. The first, \\nshow \\nspanning-tree root , lists   the root’s BID for each VLAN. This command also lists other \\ndetails, like the local switch’s root cost and root port. The other command, show \\nspanning-tree vlan 10 bridge , breaks out the BID into its component parts. In this \\nexample, it shows SW2’s priority as the default of 32768, the VLAN ID of 10, and             the MAC address.\\nExample 3-2 Listing Root Switch and Local Switch BIDs on Switch SW2\\nSW2# show spanning-tree root\\nRoot    Hello Max Fwd\\nVlan                   Root ID          Cost    Time  Age Dly  Root Port\\n---------------- -------------------- --------- ----- --- ---  ------------VLAN0001 32769 1833.9d5d.c900 23    2   20  15  Gi0/1 \\nVLAN0010 32778 1833.9d7b.0e80 4    2   20  15  Gi0/2\\nVLAN0020 32788 1833.9d7b.0e80 4    2   20  15  Gi0/2\\nVLAN0030 32798 1833.9d7b.0e80 4    2   20  15  Gi0/2\\nVLAN0040 32808 1833.9d7b.0e80 4    2   20  15  Gi0/2 \\nSW2# show spanning-tree vlan 10 bridge\\nHello  Max  Fwd\\nVlan                         Bridge ID              Time  Age  Dly  Protocol\\n---------------- --------------------------------- -----  ---  ---  --------\\nVLAN0010         32778 (32768,  10) 1833.9d7b.1380    2    20   15  ieee  \\nNote that both the commands in Example 3-2 have a VLAN option: show spanning-tree  \\n[vlan  x] root  and show spanning-tree  [vlan x ] bridge .

To show how it works, consider the following example, which changes what hap-\\npens in the network shown in Figure 3-4.\\nBack in Figure 3-4, with default settings, SW1 became root, and SW3 blocked on its G0/2 \\ninterface. A brief scan of the figure, based on the default STP cost of 4 for Gigabit inter-faces, shows that SW3 should have found a cost 4 path and a cost 8 path to reach the root, as shown in Figure 3-5.\\nGi0/1Total\\nCost = 8TotalCost = 4\\nGi0/2Gi0/2SW2\\nSW3SW1\\nCost 4Cost 4\\nCost 4Root\\nFigure 3-5 Analysis of SW3’s Current Root Cost of 4 with Defaults\\nTo show the effects of changing the port cost, the next example shows a change to SW3’s \\nconfiguration, setting its G0/1 port cost higher so that the better path to the root goes out SW3’s G0/2 port instead. Example 3-3 also shows several other      interesting effects.\\nExample 3-3 Manipulating STP Port Cost and Watching the Transition to Forwarding \\nState\\nSW3# debug spanning-tree events\\nSpanning Tree event debugging is on\\nSW3# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

This command \\ntells the switch to issue debug log messages whenever STP performs changes to an interface’s \\nrole or state. These messages show up in the example as a result of the configuration.\\nNext, the example shows the configuration to change SW3’s port cost, in VLAN 10, to 30, \\nwith the spanning-tree vlan 10 cost 30  interface subcommand. Based on the figure, the \\nroot cost through SW3’s G0/1 will now be 30 instead of 4. As a result, SW3’s best cost to reach the root is cost 8, with SW3’s G0/2 as its root port.\\nThe debug messages tell us what STP on SW3 is thinking behind the scenes, with time-\\nstamps. Note that the first five debug messages, displayed immediately after the user exited configuration mode in this case, all happen at the same time (down to the same millisec-ond). Notably, G0/1, which had been forwarding, immediately moves to a blocking state. Interface G0/2, which had been blocking, does not go to a forwarding state, instead moving to a listening state (at least, according to this message).\\nNow look for the debug message that lists G0/2 transitioning to learning state, and then the \\nnext one that shows it finally reaching forwarding state. How long between the messages? In each case, the message’s timestamps show that 15 seconds passed. In this experiment, the switches used a default setting of forward delay (15 seconds). So, these debug messages confirm the steps that STP takes to transition an interface from blocking to forwarding state.\\nIf you did not happen to enable a debug when configuring the cost, using \\nshow  commands \\nlater can confirm the same choice by SW3, to now use its G0/2 port as its RP. Example 3-4 \\nshows the new STP port cost setting on SW3, along with the new root port and root cost, using the \\nshow spanning-tree vlan 10 command. Note that G0/2 is now listed as the root port. The \\ntop of the output lists SW3’s root cost as 8, matching the analysis      shown in Figure 3-5.\\nExample 3-4 New STP Status and Settings on SW3\\nSW3# show spanning-tree vlan 10\\nVLAN0010\\n  Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee\\n  Root ID    Priority    32778\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.0e80Cost 8\\nPort 26 (GigabitEthernet0/2)\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\n  Bridge ID  Priority    32778  (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 10)\\nAddress     f47f.35cb.d780\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 secAging Time  300 sec\\nInterface           Role Sts Cost      Prio.Nbr Type------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- --------------------------------\\nFa0/23 Desg FWD 19 128.23   P2p\\nGi0/1 Altn BLK 30 128.25   P2p\\nGi0/2 Root FWD 4 128.26   P2p\\nptg1739636380  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nConfiguring Priority to Influence the Root Election\\nThe other big STP configuration option      is to influence the root election by changing the \\npriority of a switch. The priority can be set explicitly with the spanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  \\npriority  value  global configuration command, which sets the base priority of the switch. \\n(This is the command that requires a parameter of a multiple of 4096.)\\nHowever, Cisco gives us a better configuration option than configuring a specific priority \\nvalue. In most designs, the network engineers pick two switches to be root: one to be root if all switches are up, and another to take over if the first switch fails. Switch IOS supports this idea with the \\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  root primary  and spanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  \\nroot secondary  commands.\\nThe spanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  root primary  command tells the switch to set its priority \\nlow enough to become root right now. The switch looks at the current root in that VLAN, and at the root’s priority. Then the local switch chooses a priority value that causes the local switch to take over as root.\\nRemembering that Cisco switches use a default base priority of 32,768, this command \\nchooses the base priority as follows:\\n■If the current root has a base priority higher than 24,576, the local switch uses a base pri-\\nority of 24,576.\\n■If the current root’s base priority is 24,576 or lower, the local switch sets its base priority\\nto the highest multiple of 4096 that still results in the local switch becoming root.\\nFor the switch intended to take over as the root if the first switch fails, use the \\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  root secondary  command. This command is much like the \\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  root primary  command, but with a priority value worse than \\nthe primary switch but better than all the other switches. This command sets the switch’s base priority to 28,672 regardless of the current root’s current priority value.\\nFor example, in Figures 3-4 and 3-5, SW1 was the root switch, and as shown in various com-\\nmands, all three switches defaulted to use a base priority of 32,768. Example 3-5 shows a configuration that makes SW2 the primary root, and SW1 the secondary, just to show the role move from one to the other. These commands result in SW2      having a base priority of 24,576, and SW1 having a base priority of 28,672.\\nExample 3-5 Making SW2 Become Root Primary, and SW1 Root Secondary\\n!

First, the show spanning-tree bridge  command lists the local switch’s BID \\ninformation, while the show spanning-tree root      command lists the root’s BID, plus the \\nlocal switch’s root cost and root port (assuming it is not the root switch). So, SW1 lists its \\nown BID, with priority 28,682 (base 28,672, with VLAN 10) with the show spanning-tree \\nbridge  command. Still on SW1, the output lists the root’s priority as 24,586 in VLAN 10, \\nimplied as base 24,576 plus 10 for VLAN 10, with the show spanning-tree root      com-\\nmand.\\nNote that alternatively you could have configured the priority settings specifically. SW1 \\ncould have used the spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 28672  command, with SW2 using \\nthe spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 24576  command. In this particular case, both options \\nwould result in the same STP operation.\\nImplementing Optional STP Features\\nThis just-completed first major section of the chapter showed examples that used PVST+ only, assuming a default global command of \\nspanning-tree mode pvst . At the same time, \\nall the configuration commands shown in that first section, commands that influence STP operation, would influence both traditional STP and RSTP operation. \\nThis section, the second of three major sections in this chapter, now moves on to discuss \\nsome useful but optional features that make both STP and RSTP work even better.\\nConfiguring PortFast and BPDU Guard\\nYou can easily configure         the PortFast and BPDU Guard features on any interface, but with two different configuration options. One option works best when you want to enable these features only on a few ports, and the other works best when you want to enable these fea-tures on most every access port.\\nFirst, to enable the features on just one port at a time, use the     \\nspanning-tree portfast  and \\nthe spanning-tree bpduguard enable  interface subcommands. Example 3-6 shows an \\nptg1739636382  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nexample of the process, with SW3’s F0/4 interface enabling both features. (Also, note the \\nlong warning message IOS lists when enabling PortFast; using PortFast on a port connected to other switches can indeed cause serious problems.)\\nExample 3-6 Enabling PortFast and BPDU Guard on One Interface\\nSW3# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nSW3(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/4\\nSW3(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast\\n%Warning: portfast should only be enabled on ports connected to a single host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this\\n interface  when portfast is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.\\n Use with CAUTION\\n%Portfast has been configured on FastEthernet0/4 but will only\\n have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.\\nSW3(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard ?\\n  disable  Disable BPDU guard for this interface\\n  enable   Enable BPDU guard for this interface\\nSW3(config-if)# spanning-tree bpduguard enable\\nSW3(config-if)# ^Z\\nSW3#\\nExample 3-7 shows some brief information about the interface configuration of both \\nPortFast and BPDU Guard. Of course, the show running-config  command (not shown) \\nwould confirm the configuration commands from Example 3-6. The show spanning-tree \\ninterface fastethernet0/4 portfast  command in Example 3-7 lists the PortFast sta-\\ntus of the interface; note that the status value of enabled is displayed only if PortFast is configured and the interface is up. The   \\nshow spanning-tree interface detail  command \\nthen shows a line near the end of the output that states that PortFast and BPDU Guard are enabled. Note that this command would not list those two highlighted lines of output if these two           features were not enabled.\\nExample 3-7 Verifying PortFast and BPDU Guard Configuration\\nSW3# show spanning-tree interface fastethernet0/4 portfast\\nVLAN0104            enabled\\nSW11# show spanning-tree interface F0/4 detail\\n Port 4 (FastEthernet0/4) of VLAN0001 is designated forwarding \\n   Port path cost 19, Port priority 128, Port Identifier 128.4.\\n   Designated root has priority 32769, address bcc4.938b.a180\\n   Designated bridge has priority 32769, address bcc4.938b.e500   Designated port id is 128.4, designated path cost 19\\n   Timers: message age 0, forward delay 0, hold 0\\n   Number of transitions to forwarding state: 1\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  83\\n   The port is in the portfast mode\\n   Link type is point-to-point by default\\n   Bpdu guard is enabled\\n   BPDU: sent 1721, received 0\\nPortFast and BPDU Guard are disabled by default on all interfaces, and to use them, each \\ninterface requires interface subcommands like those in Example 3-6. Alternately, for both features, you can enable the feature globally. Then, for interfaces for which the feature should be disabled, you can           use another interface subcommand to disable the feature. \\nThe ability to change the global default for these features reduces the number of interface \\nsubcommands required. For instance, on an access layer switch with 48 access ports and two uplinks, you probably want to enable both PortFast and BPDU Guard on all 48 access ports. Rather than requiring the interface subcommands on all 48 of those ports, enable the fea-tures globally, and then disable them on the uplink ports.\\nTable 3-3 summarizes the commands to enable and disable both PortFast and BPDU Guard, \\nboth globally and per interface. For instance, the global command     \\nspanning-tree portfast \\ndefault  changes the default so that all interfaces use PortFast, unless a port also has the \\nspanning-tree portfast disable  interface subcommand           configured. \\nTable 3-3 Enabling and Disabling PortFast and BPDU Gsuard, Globally and Per Interface\\nAction Globally One Interface\\nDisable PortFast no spanning-tree portfast default spanning-tree portfast \\ndisable\\nEnable PortFast spanning-tree portfast default spanning-tree portfast\\nDisable BPDU Guard no spanning-tree portfast \\nbpduguard defaultspanning-tree bpduguard disable\\nEnable BPDU Guard spanning-tree portfast bpduguard defaultspanning-tree bpduguard enable\\nExample 3-8 shows another new command, show spanning-tree summary . This com-\\nmand shows the current global settings for several STP parameters, including the PortFast \\nand BPDU Guard features. This output was gathered               on a switch that had enabled both PortFast and BPDU Guard globally.\\nExample 3-8 Displaying Status of Global Settings for PortFast and BPDU Guard\\nSW1# show spanning-tree summary \\nSwitch is in pvst mode\\nRoot bridge for: none\\nEtherChannel misconfig guard is enabled\\nExtended system ID is enabled\\nPortfast Default is enabled\\nPortFast BPDU Guard Default  is enabled\\nPortfast BPDU Filter Default is disabled\\nLoopguard Default is disabled\\nUplinkFast is disabled\\nBackboneFast is disabled\\nptg1739636384  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nConfigured Pathcost method used is short\\nName                   Blocking Listening Learning Forwarding STP Active\\n---------------------- -------- --------- -------- ---------- ----------\\nVLAN0001 3 0 0 2 5\\n---------------------- -------- --------- -------- ---------- ----------\\n1 vlan 3 0 0 2 5\\nConfiguring EtherChannel\\nAs introduced back in Chapter 2, two     neighboring switches can treat multiple parallel links \\nbetween each other as a single logical link called an EtherChannel . STP operates on the \\nEtherChannel, instead of the individual physical links, so that STP either forwards or blocks on the entire logical EtherChannel for a given VLAN. As a result, a switch in a forwarding state can then load balance traffic over all the physical links in the EtherChannel. Without EtherChannel, only one of the parallel links between two switches would be allowed to for-ward traffic, with the rest of the links blocked by STP.\\nNOTE All references to EtherChannel in this Chapter refer to Layer 2 EtherChannels, and not to Layer 3 EtherChannels (as discussed in Chapter 19, “IPv4 Routing in the LAN”).\\nEtherChannel may be one of the most challenging switch features to make work. First, the configuration has several options, so you have to remember the details of which options work together. Second, the switches also require a variety of other interface settings to match among all the links in the channel, so you have to know those settings as well.\\nThis section focuses on the correct EtherChannel configuration. Chapter 4’s section \\n“Troubleshooting Layer 2 EtherChannel” looks at many of the potential problems with EtherChannel, including all those other configuration settings     that a switch checks before allowing the EtherChannel to work.\\nConfiguring a Manual EtherChannel\\nThe simplest way to      configure an EtherChannel is to add the correct channel-group   con-\\nfiguration command to each physical interface, on each switch, all with the on keyword. \\nThe on keyword tells the switches to place a physical interface into an EtherChannel.\\nBefore getting into the configuration and verification, however, you need to start using three terms as synonyms: \\nEtherChannel , PortChannel , and Channel-group . Oddly, IOS \\nuses the channel-group  configuration command, but then to display its status, IOS uses the \\nshow etherchannel  command. Then, the output of this show  command refers to neither \\nan “EtherChannel” nor a “Channel-group,” instead using the term “PortChannel.” So, pay close attention to these three terms in the example.\\nTo configure an EtherChannel manually, follow these steps:\\nStep 1. Add the channel-group number mode on command in interface configuration \\nmode under each physical interface that should be in the channel to add it to \\nthe channel.\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  85\\nStep 2. Use the same number for all commands on the same switch, but the channel-\\ngroup number on the neighboring switch can differ.\\nExample 3-9 shows a simple example, with two links between switches SW1 and SW2, as \\nshown in Figure 3-6. The configuration shows      SW1’s two interfaces placed into channel-group 1, with two \\nshow  commands to follow.\\nFa0/14\\nFa0/15Fa0/16\\nFa0/17SW1 SW2Channel-group 2 Channel-group 1\\nFigure 3-6 Sample LAN Used in EtherChannel Example\\nExample 3-9 Configuring and Monitoring EtherChannel\\nSW1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

First, the show spanning-tree  command lists Po1, short for PortChannel1, as an inter-\\nface. This interface exists because of the channel-group  commands using the 1 parameter. \\nSTP no longer operates on physical interfaces F0/14 and F0/15, instead operating on the \\nPortChannel1 interface, so only that interface is listed in the output.\\nNext, note the output of the   show etherchannel 1 summary  command. It lists as a head-\\ning “Port-channel,” with Po1 below it. It also lists both F0/14 and F0/15 in the list of ports, \\nwith a (P) beside each. Per the legend, the P means that the ports are bundled in the port \\nchannel, which is a code that means these ports have passed      all the configuration checks and are valid to be included in the channel.\\nNOTE Cisco uses the term \\nEtherChannel  to refer to the concepts discussed in this sec-\\ntion. To refer to the item configured in the switch, Cisco instead uses  the term port chan-\\nnel, with the command keyword port-channel . For the purposes of understanding the \\ntechnology, you may treat these terms as synonyms. However, it helps to pay close atten-tion to the use of the terms \\nport channel  and EtherChannel  as you work through the \\nexamples in this section, because IOS uses both.\\nConfiguring Dynamic EtherChannels\\nCisco switches support two different protocols      that allow the switches to negotiate whether a particular link becomes part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration enables the protocol for a particular channel-group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol to send messages to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass all checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be resolved.\\nCisco switches support the      Cisco-proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and the \\nIEEE standard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), based on IEEE standard 802.3ad. Although differences exist between the two, to the depth discussed here, they both accom-plish the same task: negotiate so that only links that pass the configuration checks are actu-ally used in an EtherChannel.\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  87\\nTo configure either protocol, a switch uses the channel-group  configuration commands \\non each switch, but with a keyword that either means “use this protocol and begin negotia-\\ntions” or “use this protocol and wait for the other switch to begin negotiations.” As shown in Figure 3-7, the \\ndesirable  and auto  keywords enable PAgP, and the active  and passive  \\nkeywords enable LACP. With these options, at least one side has to begin the negotia-tions. In other words, with PAgP, at least one of the two sides must use \\ndesirable , and with \\nLACP, at least one of the two sides must use active .\\nG0/1\\nG0/2G0/2\\nG0/1SW1 SW2channel-group 2 mode { desirable | auto } channel-group 1 mode desirableUsing PAgP\\nchannel-group 2 mode { active | passive} channel-group 1 mode active\\nUsing LACPBegins\\nNegotiations\\nFigure 3-7 Correct EtherChannel Configuration Combinations\\nNOTE Do not use the on parameter on one end, and either auto  or desirable  (or for \\nLACP, active  or passive ) on the neighboring switch. The on option uses neither PAgP nor \\nLACP, so a configuration that uses on, with PAgP or LACP options on the other end, would \\nprevent the EtherChannel from working.\\nFor example, in the design shown in Figure 3-7, imagine both physical interfaces on both switches were configured with the \\nchannel-group 2 mode desirable  interface subcom-\\nmand. As a result, the two switches would negotiate and create an EtherChannel. Example 3-10 shows the verification of that configuration, with the command \\nshow etherchannel \\n2 port-channel . This command confirms the protocol in use (PAgP, because      the desirable  \\nkeyword was configured), and the list of interfaces in the channel.\\nExample 3-10 EtherChannel Verification: PAgP Desirable Mode\\nSW1# show etherchannel 2 port-channel  \\nPort-channels in the group: \\n---------------------------\\nPort-channel: Po2\\n------------\\nAge of the Port-channel   = 0d:00h:04m:04s\\nLogical slot/port   = 16/1 Number of ports = 2\\nGC = 0x00020001 HotStandBy port = null\\nPort state = Port-channel Ag-Inuse \\nProtocol =   PAgP\\nPort security = Disabled\\nptg1739636388  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPorts in the Port-channel: \\nIndex   Load   Port     EC state        No of bits\\n------+------+------+------------------+-----------\\n  0     00     Gi0/1    Desirable-Sl 0\\n  0     00     Gi0/2    Desirable-Sl 0\\nTime since last port bundled:    0d:00h:03m:57s    Gi0/2\\nImplementing RSTP\\nAll you have to do to   migrate from STP to RSTP is to configure the spanning-tree mode \\nrapid-pvst  global command on all the switches. However, for exam preparation, it helps \\nto work through the various show  commands, particularly to prepare for Simlet questions. \\nThose questions can ask you to interpret show  command output without allowing you to \\nlook at the configuration, and the output of show  commands when using STP versus RSTP \\nis very similar. \\nThis third and final major section of this chapter focuses on pointing out the similarities and \\ndifferences between STP and RSTP as seen in Catalyst switch configuration and verification commands. This section explains the configuration and verification of RSTP, with emphasis on how to identify RSTP features.\\nIdentifying the STP Mode on a Catalyst Switch\\nCisco Catalyst switches operate in some STP mode        as defined by the spanning-tree mode  \\nglobal configuration command. Based on this command’s setting, the switch is using either 802.1D STP or 802.1w RSTP, as noted in Table 3-4.\\nTable 3-4 Cisco Catalyst STP Configuration Modes\\nParameter on \\nspanning-tree mode CommandUses STP or RSTP?Protocol Listed in Command OutputDescription\\npvst STP ieee Default; Per-VLAN Spanning Tree instance\\nrapid-pvst RSTP rstp Like PVST, but uses RSTP rules instead of \\nSTP for each STP instance\\nmst RSTP mst Creates multiple RSTP instances but does not require one instance per each VLAN\\nTo determine whether a Cisco Catalyst switch uses       RSTP, you can look for two types of \\ninformation. First, you can look at the configuration, as noted in the left column of Table 3-4. Also, some \\nshow  commands list the STP protocol as a reference to the configuration \\nof the spanning-tree mode  global configuration command. A protocol of rstp  or mst \\nrefers to one of the modes that uses RSTP, and a protocol of ieee  refers to the mode that \\nhappens to use STP.\\nBefore looking at an example of the output, review the topology in Figure 3-8. The remain-\\ning RSTP examples in this chapter use this topology. In the RSTP examples      in this chapter, SW1 will become root, and SW3 will block on one port (G0/2), as shown.\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  89\\nLarry\\nFa0/11\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1Fa0/12Archie\\nBobFa0/13DPDPDP\\nDPDP DP\\nRP\\n      \\n        – Designated PortRP\\nLegend:\\n        – Root Port\\nDPRP\\n– Blocking PortRoot\\nFigure 3-8 Network Topology for STP and RSTP Examples\\nThe first example focuses on VLAN 10, with all switches using 802.1D STP and the default \\nsetting of spanning-tree mode pvst . This setting creates an instance of STP per VLAN \\n(which is the per-VLAN part of the name) and uses 802.1D STP. Each switch places the port connected to the PC into VLAN 10 and enables both PortFast and BPDU Guard. Example 3-11 shows a sample configuration from switch SW3, with identical interface subcommands configured       on SW1’s F0/11 and SW2’s F0/12 ports, respectively.\\nExample 3-11 Sample Configuration from Switch SW3\\nSW3# show running-config interface Fastethernet 0/13\\nBuilding configuration...\\nCurrent configuration : 117 bytes\\n!\\ninterface FastEthernet0/13\\n switchport access vlan 10\\n spanning-tree portfast\\n spanning-tree bpduguard enable\\nend\\nAt this point, the three switches use 802.1D STP because all use the default PVST mode. \\nExample 3-12 shows the evidence of STP’s      work, with only subtle and indirect clues that STP happens to be in use.\\nptg1739636390  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 3-12 Output That Confirms the Use of 802.1D STP on Switch SW3\\nSW3# show spanning-tree vlan 10\\nVLAN0010\\n  Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee\\n  Root ID    Priority    32778\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.0e80\\nCost 4\\nPort 25 (GigabitEthernet0/1)\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\n  Bridge ID  Priority    32778  (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 10)\\nAddress     f47f.35cb.d780Hello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\nAging Time  300 sec\\nInterface           Role Sts Cost      Prio.Nbr Type\\n------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- --------------------------------\\nFa0/13 Desg FWD 19 128.13   P2p Edge \\nGi0/1 Root FWD 4 128.25   P2p \\nGi0/2 Altn BLK 4 128.26   P2p \\nSW3# show spanning-tree vlan 10 bridge\\nHello  Max  Fwd\\nVlan                         Bridge ID              Time  Age  Dly  Protocol---------------- --------------------------------- -----  ---  ---  --------\\nVLAN0010         32778 (32768,  10) f47f.35cb.d780    2    20   15  ieee  \\nThe highlighted parts of the example note the references to the STP protocol as ieee, which \\nimplies that STP is in use.

Example 3-14 repeats an excerpt from the \\nshow spanning-tree vlan 10  command on switch SW3 to \\nshow an example of the alternate port role. SW3 (as shown earlier in Figure 3-8) is not the root switch, with G0/1 as its root port and G0/2 as an alternate port. \\nExample 3-14 Output Confirming SW3’s Root Port and Alternate Port Roles\\nSW3# show spanning-tree vlan 10\\n!

The only trick is to know that Altn is a shortened ver-sion of the word \\nalternate .\\nptg1739636392  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPay close attention to this short description of an oddity about the STP and RSTP output \\non Catalyst switches! Cisco Catalyst switches often show the alternate and backup ports in output even when using STP and not RSTP. The alternate and backup port concepts are RSTP concepts. The switches only converge faster using these concepts when using RSTP. But \\nshow  command output, when using STP and not RSTP, happens to identify what would \\nbe the alternate and backup ports if RSTP were used.\\nWhy might you care about such trivia? Seeing output that lists an RSTP alternate port does \\nnot confirm that the switch is using RSTP. So, do not make that assumption on the exam. To confirm that a switch uses RSTP, you must look at the configuration of the \\nspanning-tree \\nmode  command, or look for the protocol as summarized back in Table 3-4.\\nFor instance, just compare the output of Example 3-12 and Example 3-14. Example 3-12 shows output for this same SW3, with the same parameters, except that all switches used PVST mode, meaning all the switches used STP. Example 3-12’s output (based on STP) lists SW3’s G0/2 as Altn, meaning alternate, even though the         alternate port concept is not an STP concept, but an RSTP concept. \\nRSTP Port States\\nRSTP added one new port state compared     to STP, discarding, using it as a replacement for the STP port states of disabled and blocking. You might think that after you configure a switch to use RSTP rather than STP, instead of seeing ports in a blocking state, you would now see the discarding state. However, the Cisco Catalyst switch output basically ignores the new term \\ndiscarding , continuing   to use the old term blocking  instead. \\nFor example, scan back to the most recent RSTP example (Example 3-14), to the line for SW3’s port G0/2. Then look for the column with heading STS, which refers to the status or state. The output shows G0/2 is listed as BLK, or blocking. In theory, because SW3 uses RSTP, the port state ought to be discarding, but the switch IOS continues to use the older notation of BLK for blocking.\\nJust as one more bit of evidence, the command   \\nshow spanning-tree vlan 10 interface \\ngigabitethernet0/2 state  lists the STP or RSTP port state with the state fully spelled out. \\nExample 3-15 shows this command, taken from SW3, for interface G0/2. Note the fully \\nspelled-out blocking  term instead of the RSTP term     discarding .\\nExample 3-15 SW3, an RSTP Switch, Continues to Use the Old Blocking Term\\nSW3# show spanning-tree vlan 10 interface gigabitEthernet 0/2 state  \\nVLAN0010            blocking\\nRSTP Port Types\\nCisco Catalyst switches determine the RSTP port type    based on two port settings: the cur-rent duplex (full or half) and whether the PortFast feature is enabled. First, full duplex tells the switch to use port type point-to-point, with half duplex telling the switch to use port type shared. Enabling PortFast tells the switch to treat the port as an edge port. Table 3-5 summarizes the combinations.\\nptg173963633Chapter 3: Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation  93\\nTable 3-5 RSTP Port Types\\nType Current Duplex Status Is Spanning-Tree PortFast Configured?\\nPoint-to-point Full No \\nPoint-to-point edge Full Y es \\nShared Half No \\nShared edge1Half Y es \\n1 Cisco recommends against using this combination, to avoid causing loops.\\nYou can easily find the RSTP port types in the output of several commands, including the \\nsame show spanning-tree  command in Example 3-16. Example 3-16 lists output from \\nswitch SW2, with a hub added off SW2’s F0/18 port (not shown in Figure 3-8). The hub was added so that the output in Example 3-16 lists a shared port (noted as Shr) to     go along with the point-to-point ports (noted as P2p).\\nExample 3-16 RSTP Port Types\\nSW2# show spanning-tree vlan 10\\nVLAN0010\\n  Spanning tree enabled protocol rstp\\n  Root ID    Priority    32778\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.0e80\\nCost 4\\nPort 26 (GigabitEthernet0/2)\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\n  Bridge ID  Priority    32778  (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 10)\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.1380Hello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\nAging Time  300 sec\\nInterface           Role Sts Cost      Prio.Nbr Type\\n------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- --------------------------------Fa0/12 Desg FWD 19 128.12   P2p Edge \\nFa0/18 Desg FWD 19 128.18   Shr \\nGi0/1 Desg FWD 4 128.25   P2p \\nGi0/2 Root FWD 4 128.26   P2p \\nFor exam prep, again note an odd fact about the highlighted output in Example 3-16: The \\nport type details appear in the output when using both STP and RSTP.

When thinking about configuration and verification, it helps to think about basic designs, learn how to configure the feature correctly, and learn how to verify the correct configuration is indeed working correctly. However, to learn how to troubleshoot, you need to think about symptoms when the design is incorrect, or if the configuration does not match the good design. What symptoms occur when you make one type of mistake or another? This chapter looks at the common types of mistakes, and works through how to look at the status with \\nshow  commands to \\nfind those mistakes.\\nThis chapter breaks the material into four major sections. The first section tackles the largest \\ntopic, STP troubleshooting. STP is not likely to fail as a protocol; instead, STP may not be \\nptg17396363operating as designed, so the task is to find how STP is currently working and discover how\\n \\nto then make the configuration implement the correct design. The second major section\\nthen moves on to Layer 2 EtherChannels, which have a variety of small potential problems\\n \\nthat can prevent the dynamic formation of an EtherChannel.\\nThe third major section of the chapter focuses on the data plane forwarding of Ethernet\\n \\nframes on LAN switches, in light of VLANs, trunks, STP, and EtherChannels. That same sec-\\n \\ntion reviews the Layer 2 forwarding logic of a switch in light of these features. The fourth\\n \\nand final major section then examines VLAN and trunking issues, and how those issues\\n \\nimpact switch forwarding.\\nNote that a few of the subtopics listed within the exam topics at the beginning of this chap-\\n \\nter are not discussed in this chapter. This chapter does not discuss VTP beyond its basic\\n \\nfeatures (VTP is discussed in depth in Chapter 5) or Layer 3 EtherChannels (discussed in\\n \\nChapter 19).\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nA few of the troubleshooting chapters in this book not only discuss troubleshooting of\\n \\nspecific topics but also serve as a tool to summarize and review some important topics. This\\n \\nchapter is one of those chapters. As a result, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of\\n \\nyour current knowledge level. Therefore, this chapter does not include a “Do I Know This\\n \\nAlready?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly confident about troubleshooting IPv4\\n \\nrouting features covered in this book, feel free to move to the “Chapter Review” section\\n \\nnear the end of this chapter to bypass the majority of the chapter. Technet24.ir\\nFoundation Topics\\nTroubleshooting STP\\nSTP questions tend to intimidate many test takers. STP uses many rules, with tiebreakers in\\n \\ncase one rule ends with a tie. Without much experience with STP, people tend to distrust\\n \\ntheir own answers. Also, even those of us with networking jobs already probably do not\\n \\ntroubleshoot STP very often, because STP works well. Often, troubleshooting STP is not\\n \\nabout STP failing to do its job but rather about STP working differently than designed, with\\n \\na different root switch, or different root ports (RP), and so on. Seldom does STP trouble-\\n \\nshooting begin with a case in which STP has failed to prevent a loop.\\nThis section reviews the rules for STP, while emphasizing some important troubleshooting\\n \\npoints. In particular, this section takes a closer look at the tiebreakers that STP uses to make\\n \\ndecisions. It also makes some practical suggestions about how to go about answering exam\\n \\nquestions such as “which switch is the root switch?”\\nDetermining the Root Switch\\nDetermining the STP root switch is easy if you know all the switches’ BIDs: Just pick the\\nlowest value. If the question lists the priority and MAC address separately, as is common in\\n \\nsome\\n \\nshow\\n \\ncommand output, pick the switch with the lowest priority, or in the case of a\\ntie, pick the lower MAC address value.\\nptg17396363100  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAnd just to be extra clear, STP does not have nor need a tiebreaker for electing the root \\nswitch. The BID uses a switch universal MAC address as the last 48 bits of the BID. These MAC addresses are unique in the universe, so there should never be identical BIDs or the need for a tiebreaker.\\nFor the exam, a question that asks about the root switch might not be so simple as listing \\na bunch of BIDs and asking you which one is “best.” A more likely question is a simulator (sim) question in which you have to do any \\nshow  commands you like or a multiple choice \\nquestion that lists the output from only one or two commands. Then you have to apply the STP algorithm to figure out the rest.\\nWhen faced with an exam question using a simulator, or just the output in an exhibit, use a \\nsimple strategy     of ruling out switches, as follows:\\nStep 1. Begin with a list or diagram of switches, and consider all as possible root \\nswitches.\\nStep 2. Rule out any switches that have an RP (\\nshow spanning-tree , show \\nspanning-tree root ), because root switches do not have an RP.\\nStep 3. Always try show spanning-tree , because it identifies the local switch as root \\ndirectly: “This switch is the root” on the fifth line of output.\\nStep 4. Always try show spanning-tree root , because it identifies the local switch as \\nroot indirectly: The RP column is empty if the local switch is the root.\\nStep 5. When using a sim, rather than try switches randomly, chase the RPs. For exam-\\nple, if starting with SW1, and SW1’s G0/1 is an RP, next try the switch on the \\nother end of SW1’s G0/1 port.\\nStep 6. When using a sim, use show spanning-tree vlan  x on a few switches and \\nrecord the root switch, RP, and designated port (DP). This strategy can quickly show you most STP facts.\\nThe one step in this list that most people ignore is the idea of ruling out switches that have \\nan RP. Root switches do not have an RP, so any switch with an RP can be ruled out as not being the root switch for that VLAN. Example 4-1 shows two commands on switch SW2 in some LAN that confirms that SW2 has an RP and is therefore          not the root switch.\\nExample 4-1 Ruling Out Switches as Root Based on Having a Root Port\\nSW2# show spanning-tree vlan 20 root\\nRoot Hello Max Fwd\\nVlan                   Root ID             Cost  Time Age Dly  Root Port\\n---------------- -------------------- --------- ----- --- ---  ------------VLAN0020         32788 1833.9d7b.0e80 4    2   20  15  Gi0/2  \\nSW2# show spanning-tree vlan 20\\nVLAN0020\\n  Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee\\n  Root ID    Priority    32788\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  101\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.0e80\\nCost 4\\nPort 26 (GigabitEthernet0/2)\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\n  Bridge ID  Priority    32788  (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 20)\\nAddress     1833.9d7b.1380\\nHello Time   2 sec  Max Age 20 sec  Forward Delay 15 sec\\nAging Time  15  sec\\nInterface           Role Sts Cost      Prio.Nbr Type\\n------------------- ---- --- --------- -------- --------------------------------\\nGi0/1 Desg FWD 4 128.25   P2p\\nGi0/2 Root FWD 4 128.26   P2p   \\nBoth commands identify SW2’s G0/2 port as its RP, so if you follow the suggestions, the \\nnext switch to try in a sim question          would be the switch on the other end of SW2’s G0/2 interface.\\nDetermining the Root Port on Nonroot Switches\\nDetermining the RP of a switch       when show  command output is available is relatively easy. \\nAs shown recently in Example 4-1, both show spanning-tree  and show spanning-tree \\nroot  list the root port of the local switch, assuming it is not the root switch. The challenge \\ncomes more when an exam question makes you think through how the switches choose the RP based on the root cost of each path to the root switch, with some tiebreakers as neces-sary.\\nAs a review, each nonroot switch has one, and only one, RP for a VLAN. To choose its RP, \\na switch listens for incoming Hello bridge protocol data units (BPDU). For each received Hello, the switch adds the cost listed in the hello BPDU to the cost of the incoming inter-face (the interface on which the Hello was received). That total is the root cost over that path. The lowest root cost wins, and the local switch uses its local port that is part of the least root cost path as its root port.\\nAlthough that description has a lot of twists and turns in the words, it is the same concept \\ndescribed for Chapter 2’s Figure 2-8.\\nMost humans can analyze what STP chooses by using a network diagram and a slightly dif-\\nferent algorithm. Instead of thinking about Hello messages and so on, approach the ques-tion as this: the sum of all outgoing port costs between the nonroot switch and the root. Repeating a familiar example, with a twist, Figure 4-1 shows the calculation of the root cost. Note that SW3’s Gi0/1 port has yet again had its cost       configured to a different value.\\nptg17396363102  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGi0/1Total\\nCost = 8TotalCost = 8\\nGi0/2Gi0/2SW2\\nSW3SW1\\nCost 4Cost 4\\nCost 8Root\\nSW1 Bridge ID32769:0200.0001.0001SW2 Bridge ID32769:0200.0002.0002\\nFigure 4-1 SW3’s Root Cost Calculation Ends in a Tie\\nSTP Tiebreakers When Choosing the Root Port\\nFigure 4-1 shows the easier process of adding the STP costs of the outgoing interfaces over \\neach from SW3, a nonroot, to SW1, the root. It also      shows a tie (on purpose), to talk about the tiebreakers.\\nWhen a switch chooses its root port, the first choice is to choose the local port that is part \\nof the least root cost path. When those costs tie, the switch picks the port connected to the neighbor with the lowest BID. This tiebreaker usually breaks the tie, but not always. So, for completeness, the three tiebreakers are, in the order a switch uses them, as follows:\\n1. Choose based on the lowest neighbor bridge ID.\\n2. Choose based on the lowest neighbor port priority.\\n3. Choose based on the lowest neighbor internal port number.\\n(Note that the switch only considers the root paths that tie when thinking about these tie-breakers.)\\nFor example, Figure 4-1 shows that SW3 is not root and that its two paths to reach the root \\ntie with their root costs of 8. The first tiebreaker is the lowest neighbor’s BID. SW1’s BID value is lower than SW2’s, so SW3 chooses its G0/1 interface as its RP in this case.\\nThe last two RP tiebreakers come into play only when two switches connect to each other \\nwith multiple links, as shown in Figure 4-2. In that case, a switch receives Hellos on more than one port from the same neighboring switch, so the BIDs tie.\\nFa0/14\\nFa0/15Fa0/16\\nFa0/17SW1 SW2Priority 112\\nPriority 128Cost 19\\nCost 19SW1 Bridge ID\\n32769:0211.1111.1111SW2 Bridge ID\\n32769:0200.0002.0002Root\\nFigure 4-2 Topology Required for the Last Two Tiebreakers for Root Port\\nIn this particular example, SW2 becomes root, and SW1 needs to choose its RP. SW1’s port \\ncosts tie, at 19 each, so SW1’s root cost over each path will tie at 19. SW2 sends Hellos over \\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  103\\neach link to SW1, so SW1 cannot break the tie based on SW1’s neighbor BID because both \\nlist SW2’s BID. So, SW1 has to turn to the      other two tiebreakers.\\nNOTE In real life, most engineers would put these two links into an EtherChannel.\\nThe next tiebreaker is a configurable option: the neighboring switch’s port priority on each neighboring switch interface. Cisco switch ports default to a setting of 128, with a range of values from 0 through 255, with lower being better (as usual). In this example, the network engineer has set SW2’s F0/16 interface with the   \\nspanning-tree vlan 10 port-priority 112  \\ncommand. SW1 learns that the neighbor has a port priority of 112 on the top link and 128 on the bottom, so SW1 uses its top (F0/14) interface as the root port.\\nIf the port priority ties, which it often does due to the default values, STP relies on an inter-\\nnal port numbering on the neighbor. Cisco switches assign an internal integer to identify each interface on the switch. The nonroot looks for the neighbor’s lowest internal port num-ber (as listed in the Hello messages) and chooses its RP based on the lower number.\\nCisco switches use an obvious numbering, with Fa0/1 having the lowest number, then Fa0/2, \\nthen Fa0/3, and so on. So, in Figure 4-2, SW2’s Fa0/16 would have a lower internal port number than Fa0/17; SW1 would learn those numbers            in the Hello; and SW1 would use its Fa0/14 port as its RP.\\nSuggestions for Attacking Root Port Problems on the Exam\\nExam questions that make you think about the RP can be easy if you know where to look and the output of a few key commands is available. However, the more conceptual the question, the more you have to calculate the root cost over each path, correlate that to dif-ferent \\nshow  commands, and put the ideas together. The following    list makes a few sugges-\\ntions about how to approach STP problems on the exam:\\n1. If available, look at the show spanning-tree and show spanning-tree root commands.\\nBoth commands list the root port and the root cost (see Example 4-1).\\n2. The show spanning-tree command lists cost in two places: the root cost at the top,\\nin the section about the root switch; and the interface cost, at the bottom, in the per-\\ninterface section. Be careful, though; the cost at the bottom is the interface cost, notthe root cost!\\n3. For problems where you have to calculate a switch’s root cost:\\na. Memorize the default cost values: 100 for 10 Mbps, 19 for 100 Mbps, 4 for\\n1 Gbps, and 2 for 10 Gbps.\\nb. Look for any evidence of the spanning-tree cost configuration command on an\\ninterface, because it overrides the default cost. Do not assume default costs areused.\\nc. When you know a default cost is used, if you can, check the current actual speed\\nas well. Cisco switches choose STP cost defaults based on the          current speed, notthe maximum speed.\\nptg17396363104  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nDetermining the Designated Port on Each LAN Segment\\nEach LAN segment has a single switch       that acts as the designated port (DP) on that segment. \\nOn segments that connect a switch to a device that does not even use STP—for example, segments connecting a switch to a PC or a router—the switch always wins, because it is the only device sending a Hello onto the link. However, links with two switches require a little more work to discover which should be the DP. By definition:\\nStep 1.\\n For switches connected to the same LAN segment, the switch with the low-\\nest cost to reach the root, as advertised in the Hello they send onto the link, becomes the DP on that link.\\nStep 2. In case of a tie, among the switches that tied on cost, the switch with the low-est BID becomes the DP.\\nFor example, consider Figure 4-3. This figure notes the root, RPs, and DPs and each switch’s \\nleast cost to reach       the root over its respective RP.\\nFa0/3Fa0/4\\nFa0/2\\nFa0/4\\nFa0/3Fa0/1Fa0/2Fa0/4Fa0/3Fa0/1Fa0/2\\nFa0/1\\nSW2 SW3\\nSW4SW1\\nBID:\\n28,682:0200.2222.2222\\nRoot Cost: 20BID:32,778:0200.3333.3333\\nRoot Cost: 19\\nBID:32,778:0200.4444.4444\\nRoot Cost: 19Root\\nRP RP\\nRP\\nDPDP\\nDPDP\\nDPDP\\nCost = 20Interface\\nFigure 4-3 Picking the DPs\\nFocus on the segments that connect the nonroot switches for a moment:\\nSW2–SW4 segment: SW4 wins because of its root cost of 19, compared to SW2’s root \\ncost of 20.\\nSW2–SW3 segment: SW3 wins because of its root cost of 19, compared to SW2’s root \\ncost of 20.\\nSW3–SW4 segment: SW3 and SW4 tie on root cost, both with root cost 19. SW3 wins \\ndue to its better (lower) BID value.\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  105\\nInterestingly, SW2 loses and does not become DP on the links to SW3 and SW4 even \\nthough SW2 has the better (lower) BID value. The DP tiebreaker does use the lowest BID, but the first DP criteria is the lowest root cost, and SW2’s       root cost happens to be higher than SW3’s and SW4’s.\\nNOTE A single switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain, and compete to become DP, if hubs are used. In such cases, two different switch ports on the same switch tie, the DP choice uses the same two final tiebreakers as used with the RP selection: the lowest interface STP priority, and if that ties, the lowest internal interface number.\\nSuggestions for Attacking Designated Port Problems on the Exam\\nAs with exam questions asking about the RP, exam questions that make you think about the DP can be easy if you know where to look and the output of a few key commands is avail-able. However, the more conceptual the question, the more you have to think about the cri-teria for choosing the DP: first the root cost    of the competing switches, and then the better BID if they tie based on root cost.\\nThe following list gives some tips to keep in mind when digging into a given DP issue. Some \\nof this list repeats the suggestions for finding the RP, but to be complete, this list includes each idea as well.\\n1. If available, look at the show spanning-tree commands, at the list of interfaces at the\\nend of the output. Then, look for the Role column, and look for Desg, to identify any\\nDPs.\\n2. Identify the root cost of a switch directly by using the show spanning-tree command.But be careful! This command lists the cost in two places, and only the mention at thetop, in the section about the root, lists the root cost.\\n3. For problems where you have to calculate a switch’s root cost, do the following:\\na.  Memor ize the default cost values: 100 for 10 Mbps, 19 for 100 Mbps, 4 for\\n1 Gbps, and 2 for 10 Gbps.\\nb.  Look for any evidence of the spanning-tree cost conﬁ  guration command on aninterface, because it overrides the default cost. Do not assume default costs areused.\\nc. When you know a default cost is used, if you can, check the current actual speedas well. Cisco switches choose STP cost defaults based on the current speed, notthe maximum speed.\\nSTP Convergence\\nSTP puts each RP and DP into       a forwarding state, and ports that are neither RP nor DP into \\na blocking state. Those states may remain as is for days, weeks, or months. But at some point, some switch or link will fail, a link may change speeds (changing the STP cost), or the STP configuration may change. Any of these events can cause switches to repeat their STP algorithm, which may in turn change their own RP and any ports that are DPs.\\nptg17396363106  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhen STP converges based on some change, not all the ports have to change their state. For \\ninstance, a port that was forwarding, if it still needs to forward, just keeps on forwarding. Ports that were blocking that still need to block keep on blocking. But when a port needs to change state, something has to happen, based on the following rules:\\n■For interfaces that stay in the same STP state, nothing needs to change.\\n■For interfaces that need to move from a forwarding state to a blocking state, the switch\\nimmediately changes the state to blocking.\\n■For interfaces that need to move from a blocking state to a forwarding state, the switch\\nfirst moves the interface to listening state, then learning state, each for the time specified\\nby the forward delay timer (default 15 seconds). Only then is the interface       placed intoforwarding state.\\nBecause the transition from blocking to forwarding does require some extra steps, you \\nshould be ready to respond to conceptual questions about the transition. To be ready, review the section “Reacting to State Changes That Affect the STP Topology” in Chapter 2.\\nTroubleshooting Layer 2 EtherChannel\\nEtherChannels can     prove particularly challenging to troubleshoot for a couple of reasons. First, you have to be careful to match the correct configuration, and there are many more incorrect configuration combinations than there are correct combinations. Second, many interface settings must match on the physical links, both on the local switch and on the neighboring switch, before a switch will add the physical link to the channel. This second major section in the chapter works through both sets of issues.\\nIncorrect Options on the channel-group Command\\nIn Chapter 3, the section titled “Configuring EtherChannel” listed the small set of working configuration options     on the \\nchannel-group  command. Those rules can be summarized as \\nfollows, for a single EtherChannel:\\n1. On the local switch, all the channel-group commands for all the physical interfaces\\nmust use the same channel-group number.\\n2. The channel-group number can be different on the neighboring switches.\\n3. If using the on keyword, you must use it on the corresponding interfaces of both\\nswitches.\\n4. If you use the desirable keyword on one switch, the switch uses PAgP; the other\\nswitch must use either desirable or auto.\\n5. If you use the active keyword on one switch, the switch uses LACP; the other switch\\nmust use either active or passive.\\nThese rules summarize the correct configuration options, but the options actually leave \\nmany more incorrect choices. The following list shows some incorrect configurations that the switches allow, even though they would result in the EtherChannel not working. The list compares the configuration on one switch to another based on the physical interface con-figuration. Each lists the reasons why the configuration is incorrect.\\n■Configuring the on keyword on one switch, and desirable , auto , active , or passive  on\\nthe other switch. The on keyword does not enable PAgP, and does not enable LACP,\\nand the other options rely on PAgP or LACP.\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  107\\n■Configuring the auto  keyword on both switches. Both use PAgP, but both wait on the\\nother switch to begin negotiations.\\n■Configuring the passive  keyword on both switches. Both use LACP, but both wait on\\nthe other switch to begin negotiations.\\n■Configuring the active  keyword on one switch and either desirable  or auto  on the\\nother switch. The active  keyword uses LACP, whereas the other keywords use PAgP.\\n■Configuring the desirable  keyword on one switch and either active  or passive  on the\\nother switch. The desirable  keyword uses PAgP, whereas the other keywords use LACP.\\nExample 4-2 shows an example that matches the last item in the list. In this case, SW1’s \\ntwo ports (F0/14 and F0/15) have been configured with the desirable  keyword, and SW2’s \\nmatching F0/16 and F0/17 have been configured with the active  keyword. The example \\nlists some telling status information about the failure, with     notes following the example.\\nExample 4-2 Incorrect Configuration Using Mismatched PortChannel Protocols\\nSW1# show etherchannel summary\\nFlags:  D - down        P - bundled in port-channel\\nI - stand-alone s - suspended\\nH - Hot-standby (LACP only)\\nR - Layer3      S - Layer2\\nU - in use      f - failed to allocate aggregator\\nM - not in use, minimum links not met\\nu - unsuitable for bundling\\nw - waiting to be aggregated\\nd - default port\\nNumber of channel-groups in use: 1\\nNumber of aggregators: 1\\nGroup  Port-channel  Protocol    Ports\\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------\\n1 Po1(SD) PAgP Fa0/14(I)   Fa0/15(I)   \\nSW1# show interfaces status | include Po|14|15    \\nPort      Name               Status       Vlan Duplex  Speed Type\\nFa0/14 connected    301 a-full  a-100 10/100BaseTX\\nFa0/15 connected    301 a-full  a-100 10/100BaseTX\\nPo1 notconnect   unassigned   auto   auto   \\nStart at the top, in the legend of the   show etherchannel summary  command.

The last command in the example shows that while the PortChannel 1 interface     is down, the two physical interfaces are in a connected state.\\nNOTE As a suggestion for attacking EtherChannel problems on the exam, rather than memorizing all the incorrect configuration options, concentrate on the list of correct con-figuration options. Then look for any differences between a given question’s configuration as compared to the known correct configurations and work from there.\\nConfiguration Checks Before Adding Interfaces to EtherChannels\\nEven when the channel-group  commands     have all been configured correctly, other con-\\nfiguration settings can cause problems as well. This last topic examines those configuration settings and their impact.\\nFirst, a local switch checks each new physical interface that is configured to be part of an \\nEtherChannel, comparing each new link to the existing links. That new physical interface’s settings must be the same as the existing links’ settings; otherwise, the switch does not add the new link to the list of approved and working interfaces in the channel. That is, the physi-cal interface remains configured as part of the PortChannel, but it is not used as part of the channel, often being placed into some nonworking state.\\nThe list of items the switch checks includes the following:\\n■Speed\\n■Duplex\\n■Operational access or trunking state (all must be access, or all must be trunks)\\n■If an access port, the access VLAN\\n■If a trunk port, the allowed VLAN list (per the switchport trunk allowed  command)\\n■If a trunk port, the native VLAN\\n■STP interface settings\\nIn addition, switches check the settings on the neighboring switch. To do so, the switches \\neither use PAgP or LACP (if already in use), or use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) if using manual configuration. The neighbor must match on all parameters in this list except the STP settings.\\nAs an example, SW1 and SW2 again use two links in one EtherChannel. Before configuring \\nthe EtherChannel, SW1’s F0/15 was given a different STP port cost than F0/14. Example 4-3 picks up the story just after configuring the correct \\nchannel-group  commands, when \\nthe switch is deciding whether to use F0/14 and F0/15 in this     EtherChannel.\\nExample 4-3 Local Interfaces Fail in EtherChannel Because of Mismatched STP Cost\\n*Mar  1 23:18:56.132: %PM-4-ERR_DISABLE: channel-misconfig (STP) error detected on\\n  Po1, putting Fa0/14 in err-disable state\\n*Mar  1 23:18:56.132: %PM-4-ERR_DISABLE: channel-misconfig (STP) error detected on\\n  Po1, putting Fa0/15 in err-disable state\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  109\\n*Mar  1 23:18:56.132: %PM-4-ERR_DISABLE: channel-misconfig (STP) error detected on\\n  Po1, putting Po1 in err-disable state\\n*Mar  1 23:18:58.120: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface FastEthernet0/14, changed state to\\n  down\\n*Mar  1 23:18:58.137: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Port-channel1, changed state to down\\n*Mar  1 23:18:58.137: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface FastEthernet0/15, changed state to\\n  down\\nSW1# show etherchannel summary\\nFlags:  D - down P - bundled in port-channel\\nI - stand-alone s - suspended\\nH - Hot-standby (LACP only)\\nR - Layer3 S - Layer2\\nU - in use f - failed to allocate aggregator\\nM - not in use, minimum links not met\\nu - unsuitable for bundling\\nw - waiting to be aggregated\\nd - default port\\nNumber of channel-groups in use: 1Number of aggregators: 1\\nGroup  Port-channel  Protocol    Ports\\n------+-------------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------\\n1 Po1(SD) - Fa0/14(D)   Fa0/15(D)   \\nThe messages at the top of the example specifically state what the switch does when \\ndetermining whether the interface settings match. In this case, SW1 detects the different STP costs. SW1 does not use F0/14, does not use F0/15, and even places them into an err-disabled state. The switch also puts the PortChannel into err-disabled state. As a result, the PortChannel is not operational, and the physical interfaces are also not operational.\\nTo solve this problem, you must reconfigure the physical interfaces to use the same STP \\nsettings. In addition, the PortChannel and physical interfaces must be \\nshutdown , and then \\nno shutdown , to recover from the err-disabled state. (Note that when a switch applies \\nthe shutdown  and no shutdown  commands to a PortChannel, it applies     those same com-\\nmands to the physical interfaces, as well; so, just do the shutdown /no shutdown  on the \\nPortChannel interface.)\\nAnalyzing the Switch Data Plane Forwarding\\nSTP and EtherChannel both have an impact on what a switch’s forwarding logic can use. STP limits which interfaces the data plane even considers using by placing some ports in a block-ing state (STP) or discarding state (RSTP), which in turn tells the data plane to simply not use that port. EtherChannel gives the data plane new ports to use in the switch’s MAC address table—EtherChannels—while telling the data plane to not use the underlying physical inter-faces in an EtherChannel in the MAC table.\\nptg17396363110  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThis (short) third major section of the chapter explores the impact of STP and EtherChannel \\non data plane logic and a switch’s MAC address table. \\nPredicting STP Impact on MAC Tables\\nConsider the small LAN shown       in Figure 4-4. The LAN has only three switches, with redun-dancy, just big enough to make the point for this next example. The LAN supports two VLANs, 1 and 2, and the engineer has configured STP such that SW3 blocks on a different port in each of the two VLANs. As a result, VLAN 1 traffic would flow from SW3 to SW1 next, and in VLAN 2, traffic would flow from SW3 to SW2 next instead.\\nGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1Root\\nGi0/3A0200.AAAA.AAAAGi0/1Gi0/1\\nGi0/2Gi0/2\\nSW2\\nSW3Gi0/1\\nGi0/2SW1RootVLAN 2 STP Topology VLAN 1 STP Topology\\nGi0/3B0200.BBBB.BBBB\\nFigure 4-4 Two Different STP Topologies for Same Physical LAN, Two Different VLANs\\nLooking at diagrams like those in Figure 4-4 makes the forwarding path obvious. Although the figure shows the traffic path, that path is determined by switch MAC learning, which is then impacted by the ports on which STP has set a blocking or discarding state. \\nFor example, consider VLAN 1’s STP topology in Figure 4-4. Remember, STP blocks on a \\nport on one switch, not on both ends of the link. So, in the case of VLAN 1, SW3’s G0/2 port blocks, but SW2’s G0/1 does not. Even so, by blocking on a port on one end of the link, that act effectively stops any MAC learning from happening by either device on the link. That is, SW3 learns no MAC addresses on its G0/2 port, and SW2 learns no MAC addresses on its G0/1 port, for these reasons:\\n■SW2 learns no MAC addresses on G0/1: On the blocking (SW3) end of the SW3–SW2\\ntrunk, SW3 will not send frames out that link to SW2, so SW2 will never receive framesfrom which to learn MAC addresses on SW2’s G0/1.\\n■SW3 learns no MAC addresses on G0/2: On the not blocking (SW2) end of theSW3–SW2 trunk, SW2 will flood frames out that port. SW3 receives those frames, butbecause SW3 blocks, SW3 ignores those received frames and does not learn their MACaddresses.\\nGiven that discussion, can you predict the MAC table entries on each of the three switches \\nfor the MAC addresses of servers A and B in Figure 4-4? On switch SW2, the entry for server A, in VLAN 1, should refer to SW2’s G0/2 port, pointing to SW1 next, matching the figure. But SW2’s entry for server B, in VLAN 2, references SW2’s G0/1 port, again match-ing the figure. Example 4-4 shows the MAC       tables on SW1 and SW2 as a confirmation.\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  111\\nExample 4-4 Examining SW1 and SW2 Dynamic MAC Address Table Entries\\nSW1# show mac address-table dynamic\\nMac Address Table\\n-------------------------------------------\\nVlan    Mac Address Type Ports\\n----    ----------- --------    -----\\n  1     0200.AAAA.AAAA    DYNAMIC     Gi0/2\\n  2     0200.BBBB.BBBB    DYNAMIC     Gi0/1\\nSW2# show mac address-table dynamic\\nMac Address Table\\n-------------------------------------------\\nVlan    Mac Address Type Ports\\n----    ----------- --------    -----\\n  1     0200.AAAA.AAAA    DYNAMIC     Gi0/2\\n  2     0200.BBBB.BBBB    DYNAMIC     Gi0/1\\nPredicting EtherChannel Impact on MAC Tables\\nMost designs use multiple links between switches, with those links configured to be part of \\nan EtherChannel. What does that do to the MAC forwarding logic? In short, the switch uses the PortChannel interfaces, and not the physical interfaces bundled       into the EtherChannel, in the MAC address table. Specifically:\\nMAC learning: Frames received in a physical interface that is part of a PortChannel \\nare considered to  arrive on the PortChannel interface. So, MAC learning adds the PortChannel interface rather than the physical interface to the MAC address table.\\nMAC forwarding: The forwarding process  will find a PortChannel port as an outgoing \\ninterface when matching the MAC address table. Then the switch must take the addition-al step to choose the outgoing physical interface, based on the load-balancing preferences configured for that PortChannel.\\nFor example, consider Figure 4-5, which updates previous Figure 4-4 with two-link \\nPortChannels between each pair of switches. With VLAN 1 blocking again on switch SW3, but this time on SW3’s PortChannel3 interface, what MAC table entries would you expect to see in each switch? Similarly, what MAC table entries would you expect to see for VLAN 2, with SW3 blocking on its PortChannel2 interface?\\nThe logic of which entries exist on which ports mirrors the logic with the earlier example \\nsurrounding Figure 4-4. In this case, the interfaces just happen to be PortChannel interfaces. Example 4-5 shows the same command from the same two switches as Example 4-4: \\nshow \\nmac address-table dynamic  from   both SW1 and SW2. (Note that to save length, the \\nMAC table output shows only the entries for the two servers       in Figure 4-5.)\\nptg17396363112  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPo2Po3\\nPo3Po1\\nSW2\\nSW3Po1\\nPo2SW1Root\\nGi0/3A0200.AAAA.AAAARootVLAN 2 STP Topology VLAN 1 STP Topology\\nPo2Po3\\nPo3Po1\\nSW2\\nSW3Po1\\nPo2SW1\\nB0200.BBBB.BBBB\\nFigure 4-5 VLAN Topology with PortChannels Between Switches\\nExample 4-5 SW1 and SW2 MAC Tables with PortChannel Ports Listed\\nSW1# show mac address-table dynamic\\nMac Address Table\\n-------------------------------------------\\nVlan    Mac Address Type Ports\\n----    ----------- --------    -----\\n  1     0200.AAAA.AAAA    DYNAMIC     Po2\\n  2     0200.BBBB.BBBB    DYNAMIC     Po1\\nSW2# show mac address-table dynamic\\nMac Address Table\\n-------------------------------------------\\nVlan    Mac Address Type Ports\\n----    ----------- --------    -----\\n  1     0200.AAAA.AAAA    DYNAMIC     Po1\\n  2     0200.BBBB.BBBB    DYNAMIC     Po3\\nSwitches use one of many load-balancing options to then choose the physical interface \\nto use after matching MAC table entries like those shown in Example 4-5. By default, Cisco Layer 2 switches often default to use a balancing method based on the source MAC address. In particular, the switch looks at the low-order bits of the source MAC address (which are on the far right of the MAC address in written form). This approach increases the chances that the balancing will be spread somewhat evenly based on the source       MAC addresses in use.\\nChoosing the VLAN of Incoming Frames\\nTo wrap up the analysis        of switch data plane forwarding, this section mostly reviews top-ics already discussed, but it serves to emphasize some important points. The topic is simply this: How does a switch know which VLAN a frame is a part of as the frame enters a switch? You have seen all the information needed to answer this question already, but take the time to review.\\nFirst, some interfaces trunk, and in those cases, the frame arrives with a VLAN ID listed \\nin the incoming trunking header. In other cases, the frame does not arrive with a trunking \\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  113\\nheader, and the switch must look at local configuration. But because the switch will match \\nboth the destination MAC address and the frame VLAN ID when matching the MAC address table, knowing how the switch determines the VLAN ID is important.\\nThe following list reviews and summarizes the key points of how a switch determines the \\nVLAN ID to associate with an incoming frame:\\nStep 1. If the port is an access port, associate the frame with the configured access \\n  VLAN (switchport access vlan vlan_id). \\nStep 2. If the port is a voice port, or has both an IP Phone and PC (or other data device) connected to the phone:\\nA. Associate the frames from the data device with the configured access \\nVLAN (as configured with the switchport access vlan vlan_id com-\\nmand).\\nB. Associate the frames from the phone with the VLAN ID in the 802.1Q \\nheader (as configured with the switchport voice vlan vlan_id com-\\nmand).\\nStep 3. If the port is a trunk, determine the frame’s tagged VLAN, or if there is no tag, use that incoming interface’s native        VLAN ID (switchport trunk native vlan_id).\\nTroubleshooting VLANs and VLAN Trunks\\nA switch’s data plane forwarding processes depend in part on VLANs and VLAN trunk-\\ning. Before a switch can forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must know about a VLAN and the VLAN must be active. And before a switch can forward a frame over a VLAN trunk, the trunk must currently allow that VLAN to pass over the trunk. \\nThis final major section in this chapter focuses on VLAN and VLAN trunking issues, specifi-\\ncally issues that impact the frame switching      process. The issues are as follows:\\nStep 1. Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs and reassign into \\nthe correct VLANs if incorrect.\\nStep 2. Determine whether the VLANs both exist (either configured or learned with the VLAN Trunking Protocol [VTP]) and are active on each switch. If not, con-figure and activate the VLANs to resolve problems as needed.\\nStep 3. Check the allowed VLAN lists, on the switches on both ends of the trunk, and ensure that the lists of allowed VLANs are the same.\\nStep 4. Check for incorrect configuration settings that result in one switch operating as a trunk, with the neighboring switch not operating as a trunk.\\nStep 5. Check the allowed VLANs on each trunk, to make sure that the trunk has not administratively removed a VLAN      from being supported on a trunk.\\nAccess VLAN Configuration Incorrect\\nTo ensure that each access interface     has been assigned to the correct VLAN, engineers \\nsimply need to determine which switch interfaces are access interfaces instead of trunk \\nptg17396363114  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ninterfaces, determine the assigned access VLANs on each interface, and compare the infor-\\nmation to the documentation. The show  commands listed in Table 4-1 can be particularly \\nhelpful in this process.\\nTable 4-1 Commands That Can Find A ccess Por ts and VLANs\\nEXEC Command Description\\nshow vlan brief\\nshow vlanLists each VLAN and all interfaces assigned to that VLAN (but \\ndoes not include operational trunks)\\nshow vlan id  num Lists both access and trunk ports in the VLAN\\nshow interfaces  type \\nnumber  switchportIdentifies the interface’s access VLAN and voice VLAN, plus the configured and operational mode (access or trunk)\\nshow mac address-table Lists MAC table entries, including the associated VLAN\\nIf possible, start this step with the     show vlan  and show vlan brief  commands, because \\nthey list all the known VLANs and the access interfaces assigned to each VLAN. Be aware, \\nhowever, that these two commands do not list operational trunks. The output does list all other interfaces (those not currently trunking), no matter whether the interface is in a work-ing or nonworking state.\\nIf the \\nshow vlan  and show interface switchport  commands       are not available in a par-\\nticular exam question, the show mac address-table  command can also help identify the \\naccess VLAN. This command lists the MAC address table, with each entry including a MAC \\naddress, interface, and VLAN ID. If the exam question implies that a switch interface con-nects to a single device, you should only see one MAC table entry that lists that particular access interface; the VLAN ID listed for that same entry identifies the access VLAN. (You cannot make such assumptions for trunking interfaces.)\\nAfter you determine the access interfaces and     associated VLANs, if the interface is assigned \\nto the wrong VLAN, use the \\nswitchport access vlan  vlan-id  interface subcommand to \\nassign the correct VLAN ID.\\nAccess VLANs Undefined or Disabled\\nSwitches do not forward     frames for VLANs that are (a) not known because the VLAN is not configured or has not been learned with VTP or (b) the VLAN is known, but it is disabled (shut down). This section summarizes the best ways to confirm that a switch knows that a particular VLAN exists, and if it exists, determines the shutdown state of the VLAN.\\nFirst, on the issue of whether a VLAN exists on a switch, a VLAN can be defined to a \\nswitch in two ways: using the \\nvlan  number  global configuration command, or it can be \\nlearned from another switch using VTP. Chapter 5, “VLAN Trunking Protocol,” discusses VTP and how VTP can be used by a switch to learn about VLANs. For this discussion, consider that the only way for a switch to know about a VLAN is to have a \\nvlan  command \\nconfigured on the local switch.\\nNext, the show vlan  command always lists all VLANs known to the switch, but the show \\nrunning-config  command does not. Switches configured as VTP servers and clients do \\nnot list the vlan  commands in the running-config file nor the startup-config file; on these \\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  115\\nswitches, you must use the show vlan  command. Switches configured to use VTP transpar-\\nent mode, or that disable VTP, list the vlan  configuration commands in the configuration \\nfiles. (Use the show vtp status  command to learn the current VTP mode of a switch.)\\nAfter you determine that a VLAN does not exist on a switch, the problem might be that the \\nVLAN simply needs to be configured. If so, follow the VLAN configuration process as cov-ered in detail in Chapter 1.\\nEven for existing VLANs, you must also verify whether the VLAN is active. The \\nshow \\nvlan  command should list one of two VLAN state values, depending on the current state: \\neither active  or act/lshut . The second of these states means that the VLAN is shut down. \\nShutting down a VLAN disables the VLAN on that switch only, so that the switch will not \\nforward frames in that VLAN .\\nSwitch IOS gives you two similar configuration methods with which to disable ( shutdown ) \\nand enable ( no shutdown ) a VLAN. Example 4-6 shows how, first by using the global com-\\nmand [ no] shutdown vlan  number  and then using the VLAN mode subcommand [ no] \\nshutdown . The example shows the global commands         enabling and disabling VLANs 10 and \\n20, respectively, and using VLAN subcommands to enable and disable VLANs 30 and 40 \\n(respectively).\\nExample 4-6 Enabling and Disabling VLANs on a Switch\\nSW2# show vlan brief\\nVLAN Name                             Status    Ports\\n---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------1    default active    Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4\\nFa0/5, Fa0/6, Fa0/7, Fa0/8Fa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11, Fa0/12Fa0/14, Fa0/15, Fa0/16, Fa0/17Fa0/18, Fa0/19, Fa0/20, Fa0/21Fa0/22, Fa0/23, Fa0/24, Gi0/1\\n10   VLAN0010 act/lshut Fa0/13\\n20   VLAN0020 active    \\n30   VLAN0030 act/lshut\\n40   VLAN0040 active  \\nSW2# configure terminalEnter configuration commands, one per line.

However, trunks can also be misconfigured, with a couple of different results. In some cases, both switches conclude that their interfaces do not trunk. In other cases, one switch believes that its interface is correctly trunking, while the other switch does not.\\nThe most common incorrect configuration—which results in both switches not trunking—is \\na configuration that uses the   \\nswitchport mode dynamic auto  command on both switches \\non the link. The word “auto” just makes us all want to think that the link would trunk auto-matically, but this command is both automatic and passive. As a result, both switches pas-sively wait on the other device on the link to begin negotiations.\\nWith this particular incorrect configuration, the \\nshow interfaces switchport  command   on \\nboth switches confirms both the administrative state (auto) and the fact that both switches \\noperate as “static access” ports. Example 4-7 highlights those parts of the output from this command.\\nExample 4-7 Operational Trunking State\\nSW2# show interfaces gigabit0/2 switchport\\nName: Gi0/2\\nSwitchport: Enabled\\nAdministrative Mode: dynamic auto\\nOperational Mode: static access\\nAdministrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q\\nOperational Trunking Encapsulation: native\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nA different incorrect trunking configuration results in one switch with an operational state \\nof “trunk,” while the other switch has an operational state of “static access.” When this com-bination of events happens, the interface works a little. The status on each end will be up/up or connected. Traffic in the native VLAN will actually cross the link successfully. However, traffic in all the rest of the VLANs will not cross the link.\\nFigure 4-6 shows the incorrect configuration along with which side trunks and which does \\nnot. The side that trunks (SW1 in this case) enables trunking always, using the command   \\nswitchport mode trunk . However, this command does not disable Dynamic Trunking \\nProtocol (DTP) negotiations. To cause this particular problem, SW1 also disables DTP nego-tiation using the \\nswitchport nonegotiate         command. SW2’s configuration also helps create \\nthe problem, by using a trunking option that relies on DTP. Because SW1 has    disabled DTP, SW2’s DTP negotiations fail, and SW2 does not trunk.\\nIn this case, SW1 treats its G0/1 interface as a trunk, and SW2 treats its G0/2 interface as an \\naccess port (not a trunk). As shown in the figure at Step 1, SW1 could (for example) forward a frame in VLAN 10. However, SW2 would view any frame that arrives with an 802.1Q header as illegal, because SW2 treats its G0/2 port as an access port. So, SW2 discards any 802.1Q frames received on that port.\\nTo deal with the possibility of this problem, always check the trunk’s operational state \\non both sides of the trunk. The best commands to check trunking-related        facts are \\nshow \\ninterfaces trunk  and show interfaces switchport .\\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  117\\nGi0/1 Gi0/2\\nswitchport mode trunk\\nswitchport nonegotiateswitchport mode dynamic desirableSW1 SW2Frame has 802.1Q: Discard!\\nVLAN 10 Eth.

However, the switches do \\nnot prevent you from making these types of mistakes, so you need to be ready. Note that Chapter 1’s Table 1-3 summarizes the list of options on the \\nswitchport trunk  command, \\nwhich combinations work, and which ones to completely avoid (like the combination shown here in Figure 4-6.)\\nMismatched Supported VLAN List on Trunks \\nVLAN trunks on Cisco switches    can forward traffic for all defined and active VLANs. However, a particular trunk may not forward traffic for a defined and active VLAN for a variety of other reasons. You should know how to identify which VLANs a particular trunk port currently supports, and the reasons why the switch might not be forwarding frames for a VLAN on that trunk port.\\nThe first category in this step can be easily done using the   \\nshow interfaces trunk  com-\\nmand, which only lists information about currently operational trunks. The best place to \\nbegin with this command is the last section of output, which lists the VLANs whose traffic will be forwarded over the trunk. Any VLANs that make it to this final list of VLANs in the command output meet the following criteria:\\n■The VLAN exists and is active on the local switch (as seen in the show vlan  command).\\n■The VLAN has not been removed from the allowed VLAN list  on the trunk (as config-\\nured with the   switchport trunk allowed vlan  interface subcommand).\\n■The VLAN has not been VTP-pruned from the trunk. (This is a VTP feature, discussed\\nin Chapter 5, which this section will now otherwise ignore, deferring discussion until\\nChapter 5. It is only listed here because the show  command output mentions it.)\\n■The trunk is in an STP forwarding state in that VLAN (as also seen in the show\\nspanning-tree vlan  vlan-id  command).\\nExample 4-8 shows a sample of the command output from the show interfaces trunk  \\ncommand, with the final section of the command    output shaded. In this case, the trunk only \\nforwards traffic in VLANs 1 and 4.\\nptg17396363118  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 4-8 Allowed VLAN List and List of Active VLANs\\nSW1# show interfaces trunk\\nPort Mode Encapsulation  Status Native vlan\\nGi0/1 desirable    802.1q trunking 1\\nPort Vlans allowed on trunk\\nGi0/1 1-2,4-4094\\nPort Vlans allowed and active in management domain\\nGi0/1 1,4\\nPort Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned\\nGi0/1 1,4\\nThe absence of a VLAN in this last part of the command’s output does not necessarily mean \\nthat a problem has occurred. In fact, a VLAN might be legitimately excluded from a trunk for any of the reasons in the list just before Example 4-8. However, for a given exam ques-tion, it can be useful to know why traffic for a VLAN will not be forwarded over a trunk, and the details inside the output identify the specific reasons.\\nThe output of the \\nshow interfaces trunk  command creates three separate lists of VLANs, \\neach under a separate heading. These three lists show a progression of reasons why a VLAN \\nis not forwarded over a trunk. Table 4-2    summarizes the headings that precede each list and the reasons why a switch chooses to include or not include a VLAN in each list.\\nTable 4-2 VLAN Lists in the show interfaces trunk Command\\nList \\nPositionHeading Reasons\\nFirst VLANs allowed VLANs 1–4094, minus those removed by the switchport trunk \\nallowed  command \\nSecond VLANs allowed \\nand active…The first list, minus VLANs not defined to the local switch (that is, there is not a \\nvlan  global configuration command or the \\nswitch has not learned of the VLAN with VTP), and also minus those VLANs in shutdown mode\\nThird VLANs in \\nspanning tree…The second list, minus VLANs in an STP blocking state for that interface, and minus VLANs VTP pruned from that trunk\\nMismatched Native VLAN on a Trunk\\nClosing with a brief mention     of one other trunking topic, you should also check a trunk’s \\nnative VLAN configuration at this step. Unfortunately, it is possible to set the native VLAN ID to different VLANs on either end of the trunk, using the   \\nswitchport trunk native vlan  \\nvlan-id  command. If the native VLANs differ according to the two neighboring switches, \\nthe switches will accidentally cause frames to leave one VLAN and enter another.\\nFor example, if switch SW1 sends a frame using native VLAN 1 on an 802.1Q trunk, SW1 \\ndoes not add a VLAN header, as is normal for the native VLAN. When switch SW2 receives the frame, noticing that no 802.1Q header exists, SW2 assumes that the frame is part of \\nptg173963634Chapter 4: LAN Troubleshooting  119\\nSW2’s configured native VLAN. If SW2 has been configured to think VLAN 2 is the native \\nVLAN on that trunk, SW2 will try to forward the received frame into VLAN 2.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

As a result, the engineer configures the vlan  command on one \\nswitch, and all the rest of the switches are automatically configured with that same com-mand. \\nUnfortunately, the automated update powers of VTP can also be dangerous. For example, \\nan engineer   could delete a VLAN on one switch, not realizing that the command actually deleted the VLAN on all switches. And deleting a VLAN impacts a switch’s forwarding logic: Switches do not forward frames for VLANs that are not defined to the switch. \\nThis chapter discusses VTP, from concept through troubleshooting. The first major section \\ndiscusses VTP concepts, while the second section shows how to configure and verify VTP. The third section walks through troubleshooting, with some discussion of the risks that cause some engineers to just not use VTP. (In fact, the entirety of the ICND1 Cert Guide’s discussion of VLAN configuration assumes VTP uses the VTP transparent mode, which effectively disables VTP from learning and advertising VLAN configuration.)\\nAs for exam topics, note that the Cisco exam topics that mention VTP also mention DTP. \\nChapter 1, “Implementing Ethernet Virtual LANs,” discussed how Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) is used to negotiate VLAN trunking.

In particular, VTP advertises \\nabout the existence of each VLAN based on its VLAN ID and the VLAN name. \\nThis first major section of the chapter discusses the major features of VTP in concept, in \\npreparation for the VTP implementation (second section) and VTP troubleshooting (third section). \\nBasic VTP Operation\\nThink for a moment about what has to happen in a small network of four switches when you need to add two new hosts, and to put those hosts in a new VLAN that did not exist before. Figure 5-1 shows some of the main   configuration concepts.\\nFirst, remember that for a switch to be able to forward frames in a VLAN, that VLAN \\nmust be defined on that switch. In this case, Step 1 shows the independent configuration of VLAN 10 on the four switches: the two distribution switches and the two access layer switches. With the rules discussed in Chapter 1 (which assumed VTP transparent mode, by the way), all four switches need to be configured with the   \\nvlan 10  command.\\nStep 2 shows the additional step to configure each access port to be in VLAN 10 as per the design. That is, in addition to creating the VLAN, the individual ports need to be added to the VLAN, as shown for servers A and B with the \\nswitchport access vlan 10  command.\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  123\\nswitchport access vlan 10vlan 10 SW1 SW21\\nvlan 10 SW3 SW4\\n2\\nABvlan 10\\nvlan 101 11\\nFigure 5-1 Commands to Add Support for VLAN 10 in a Sample LAN\\nVTP, when used for its intended purpose, would allow the engineer to create the VLAN \\n(the vlan 10  command) on one switch only, with   VTP then automatically updating the con-\\nfiguration of the other switches.\\nVTP defines a Layer 2 messaging protocol that the switches can use to exchange VLAN \\nconfiguration information. When a switch changes its VLAN configuration—including the \\nvlan  vlan-id  command—VTP causes all the switches to synchronize their VLAN configura-\\ntion to include the same VLAN IDs and VLAN names. The process is somewhat like a rout-ing protocol, with each switch sending periodic VTP messages. However, routing protocols advertise information about the IP network, whereas VTP advertises VLAN configuration.\\nFigure 5-2 shows one example of how VTP works in the same scenario used for Figure 5-1. \\nFigure 5-2 starts with the need for a new VLAN 10, and two servers to be added to that VLAN. At Step 1, the network engineer creates the VLAN with the \\nvlan 10  command on \\nswitch SW1. SW1 then uses VTP to advertise that new VLAN configuration to the other switches, as shown at Step 2; note that the other three switches do not need to be config-ured with the \\nvlan 10  command. At Step 3, the network engineer still must configure the \\naccess ports with the switchport access vlan 10  command, because VTP does not adver-\\ntise the interface and access VLAN configuration.\\nVTP advertises the vlan  vlan-id  command, the name  vlan-name  subcommand, and several \\nVTP-specific commands. Of particular importance, note that VTP does not advertise the \\ncommand that associates an access port with a particular VLAN ( switchport access vlan  \\nvlan-id ), so those still need to be configured on the individual switches.\\nAlso, for historical reasons, VTP limits VTP servers and clients to use VLANs 1 through 1005. This range of VLAN IDs is known as     standard range VLANs, and includes VLAN 1, which is the default access VLAN and the default native VLAN on each port. The standard range ends with four reserved VLANs, 1002–1005, which are reserved for historical rea-sons. VTP servers can then configure any of the other standard range VLAN IDs (2–1001) and advertise those. \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B, C 2 C 3 A, D 4 A, B 5 B, C 6 A, B\\nptg17396363124  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSW1 SW2\\nVTP\\nSW3 SW42\\nABvlan 101\\n2\\n2\\nswitchport access vlan 103\\nFigure 5-2 Distributing the vlan 10 Command with VTP\\nNote that switches in VTP transparent mode, or a switch that has disabled VTP, can config-\\nure and use extended range VLANs, which in IOS switches extends the VLAN ID range up to 4094. \\nSynchronizing the VTP Database\\nTo use VTP to announce and/or learn VLAN configuration information, a switch must use either VTP \\nserver mode  or client mode . The third VTP mode, transparent mode , \\ntells a switch to not learn VLAN configuration and to not advertise VLAN configuration, effectively making a VTP transparent mode switch act as if it were not there, at least for the purposes of VTP. This next topic works through the mechanisms used by switches acting as either VTP server or client. \\nVTP servers     allow the network engineer to create VLANs (and other related commands) \\nfrom the CLI, whereas VTP clients do not allow the network engineer to create VLANs. You have seen many instances of the \\nvlan  vlan-id  command at this point in your study, \\nthe command that creates a new VLAN in a switch. VTP servers are allowed to continue to use this command to create VLANs, but switches placed in VTP client mode reject the \\nvlan  \\nvlan-id  command, because VTP client switches cannot create VLANs.\\nWith that main difference in mind, VTP servers allow the creation of VLANs (and related configuration) via the usual commands. The server then advertises that configuration infor-mation over VLAN trunks. The overall flow works something like this:\\n1. For each trunk, send VTP messages, and listen to receive them.\\n2. Check my local VTP parameters versus the VTP parameters announced in the VTP\\nmessages received on a trunk.\\n3. If the VTP parameters match, attempt to synchronize the VLAN configuration data-\\nbases between the two switches.\\nNOTE The name VLAN Trunking Protocol is based on the fact that this protocol works \\nspecifically over VLAN trunks, as noted in item 1 in this list.\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  125\\nDone correctly, VTP causes all the switches in the same administrative VTP domain —the \\nset of switches with the    same domain name and password—to converge to have the exact \\nsame configuration of VLAN information. Over time, each time the VLAN configuration is changed on any VTP server, all other switches in the VTP automatically learn of those con-figuration changes.\\nVTP does not think of the VLAN configuration as lots of small pieces of information, but \\nrather as one     \\nVLAN configuration database . The configuration database has a configura-\\ntion revision number which is incremented by 1 each time a server changes the VLAN con-figuration. The VTP synchronization process hinges on the idea of making sure each switch uses the VLAN configuration database that has the best (highest) revision number.\\nFigure 5-3 begins an example that demonstrates how the VLAN configuration database revi-\\nsion numbers work. At the beginning of the example, all the switches have converged to use the VLAN database that uses revision number 3. The example then shows:\\n1. The network engineer defines a new VLAN with the vlan 10  command on switch\\nSW1.\\n2. SW1, a VTP server, changes the VTP revision number for its own VLAN configura-\\ntion database from 3 to 4.\\n3. SW1 sends VTP messages over the VLAN trunk to SW2 to begin the process of tell-\\ning SW2 about the new VTP revision number for the VLAN configuration database.\\nRev. = 3SW1\\nRev. = 3SW2\\nRev. = 3SW3\\nRev. = 3SW4vlan 101\\nRev. + 1 = 42\\n3\\nVTP\\nFigure 5-3 Adding VLAN 10 at Switch SW1, Starting with All at Revision Number 3\\nAt this point, only switch SW1 has the best VLAN configuration database with the high-\\nest revision number (4). Figure 5-4 shows the next few steps, picking up the process where Figure 5-3 stopped. Upon receiving the VTP messages from SW1, as shown in Step 3 of Figure 5-3, at Step 4 in Figure 5-4, SW2 starts using that new LAN database. Step 5 empha-sizes the fact that as a result, SW2 now knows about VLAN 10. SW2 then sends VTP mes-sages over the trunk to the next switch, SW3 (Step 6).\\nWith VTP working correctly on all four switches, all the switches will eventually use the \\nexact same configuration, with VTP revision number 4, as advertised with VTP. \\nFigure 5-4 also shows a great example of one key similarity between VTP clients and serv-\\ners: both will learn and update their VLAN database from VTP messages received from another switch. Note that the process shown in Figures 5-3 and 5-4 works the same whether switches SW2, SW3, and SW4 are VTP clients or servers, in any combination. In this scenar-io, the only switch that must be a VTP server is switch SW1, where the \\nvlan 10  command \\nwas configured; a VTP client would have rejected the command. \\nptg17396363126  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRev. = 4SW1\\nRev. = 3 4SW2\\nRev. = 3SW3\\nRev. = 3SW46\\n4\\nNew VLAN 105VTP\\nFigure 5-4 Adding VLAN 10 at Switch SW1, Starting with All at Revision Number 3\\nFor instance, in Figure 5-5, imagine switches SW2 and SW4 were VTP clients, but switch \\nSW3 was a VTP server. With the same scenario discussed in Figures 5-3 and 5-4, the new VLAN configuration database is propagated just as described in those earlier figures, with SW2 (client), SW3 (server), and SW4 (client) all learning    of and using the new database with revision number 4.\\nRev. = 4\\nvlan 10\\n(Configured)SW1\\nRev. = 4\\nvlan 10\\n(Learned)SW2\\nRev. = 4\\nvlan 10\\n(Learned)SW3\\nRev. = 4\\nvlan 10\\n(Learned)Server\\n(Required)Client Server Client\\nSW4\\nFigure 5-5 Stable State, VTP Revision Number 4, All Switches Know VLAN 10\\nNOTE The complete process by which a server changes the VLAN configuration and all VTP switches learn the new configuration, resulting in all switches knowing the same VLAN IDs and name, is called \\nVTP synchronization .\\nAfter VTP synchronization is completed, VTP servers and clients also send periodic VTP messages every 5 minutes. If nothing changes, the messages keep listing the same VLAN database revision number, and no changes occur. Then when the configuration changes in one of the VTP servers, that switch increments its VTP revision number by 1, and its next VTP messages announce a new VTP revision number, so that the entire VTP domain (clients and servers) synchronize to use the new    VLAN database.\\nRequirements for VTP to Work Between Two Switches\\nWhen a VTP client or server connects to another VTP client or server switch, Cisco IOS requires that the following three facts    be true before the two switches will process VTP messages received from the neighboring switch: \\n■The link between the switches must be operating as a VLAN trunk (ISL or 802.1Q).\\n■The two switches’ case-sensitive VTP domain name must match.\\n■If configured on at least one of the switches, both switches must have configured the\\nsame case-sensitive VTP password.\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  127\\nThe VTP domain name provides a design tool by which engineers can create multiple \\ngroups of VTP switches, called    VTP domains , whose VLAN configurations are autono-\\nmous. To do so, the engineer can configure one set of switches in one VTP domain and another set in another VTP domain. Switches in one domain will ignore VTP messages from switches in the other domain, and vice versa. \\nThe VTP password mechanism provides a means by which a switch can prevent malicious \\nattackers from forcing a switch    to change its VLAN configuration. The password itself is never transmitted in clear text.\\nVTP Version 1 Versus Version 2\\nCisco supports three VTP versions, aptly    numbered versions 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the current ICND2/CCNA exam topics mention versions 1 and 2 specifically, but omit version 3. Version 3 adds more capabilities and features beyond versions 1 and 2, and as a result isa little more complex. Versions 1 and 2 are relatively similar, with version 2 updating ver-sion 1 to provide some specific feature updates. For example, version 2 added support for a type of LAN called Token Ring, but Token Ring is no longer even found in Cisco’s product line.\\nFor the purposes of configuring, verifying, and troubleshooting VTP today, versions 1 and \\n2 have no meaningful difference. For instance, two switches can be configured as VTP serv-ers, one using VTP version 1 and one using VTP version 2, and they do exchange VTP mes-sages and learn from each other. \\nThe one difference between VTP versions 1 and 2 that might matter has to do with the \\nbehavior of a VTP transparent mode switch. By design, VTP transparent mode is meant to allow a switch to be configured to not synchronize with other switches, but to also pass the VTP messages to VTP servers and clients. That is, the transparent mode switch is transparent to the intended purpose of VTP: servers and clients synchronizing. One of the requirements for transparent mode switches to forward the VTP messages sent    by servers and clients is that the VTP versions must match.\\nVTP Pruning\\nBy default, Cisco IOS on LAN switches allows frames in all configured VLANs to be passed over a trunk. Switches flood    broadcasts (and unknown destination unicasts) in each active VLAN out these trunks. \\nHowever, using VTP can cause too much flooded traffic to flow into parts of the network. \\nVTP advertises any new VLAN configured in a VTP server to the other server and client switches in the VTP domain. However, when it comes to frame forwarding, there may not be any need to flood frames to all switches, because some switches may not connect to devices in a particular VLAN. For example, in a campus LAN with 100 switches, all the devices in VLAN 50 may exist on only 3 to 4 switches. However, if VTP advertises VLAN 50 to all the switches, a broadcast in VLAN 50 could be flooded to all 100 switches.\\nOne solution to manage the flow of broadcasts is to manually configure the allowed VLAN \\nlists on the various VLAN trunks. However, doing so requires a manual configuration pro-cess. A better option might be to allow VTP to dynamically determine which switches do not have access ports in each VLAN, and prune (remove) those VLANs from the appropri-ate trunks to limit flooding. \\nVTP pruning  simply means that the appropriate switch trunk \\ninterfaces do not flood frames in that VLAN. \\nptg17396363128  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE The section “Mismatched Supported VLAN List on Trunks” in Chapter 4, “LAN \\nTroubleshooting,” discusses the various reasons why a switch trunk does not forward frames in a VLAN, including the allowed VLAN list. That section also briefly references VTP pruning.\\nFigure 5-6 shows an example of VTP pruning, showing a design that makes the VTP pruning feature more obvious. In this figure, two VLANs are used: 10 and 20. However, only switch SW1 has access ports in VLAN 10, and only switches SW2 and SW3 have access ports in VLAN 20. With this design, a frame in VLAN 20 does not need to be flooded to the left to switch SW1, and a frame in VLAN 10 does    not need to be flooded to the right to switches SW2 and SW3.\\nASW1\\nBRemove 20 \\nFrom G0/2 TrunkSW2\\nCSW3\\nVLAN 10G0/21\\n2No VLAN 20 Ports on theLeft—You Should Prune!VTP\\nVLAN 20\\nFigure 5-6 VTP Pruning Example\\nFigure 5-6 shows two steps that result in VTP pruning VLAN 10 from SW2’s G0/2 trunk:\\nStep 1. SW1 knows about VLAN 20 from VTP, but switch SW1 does not have access \\nports in VLAN 20. So SW1 announces to SW2 that SW1 would like to prune \\nVLAN 20, so that SW1 no longer receives data frames in VLAN 20.\\nStep 2. VTP on switch SW2 prunes VLAN 20 from its G0/2 trunk. As a result, SW2 \\nwill no longer flood VLAN 20 frames out trunk G0/2 to SW1.\\nVTP pruning increases the available bandwidth by restricting flooded traffic. VTP pruning \\nis one of the two most compelling reasons    to use VTP, with the other reason being to make VLAN configuration easier and more consistent.\\nSummary of VTP Features\\nTable 5-2 offers a comparative overview   of the three VTP modes.\\nTable 5-2 VTP Features\\nFunction Server Client Transparent \\nOnly sends VTP messages out ISL or 802.1Q trunks Y es Y es Y es\\nAllows CLI configuration of VLANs Y es No Y es\\nCan use normal range VLANs (1–1005) Y es Y es Y es\\nCan use extended range VLANs (1006–4095) No No Y es\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  129\\nFunction Server Client Transparent \\nSynchronizes its own config database when receiving VTP \\nmessages with a higher revision numberYe s Ye s No\\nCreates and sends periodic VTP updates every 5 minutes Y es Y es No\\nDoes not process received VTP updates, but does forward \\nreceived VTP updates out other trunksNo No Yes\\nVTP Configuration and Verification\\nVTP configuration requires only a few simple steps, but VTP has the power to cause signifi-\\ncant problems, either by accidental poor configuration choices or by malicious attacks. This second major section of the chapter focuses on configuring VTP correctly and verifying its operation. The third major section then looks at troubleshooting VTP, which includes being careful to avoid harmful scenarios.\\nUsing VTP: Configuring Servers and Clients\\nBefore configuring VTP, the     network engineer needs to make some choices. In particular, assuming that the engineer wants to make use of VTP’s features, the engineer needs to decide which switches will be in the same VTP domain, meaning that these switches will learn VLAN configuration information from each other. The VTP domain name must be chosen, along with an optional but recommended VTP password. (Both the domain name and password are case sensitive.) The engineer must also choose which switches will be serv-ers (usually at least two for redundancy) and which will be clients.\\nAfter the planning steps are completed, the following steps can be used to configure VTP:\\nStep 1. Use the vtp mode {server | client} command in global    configuration mode to \\nenable VTP on the switch as either a server or client. \\nStep 2. On both clients and servers, use the \\nvtp domain  domain-name  command in \\nglobal configuration mode to configure the case-sensitive VTP domain name.\\nStep 3. (Optional) On both clients and servers, use the vtp password  password-\\nvalue  command in global configuration mode to configure the case-sensitive \\npassword.\\nStep 4. (Optional) On servers, use the vtp pruning  global configuration command to \\nmake the domain-wide VTP pruning choice.\\nStep 5. (Optional) On both clients and servers, use the vtp version  {1 | 2} command in \\nglobal configuration mode to tell the local switch whether to use VTP version \\n1 or 2.\\nAs a network to use in the upcoming configuration examples, Figure 5-7 shows a LAN with \\nthe current VTP settings on each switch. At the beginning of the example in this section, both switches have all default VTP configuration: VTP server mode with a null domain name and password. With these default settings, even if the link between two switches is a trunk, VTP would    still not work.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg17396363130  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSW1 SW2G0/2 Trunk G0/1VLANs: 1, 2, 3, 1002–1005\\nVTP Mode: ServerVTP Domain: <null>VTP Password: <null>VTP Revision: 5\\nIP Address: 192.168.1.105VLANs: 1, 1002–1005VTP Mode: ServerVTP Domain: <null>VTP Password: <null>VTP Revision: 1\\nIP Address: 192.168.1.106\\nFigure 5-7 Beginning Settings for VTP Example\\nPer the figure, the switches do have some related configuration beyond the VTP configu-\\nration. SW1 has been configured to know about two additional VLANs (VLAN 2 and 3). Additionally, both switches have been configured with IP addresses—a fact that will be use-ful in upcoming \\nshow  command output.\\nTo move toward using VTP in these switches, and synchronizing their VLAN configuration databases, Figure 5-8 repeats Figure 5-7, but with some new configuration settings in bold text. Note that both switches now use the same VTP domain name and password. Switch SW1 remains at the default setting of being a VTP server, while switch SW2 is now config-ured to be a VTP client. Now, with matching VTP domain and password, and with a trunk between the two switches, the two switches will use    VTP successfully.\\nSW1 SW2G0/2 Trunk G0/1VLANs: 1, 2, 3, 1002–1005\\nVTP Mode: Server\\nVTP Revision: 5\\nIP Address: 192.168.1.105VLANs: 1, 1002–1005\\nVTP Mode: ClientVTP Domain: Freds-domainVTP Password: Freds-passwordVTP Revision: 1\\nIP Address: 192.168.1.106VTP Domain: Freds-domainVTP Password: Freds-password\\nFigure 5-8 New VTP Configuration Settings Planned for Example 5-1\\nExample 5-1 shows the configuration    shown in Figure 5-8 as added to each switch.\\nExample 5-1 Basic VTP Client and Server Configuration\\n!

The domain name and password, case-sensitive, match. Also, SW2, as client, does not need the \\nvtp pruning  command, because the VTP server dictates to the domain whether or \\nnot pruning is used throughout the domain. (Note that all VTP servers should be configured with the same VTP pruning setting.)\\nVerifying Switches Synchronized Databases\\nConfiguring VTP takes only a little work, as shown in Example 5-1. Most of the interest-ing activity with VTP happens in what it learns dynamically, and how VTP accomplishes that learning. For instance, Figure 5-7 showed the switch SW1 had revision number 5 for its VLAN configuration database, while SW2’s was revision 1. Once configured as shown in Example 5-1, the following logic happened through an exchange of VTP messages between SW1 and SW2:\\n1. SW1 and SW2        exchanged VTP messages.\\n2. SW2 realized that its own revision number (1) was lower (worse) than SW1’s revision\\nnumber 5.\\n3. SW2 received a copy of SW1’s VLAN database and updated SW2’s own VLAN (and\\nrelated) configuration.\\n4. SW2’s revision number also updated to revision number 5.\\nTo confirm that two neighboring switches synchronized their VLAN database, use the   \\nshow vtp status  command. Example 5-2 shows this command first on switch SW2, which \\nhad a lower revision number (1) at the start of the example, so it should have synchronized \\nits VLAN configuration database with switch SW1. The example shows the output of the \\nshow vtp status  command first on switch SW2, and then from switch SW1.\\nExample 5-2 Demonstrating the Switch SW2’s VLAN Database Updated to Revision 5\\n!

Both SW1 and SW2 list the exact same switch, with address\\n192.168.1.105. (Per Figure 5-8, 192.168.1.105 is switch SW1.) Also, note the text onSW1 lists “Local updater ID is 192.168.1.105…” which means that the local switch (SW1)\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  133\\nis 192.168.1.105. The fact that both switches list the same IP address and timestamp con-\\nfirm that they use the same database, in this case as supplied by 192.168.1.105, which is switch SW1. \\n■The “Configuration Revision” of 5 listed by both switches also confirms that they both\\nuse the same VLAN database.\\nNOTE Using NTP along with VTP can be useful so that the timestamps in the show vtp \\nstatus command on neighboring switches have the same time listed.\\nBeyond those two key facts, the show vtp status  command shows several key pieces \\nof information that must match on two neighboring switches before they can succeed at \\nexchanging their database. As highlighted only in switch SW1’s output in Example 5-2:\\n■Both use the same domain name (Freds-domain).\\n■Both have the same MD5 digest.\\nNote that while it is a good practice to set the switches to all use either version 1 or version 2, mismatched versions do not prevent VTP servers and clients from exchanging VTP con-figuration databases.\\nThe last item in the list, about the MD5 hash, needs a little further explanation. VTP on a \\nswitch takes the domain name and the VTP password and applies MD5 to create an MD5 digest, as displayed in the \\nshow vtp status  command’s output. If either the domain name \\nor password does not match, the MD5 digests will not match, and the two switches will not exchange VLAN configuration with VTP. (Note that the end of Example 5-2 lists a sample \\nshow vtp password  command, which lists the clear text VTP password.)\\nAny command that lists the VLANs known to a switch can also confirm that VTP worked. Once a VTP client or server learns a new VLAN configuration database from a neighbor, its list of VLANs should be identical to that of the neighbor. \\nFor instance, with the configuration suggested in Figure 5-8, as shown in Example 5-1, VTP \\nserver SW1 began with VLANs 1, 2, 3 and default VLANs 1002–1005, while switch SW2 only knew about the default VLANs: 1 and 1002–1005. Example 5-3 lists the output of \\nshow vlan brief  on switch SW2, confirming that it now also knows about VLANs 2 and 3. \\nNote that switch SW2 also learned the names        of the VLANs, not just the VLAN IDs.\\nExample 5-3 Switch SW2 Now Knows About VLANs 2 and 3\\nSW2# show vlan brief\\nVLAN Name                             Status    Ports\\n---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------\\n1    default active    Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4\\nFa0/5, Fa0/6, Fa0/7, Fa0/8\\nFa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11, Fa0/12\\nFa0/13, Fa0/14, Fa0/15, Fa0/16\\nFa0/17, Fa0/18, Fa0/19, Fa0/20Fa0/21, Fa0/22, Fa0/23, Fa0/24\\nGi0/1\\nptg17396363134  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n2    Freds-vlan active\\n3    VLAN0003 active\\n1002 fddi-default act/unsup\\n1003 token-ring-default act/unsup\\n1004 fddinet-default act/unsup\\n1005 trnet-default act/unsup\\nStoring the VTP and Related Configuration\\nInterestingly, even though VTP synchronizes VLAN and VTP configuration, you cannot \\njust issue a show running-config  command to discover if a switch has synchronized its \\nVLAN configuration database. VTP does not place the configuration commands into the running-config or startup-config file of the VTP server or client. Instead, VTP server and cli-ent mode switches store the \\nvtp configuration commands, and some VLAN configuration \\ncommands, in the vlan.dat file in flash. To verify these configuration commands     and their settings, use the \\nshow vtp status  and show vlan  commands. \\nFigure 5-9 shows an example. It shows three key   VTP commands ( vtp mode , vtp domain , \\nand vtp password ), plus a vlan 10  command that creates VLAN 10. It also shows the \\nswitchport access vlan 10  interface subcommand for contrast. Of these, on a VTP server \\nor client, only the switchport access vlan 10  command would be part of the running-\\nconfig or startup-config file.\\nRunning-config\\nAssign VLAN to Interface\\nswitchport access vlan xVLAN.dat\\nVLAN Commands\\nvlan x\\n        name vlan-name\\nVTP Commands\\nvtp domain domain-name\\nvtp mode servervtp password password\\nFigure 5-9 Where VTP Stores Configuration: VTP Client and Server\\nThere is no equivalent of a show running-config  command to display the contents of the \\nvlan.dat file. Instead, you have to use various show vtp  and show vlan  commands to view \\ninformation about VLANs and VTP. For reference, Table 5-3 lists the VLAN-related con-\\nfiguration commands, the location in which a VTP server or client     stores the commands, and how to view the settings for the commands.\\nTable 5-3 Where VTP Clients and Servers Store VLAN-Related Configuration\\nConfiguration Command Where Stored How to View\\nvtp domain   vlan.dat show vtp status   \\nvtp mode   vlan.dat show vtp status\\nvtp password   vlan.dat show vtp password   \\nvtp pruning   vlan.dat show vtp status\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  135\\nConfiguration Command Where Stored How to View\\nvlan  vlan-id   vlan.dat show vlan  [brief ]   \\nname  vlan-name   vlan.dat show vlan  [brief ]\\n[no] shutdown vlan  vlan-id   running-config show vlan  [brief ]\\nswitchport access vlan  vlan-id   running-config show running-config , show \\ninterfaces switchport     \\nswitchport voice vlan  vlan-id   running-config show running-config , show \\ninterfaces switchport\\nNote that switches using VTP transparent mode ( vtp mode transparent ), or with VTP dis-\\nabled ( vtp mode off ), store all the commands listed in Table 5-3 in the running-config and \\nstartup-config files.\\nAn interesting side effect of how VTP stores configuration is that when you use a VTP client \\nor server switch in a lab, and you want to remove all the configuration to start with a clean switch with all default VTP and VLAN configuration, you must issue more than the   \\nerase \\nstartup-config  command. If you only erase the startup-config and reload the switch, the \\nswitch remembers all VLAN config and VTP configuration that is instead stored in the vlan.dat file in flash. To remove those configuration details before reloading a switch, you would have to delete the vlan.dat file in flash with a command     such as \\ndelete flash:vlan.dat .\\nAvoiding Using VTP\\nFor most of the history of VTP, one option existed for avoiding using VTP: using VTP transparent mode. That is, each     switch technically had to use VTP in one of three modes (server, client, or transparent). \\nIn transparent mode, a switch never updates its VLAN database based on a received VTP \\nmessage, and never causes other switches to update their databases based on the transparent mode switch’s VLAN database. The only VTP action performed by the switch is to forward VTP messages received on one trunk out all the other trunks, which allows other VTP cli-ents and servers to work correctly. \\nConfiguring VTP transparent mode is simple: Just issue the   \\nvtp mode transparent  com-\\nmand in global configuration mode. Cisco eventually added an option to disable VTP altogether, with the   \\nvtp mode off  global \\ncommand. Note that one key difference exists versus using transparent mode: switches \\nusing vtp mode off  do not forward VTP messages. In short, if you want a switch to ignore \\nVTP, but forward VTP message from other switches, use transparent mode. If you want a switch to ignore VTP, including not forwarding any VTP messages, disable VTP. \\nVTP Troubleshooting\\nTroubleshooting VTP can be both simple and tricky at the same time. To troubleshoot issues in which VTP fails to cause synchronization to happen, you just have to work a short checklist, find the configuration or status issue, and solve    the problem. From the complete opposite direction, VTP can cause synchronization, but with bad results, using the wrong switch’s VLAN database. This last section looks at the straightforward case of troubleshoot-ing why VTP does not synchronize, as well as a few cases as to the dangers of VTP synchro-nizing with unfortunate results.\\nptg17396363136  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nDetermining Why VTP Is Not Synchronizing\\nVTP troubleshooting can be broken down     a pair of neighboring switches at a time. For any \\nVTP domain, with a number of switches, find any two neighboring switches. Then trouble-shoot to discover whether those two switches fail to meet the requirements to allow VTP to synchronize, and then fix the problem. Then work through every pair until VTP works throughout the VTP domain.\\nThe troubleshooting process must begin with some basics. You need to learn about the \\nLAN topology to then find and choose some neighboring switches to investigate. Then you need to determine whether the neighbors have synchronized or not, mainly by checking their list of VLANs, or by looking at information in the \\nshow vtp status  command. For \\nany pair of neighboring switches that have not synchronized, work through the list of con-figuration settings until the problem is fixed.\\nThe following list details a good process to find VTP configuration problems, organized \\ninto a list for easier study and reference. \\nStep 1. Confirm the switch names, topology (including which interfaces connect which \\nswitches), and switch VTP modes.\\nStep 2. Identify sets of two neighboring switches that should be either VTP clients or \\nservers whose VLAN databases differ with the \\nshow vlan  command.\\nStep 3. On each pair of two neighboring switches whose databases differ, verify the \\nfollowing:\\nA. Because VTP messages only flow over trunks, at least one operational \\ntrunk should exist between the two switches (use the show interfaces \\ntrunk, show interfaces switchport, or show cdp neighbors command).\\nB. The switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP domain name \\n(show vtp status).\\nC. If configured, the switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP \\npassword (show vtp password).\\nD. The MD5 digest should be the same, as evidence that both the domain \\nname and any configured passwords are the same on both switches (show vtp status).\\nE. While VTP pruning should be enabled or disabled on all servers in the \\nsame domain, having two servers configured with opposite pruning set-tings does not prevent the synchronization process.\\nStep 4. For each pair of switches identified in Step 3, solve the problem by either trou-\\nbleshooting the trunking problem or reconfiguring a switch to correctly match the domain name     or password.\\nVTP also has a few related commands that you might think would prevent synchronization, \\nbut they do not. Remember these facts about VTP for items that do not cause a problem for VTP synchronization:\\n■The VTP pruning setting does not have to match on neighboring switches (even though\\nin a real VTP network you would likely use the same setting on all switches).\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  137\\n■The VTP version does not have to match between two switches that are any combination\\nof VTP server and client for neighboring switches to synchronize.\\n■When deciding if VTP has synchronized, note that the administrative status of a VLAN\\n(per the shutdown vlan  vlan-id  global configuration command and the shutdown\\ncommand in VLAN configuration mode) is not communicated by VTP. So two neighbor-\\ning switches can know about the same VLAN, with that     VLAN shut down on one switchand active on the other.\\nCommon Rejections When Configuring VTP\\nVTP clients cannot configure VLANs at all, to either add them, delete them, or name them. \\nVTP servers (when using VTP versions 1 and 2) have the restriction of working with stan-dard number VLANs only. This next short topic looks      at the error messages shown when you attempt to add those VLANs in spite of what the chapter claims is allowed, just so you know what the error message looks like.\\nExample 5-4 shows some output on a switch (SW3) that is a VTP client. Focus first on the \\nrejection of the   \\nvlan 200  command. The result is clear and obvious: The user issued the \\nvlan 200  command, and IOS lists an error message about the switch being a VTP client.\\nExample 5-4 Attempting vlan Commands on VTP Clients and Servers\\nSW3# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

First, the vlan 200  command is \\nimmediately rejected. Second, the vlan 2000  command is also rejected, but not immediate-\\nly. IOS, in an odd twist of logic, does not actually try and add the configuration of extend-\\ned mode VLANs until the user exits VLAN configuration mode. Once the exit command \\nwas issued, IOS issued the three highlighted error messages—all messages that confirm in some way that the VLAN 2000 was not created.\\nNote that on a VTP server, the \\nvlan 200  command      would have been accepted but the vlan \\n2000  command would have been rejected, with the same process as shown in the example.\\nProblems When Adding Switches to a Network\\nVTP can be running just     fine for months, and then one day, the help desk receives a rash of \\ncalls describing cases in which large groups of users can no longer use the network. After further examination, it appears that most every VLAN in the campus has been deleted. The switches still have many interfaces with \\nswitchport access vlan  commands that refer to \\nthe now-deleted VLANs. None of the devices on those now-deleted VLANs work, because Cisco switches do not forward frames for nonexistent VLANs.\\nptg17396363138  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nVTP can cause the kind of pervasive LAN problems described in that previous paragraph, so \\nyou have to be careful when using VTP. This kind of problem can occur when a new switch is connected to an existing network. Whether this problem happens by accident or as a denial of service (DoS) attack, the root cause is this:\\nWhen two neighboring switches first connect with a trunk, and they also meet all the \\nrequirements to synchronize with VTP, the switch with the lower revision number accepts the VLAN database from the neighbor with the higher revision number.\\nNote in particular that the preceding statement says nothing about which switch is the \\nserver or client, or which switch is the older production switch versus the newly added switch. That is, no matter whether a server has the higher revision number or the client does, the two switches converge to both use the VLAN database with the higher revision number. There is no logic about which switch might be client or server, or which switch is the new switch in the network and which is the old established switch.\\nThis VTP behavior of using the higher revision number when connecting new switches has \\nsome pretty powerful implications. For instance, consider the following scenario: Someone is studying for the CCNA R&S exam, using the equipment in the small lab room at work. The lab has a couple of LAN switches isolated from the production network—that is, the switches have no links even cabled to the production network. But because the engineer knows the VTP domain name and password used in production, when configuring in the lab, the engineer uses that same VTP domain name and password. That     causes no problems (yet), because the lab switches do not even connect to the production network. (In real life, use a different VTP domain name and password in your lab gear!)\\nThis same engineer continues CCNA studying and testing in the lab, making lots of changes \\nto the VLAN configuration. Each change kicks the VLAN configuration database revision number up by 1. Eventually, the lab switches have a high VTP configuration revision num-ber, so high that the number is higher than that of the production switches. But the lab is still isolated, so there is still no problem. \\nDo you see the danger? All that has to happen now is for someone to connect a link from \\na lab switch to a production switch and make it trunk. For instance, imagine now that some other engineer decides to do some testing in the lab and does not think to check the VTP status on the lab switches versus the production switches. That second engineer walks into the lab and connects the lab switches to the production network. The link negotiates trunking…VTP synchronizes between a lab switch and a production switch…and those two switches discover that the lab switch’s configuration database has a higher revision number. At this point, VTP is now happily doing its job, synchronizing the VLAN configuration database, but unfortunately, VTP is distributing the lab’s VLAN configuration, deleting pro-duction VLANs.\\nIn real life, you have several ways to help reduce the chance of such problems when install-\\ning a new switch to an existing VTP domain. In particular, before connecting a new switch to an existing VTP domain, reset the new switch’s VTP revision number to 0 by either of the following methods:\\n■Configure the new switch for VTP transparent mode and then back to VTP client or\\nserver mode.\\n■Erase the new switch’s vlan.dat file in flash and reload the switch. (The vlan.dat file con-\\ntains the switch’s VLAN database, including     the revision number.)\\nptg173963635Chapter 5: VLAN Trunking Protocol  139\\nBesides the suggestion of resetting the VLAN database revision number before installing a \\nnew switch, a couple of other good VTP conventions, called best practices, can help avoid some of the pitfalls of VTP:\\n■If you do not intend to use VTP, configure each switch to use transparent mode ( vtp\\nmode transparent ) or off mode ( vtp mode off ).\\n■If using VTP server or client mode, always use a VTP password. That way a switch that\\nuses default settings (server mode, with no password set) will not accidentally overwrite\\nthe production VLAN database if connected to the production network with a trunk.\\n■In a lab, if using VTP, always use a different domain name and password than you use in\\nproduction.\\n■ Disable trunking with        the switchport mode access  and switchport nonegotiate  com-\\nmands on all interfaces except known trunks, preventing VTP attacks by preventing thedynamic establishment of trunks.\\nIt is possible that an attacker might attempt     a DoS attack using VTP. Preventing the negotia-\\ntion of trunking on most ports can greatly reduce the attacker’s opportunities to even try. Also, with a VTP password set on all switches, even if the attacker manages to get trunking working between the attacker’s switch and a production switch, the attacker would then have to know the password to do any harm. And of course, either using transparent mode or disabling VTP completely removes the risk.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

This chapter is the last of those chapters. This chapter completes the LAN-specific discussion with a few small topics that just do not fit neatly in the other chapters.\\nThe chapter begins with three security topics. The first section addresses IEEE 802.1x, \\nwhich defines a mechanism to secure user access to a LAN by requiring the user to supply a username and password before a switch allows the device’s sent frames into the LAN. This tool helps secure the network against attackers gaining access to the network. The second section, “AAA Authentication,” discusses network device security, protecting router and switch CLI access by requiring username/password login with an external authentication server. The third section, “DHCP Snooping,” explores how switches can prevent security attacks that take advantage of DHCP messages and functions. By watching DHCP messages, noticing when they are used in abnormal ways not normally done with DHCP, DHCP can prevent attacks by simply filtering certain DHCP messages.\\nThe final of the four major sections in this chapter looks at two similar design tools that \\nmake multiple switches act like one switch: switch stacking and chassis aggregation. Switch stacking allows a set of similar switches that sit near to each other (in the same wiring closet, typically in the same part of the same rack) to be cabled together and then act like a single switch. Using a switch stack greatly reduces the amount of work to manage the switch, and it reduces the overhead of control and management protocols used in the network. Switch chassis aggregation has many of the same benefits, but is supported more often as a dis-tribution or core switch feature, with switch stacking as a more typical access layer switch feature.\\nAll four sections of this chapter have a matching exam topic that uses the verb “describe,” \\nso this chapter touches on the basic descriptions of a tool, rather than deep configuration. A few of the topics will show some configuration as a means to describe the topic, but the chapter is meant to help you come away with an understanding of the fundamentals, rather than an ability to configure the features.\\nptg17396363“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help \\nyou decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

When you move to a new space, all you have to do is connect a short patch cable from your PC to the RJ-45 socket on the wall and you are     connected to the network. Once booted, your PC can send packets anywhere in the network. Security? That happens mostly at the devices you try to access, for instance, when you log in to a server.\\nThat previous paragraph is true of how many networks work. That attitude views the net-\\nwork as an open highway between the endpoints in the network, and the network is there to create connectivity, with high availability, and to make it easy to connect your device. Those goals are worthy goals. However, making the LAN accessible to anyone, so that any-one can attempt to connect to servers in the network, allows attackers to connect and then try and break in to the security that protects the server. That approach may be too insecure. For instance, any attacker who could gain physical access could plug in his laptop and start running tools to try to exploit all those servers attached to the internal network.\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  145\\nToday, many companies secure access to the network. Sure, they begin by creating basic \\nconnectivity: cabling the LAN and connecting cables to all the desks at all the cubicles and offices. All those ports physically work. But a user cannot just plug in her PC and start working; she must go through a security process before the LAN switch will allow the user to send any other messages in the network.\\nSwitches can use IEEE standard 802.1x to secure access to LAN ports. To set up the fea-\\nture, the LAN switches must be configured to enable 802.1x. Additionally, the IT staff must implement an authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server. The AAA server (commonly pronounced “triple A” server) will keep the usernames and passwords, and when the user supplies that information, it is the AAA server that       determines if what the user typed was correct or not. \\nOnce implemented, the LAN switch acts as an 802.1x authenticator, as   shown in Figure 6-1. \\nAs an 802.1x authenticator, a switch can be configured to enable some ports for 802.1x, most likely the access ports connected to end users. Enabling a port for 802.1x defines that when the port first comes up, the switch filters all incoming traffic      (other than 802.1x traf-fic). 802.1x must first authenticate the user that uses that device.\\nSW1\\nUnplugged Allow Only\\n802.1xAuthenticator\\nFigure 6-1 Switch as 802.1x Authenticator, with AAA Server, and PC Not Yet Connected\\nNote that the switch usually configures access ports that connect to end users with 802.1x, but does not enable 802.1x on ports connected to IT-controlled devices, such as trunk ports, or ports connected in parts of the network that are physically more secure. \\nThe 802.1x authentication process works like the flow in Figure 6-2. Once the PC connects \\nand the port comes up, the switch uses 802.1x messages to ask the PC to supply a user-name/password. The PC user must then supply that information. For        that process to work, the end-user device must be using an 802.1x client called a supplicant; many OSs include an 802.1x supplicant, so it may just be seen as a part of the OS settings.\\nAt Steps 3 and 4 in Figure 6-2, the switch authenticates the user, to find out if the username \\nand password combination is legitimate. The switch, acting as 802.1x authenticator, asks the AAA server if the supplied username and password combo is correct, with the AAA server answering back. If the username and password       were correct, then the switch authorizes the port. Once authorized, the switch no longer filters incoming messages on that port. If the username/password check shows that the username/password was incorrect, or the process fails for any reason, the port remains in an unauthorized state. The user can continue to retry the attempt.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 D 2 C 3 A, C 4 B, C 5 C \\nptg17396363146  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSW1\\nUser/PasswordAuthentication\\nServer Authenticator Supplicant\\n3\\nAuthorized!4Identify Yourself1\\nUser/Password2\\nFigure 6-2 Generic 802.1x Authentication Flows\\nFigure 6-3 rounds out this topic by showing an example of one key protocol used by \\n802.1x: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). The switch (the authenticator) uses RADIUS between itself and the AAA server, which itself uses IP and UDP. However, 802.1x, an Ethernet protocol, does not use IP or UDP. But 802.1x wants to exchange some authentication information all the way to the RADIUS AAA server. The solution is to            use EAP, as shown in Figure 6-3.\\nSW1\\nIP EAP RADIUS\\nRADIUS with EAPAuthentication\\nServer Authenticator Supplicant\\nUDP Eth. EAP\\nEAPoL\\nFigure 6-3 EAP and Radius Protocol Flows with 802.1x\\nAs shown in the figure, the EAP message flows from the supplicant to the authentica-tion server, just in different types of messages. The flow from the supplicant (the end-user device) to the switch transports the EAP message directly in an Ethernet frame with an encapsulation    called EAP over LAN (EAPoL). The flow from the authenticator (switch) to \\nthe authentication server flows in an IP packet. In fact, it looks much like a normal message used by the RADIUS protocol (RFC 2865). The RADIUS protocol   works as a UDP applica-tion, with an IP and UDP header, as shown in the figure. \\nNow that you have heard some of the details and terminology, this list summarizes the \\nentire process:\\n■A AAA server must be configured with usernames and passwords.\\n■Each LAN switch must be enabled for 802.1x, to enable the switch as an authenticator,\\nto configure the IP address of the AAA server, and to enable 802.1x on the required\\nports.\\n■Users must know a username/password     combination that exists on the AAA server, or\\nthey will not be able to access the network from any device.\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  147\\nAAA Authentication\\nThe ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide discusses many details about device management, in par-\\nticular how to secure network devices. However, all those device security methods shown in the ICND1 half of the CCNA R&S exam topics use locally configured    information to secure the login to the networking device. \\nUsing locally configured usernames and passwords configured on the switch causes some \\nadministrative headaches. For instance, every switch and router needs the configuration for all users who might need to log in to the devices. Good security practices tell us to change our passwords regularly, but logging in to hundreds of devices to change passwords is a large task, so often, the passwords remain unchanged for long periods. \\nA better option would be to use an external AAA server. The AAA server centralizes and \\nsecures all the username/password pairs. The switches and routers still need some local security configuration to refer to the AAA server, but the username/password exist cen-trally, greatly reducing the administrative effort, and increasing the chance that passwords are changed regularly and are more secure. It is also easier to track which users logged in to which devices and when, and to revoke access as people leave their current job.\\nThis short section discusses the basics of how networking devices can use a AAA server.\\nAAA Login Process\\nFirst, to use AAA, the site would        need to install and configure a AAA server, such as the \\nCisco Access Control Server (ACS). Cisco ACS is AAA software that you can install on your own server (physical or virtual).\\nThe networking devices would each then need new configuration to tell the device to start \\nusing the AAA server. That configuration would point to the IP address of the AAA server, and define which AAA protocol to use: either TACACS+ or RADIUS. The configuration includes details about TCP (TACACS+) or UDP (RADIUS) ports to use.\\nWhen using a AAA server for authentication, the switch (or router) simply sends a message \\nto the AAA server asking whether the username and password are allowed, and the AAA server replies. Figure 6-4 shows an example, with the user first supplying his username/pass-word, the switch asking the AAA server, and the server replying to the switch stating that the username/password is valid.\\nA\\nS1Login: wendell/odom1 Login: wendell/odom2\\nCommand Prompt4 Approved! AAA 3SW1\\nRADIUS or TACACS+ Telnet or SSH\\nFigure 6-4 Basic Authentication Process with an External AAA Server\\nTACACS+ and RADIUS Protocols\\nWhile Figure 6-4 shows the general idea, note that the information flows with a couple of different protocols. On the left, the connection between the user and the switch or \\nptg17396363148  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nrouter uses Telnet or SSH. On the right, the switch and AAA server typically use either the \\nRADIUS or TACACS+ protocol, both of which encrypt the        passwords as they traverse the network.\\nThe AAA server can also provide authorization and accounting features as well. For \\ninstance, for networking devices, IOS can be configured so that each user can be allowed to use only a specific subset of CLI commands. So, instead of having basically two levels of authority—user mode and privileged mode—each device can configure a custom set of command authority settings per user. Alternately, those details can be centrally configured at the AAA server, rather than configuring the details at each device. As a result, different users can be allowed to use different subsets of the commands, but as identified through requests to the AAA server, rather than repetitive laborious configuration on every device. (Note that TACACS+ supports this particular command authorization function, whereas RADIUS does not.)\\nTable 6-2 lists some basic comparison points        between TACACS+ and RADIUS.\\nTable 6-2 Comparisons Betwe en TACAC S+ and RADIUS\\nFeatures TACACS+ R ADIUS\\nMost often used for Network devices Users\\nTransport protocol TCP UDP\\nAuthentication port number(s) 49 1645, 1812\\nProtocol encrypts the password Y es Y es\\nProtocol encrypts entire packet Y es No\\nSupports function to authorize each user to a subset of CLI \\ncommandsYe s No\\nDefined by Cisco RFC 2865\\nAAA Configuration Examples\\nLearning how to configure     a router or switch to use a AAA server can be difficult. AAA \\nrequires that you learn several new commands. Besides all that, enabling AAA actually changes the rules used on a router for login authentication—for instance, you cannot just add a login command on the console line anymore after you have enabled AAA. \\nThe exam topics use the phrase “describe” regarding AAA features, rather than configure, \\nverify, or troubleshoot. However, to understand AAA on switches or routers, it helps to work through an example configuration. This next topic focuses on the big ideas behind a AAA configuration, instead of worrying about working through all the parameters, verifying the results, or memorizing a checklist of commands. The goal is to help you see how AAA on a switch or router changes login security.\\nNOTE Throughout this book and the ICND1 Cert Guide, the login security details work the same on both routers and switches, with the exception that switches do not have an aux-iliary port, whereas routers often do. But the configuration works the same on both routers and switches, so when this section mentions a switch for login security, the same concept applies to routers as well.\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  149\\nEverything you learned about switch login security for ICND1 in the ICND1 Cert Guide \\nassumed an unstated default global command: no aaa new-model. That is, you had not yet added the aaa new-model global command to the configuration. Configuring AAA requires   the aaa new-model command, and this single global command changes how that switch \\ndoes login security.\\nThe aaa new-model global command enables AAA services in the local switch (or router). \\nIt even enables new commands, commands     that would not have been accepted before, and \\nthat would not have shown up when getting help with a question mark from the CLI. The aaa new-model command also changes some default login authentication settings. So, think of this command as the dividing line between using the original simple ways of login secu-rity versus a more advanced method.\\nAfter configuring the aaa new-model command on a switch, you need to define each AAA \\nserver, plus configure one or more groups of AAA servers    aptly named a AAA group. For each AAA server, configure its IP address and a key, and optionally the TCP or UDP port number used, as seen in the middle part of Figure 6-5. Then you create a server group for each group of AAA servers to group one or more AAA servers, as seen in the bottom     of Figure 6-5. (Other configuration settings will then refer to the AAA server group rather than the AAA server.)\\nEnable AAA Model of Authentication\\naaa new-model\\nConfigure for Each AAA Server\\ntacacs server <server-name>\\naddress ipv4 <address>\\n key <key value>\\n     port <port number> \\nCreate a Group of One or More Servers\\naaa group server <group-name>\\nserver name <server-name-1>\\nserver name <server-name-2>\\nFigure 6-5 Enabling AAA and Defining AAA Servers and Groups\\nThe configuration concepts in Figure 6-5 still have not completed the task of configuring AAA authentication. IOS uses the following additional logic to connect the rest of the logic:\\n■IOS does login authentication for the console, vty, and aux port, by default, based on\\nthe setting of the   aaa authentication login default global command.\\n■The aaa authentication login default method1 method2… global command lists differ-\\nent authentication methods, including referencing a AAA group to be used (as shown at\\nthe bottom of Figure 6-5).\\n■The methods include: a defined AAA group of AAA servers; local, meaning a locally\\nconfigured list of usernames/passwords; or line, meaning to use the password defined bythe password line subcommand.\\nBasically, when you want to use AAA for login authentication on the console or vty lines, \\nthe most straightforward option uses the aaa authentication login default command. As \\nptg17396363150  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 6-6 shows with this command, it lists multiple authentication methods. The switch \\ntries the first method, and if that method returns a definitive answer, the process is done. However, if that method is not available (for instance, none of the AAA servers is reachable           over the IP network), IOS on the local device moves on to the next method.\\naaa authentication login default   <method 1>   <method 2>\\nTries This First\\nTries This Second\\nFigure 6-6 Default Login Authentication Rules\\nThe idea of defining at least a couple of methods for login authentication makes good sense. For instance, the first method could be a AAA group so that each engineer logs in to each device with that engineer’s unique username and password. However, you would not want the engineer to fail to log in just because the IP network is having problems and the AAA servers cannot send packets back to the switch. So, using a backup login method (a second method listed in the command) makes good sense.\\nFigure 6-7 shows three sample commands for perspective. All three commands reference \\nthe same AAA group (WO-AAA-Group). The command labeled with a 1 in the figure takes a shortsighted approach, using only one authentication method with the AAA group. Command 2 in the figure uses two authentication methods: one with AAA and a second method (local). (This command’s local keyword refers to the list of local username com-mands as configured on the local switch.) Command 3 in the figure again uses a AAA group as the first method, followed       by the keyword login, which tells IOS to use the password line subcommand.\\naaa authentication login default  group WO-AAA-Group\\n(Uses AAA Server)\\naaa authentication login default  group WO-AAA-Group   local\\n2nd: Uses Local Usernames\\n2nd: Use Login Password(Uses AAA Server)\\naaa authentication login default  group WO-AAA-Group   login\\n(Uses AAA Server)321\\nFigure 6-7 Examples of AAA Login Authentication Method Combinations\\nDHCP Snooping\\nTo understand the kinds of risks that exist in modern networks, you have to first understand \\nthe rules. Then you have to think about how an attacker might take advantage of those rules in different ways. Some attacks might cause harm, and might be called   a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Or an attacker may gather more data to prepare for some other attack. Whatever the goal, for every protocol and function you learn in networking, there are pos-sible methods to take advantage of those features to give an attacker an advantage. \\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  151\\nCisco chose to add one exam topic for this current CCNA R&S exam that focuses on \\nmitigating attacks based on a specific protocol: DHCP. DHCP has become a very popular protocol, used in most every enterprise, home, and service provider. As a result, attackers have looked for methods to take advantage of DHCP. One way to help mitigate the risks of DHCP is to use a LAN switch feature called DHCP snooping.\\nThis third of four major sections of the chapter works through the basics of DHCP snoop-\\ning. It starts with the main idea, and then shows one example of how an attacker can misuse DHCP to gain an advantage. The last section explains the logic used by DHCP snooping.\\nDHCP Snooping Basics\\nDHCP snooping    on a switch acts like a firewall or an ACL in many ways. It will watch for incoming messages on either all ports or some ports (depending on the configuration). It will look for DHCP messages, ignoring all non-DHCP messages and allowing those through. For any DHCP messages, the switch’s DHCP snooping logic will make a choice: allow the message or discard the message.\\nTo be clear, DHCP snooping is a Layer 2 switch feature, not a router feature. Specifically, \\nany switch that performs Layer 2 switching, whether it does only Layer 2 switching or acts as a multilayer switch, typically supports DHCP snooping. DHCP snooping must be done on a device that sits between devices in the same VLAN, which is the role of a Layer 2 switch rather than a Layer 3 switch or router.  \\nThe first big idea with DHCP snooping is the idea of trusted ports and untrusted ports. \\nTo understand why, ponder for a moment all the devices       that might be connected to one switch. The list includes routers, servers, and even other switches. It includes end-user devic-es, such as PCs. It includes wireless access points, which in turn connect to end-user devices. Figure 6-8 shows a representation.\\nSW1\\nDHCP\\nServerTrusted Untrusted\\nSW1 R1\\nFigure 6-8 DHCP Snooping Basics: Client Ports Are Untrusted\\nDHCP snooping begins with the assumption that end-user devices are untrusted, while devices more within the control of the IT department are trusted. However, a device on an untrusted port can still use DHCP. Instead, making a port untrusted for DHCP       snooping means this:\\nWatch for incoming DHCP messages, and discard any that are considered to be abnormal \\nfor an untrusted port and therefore likely to be part of some kind of attack.\\nptg17396363152  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAn Example DHCP-based Attack\\nTo give you perspective, Figure 6-9 shows a legitimate user’s PC on the far right and the \\nlegitimate DHCP sever on the far left. However, an attacker has connected his laptop to the LAN and started his DHCP attack. Remember, PC1’s first       DHCP message will be a LAN broadcast, so the attacker’s PC will receive those LAN broadcasts from any DHCP clients like PC1.

Why? The attacker wants PC1 to function, but with one twist. Notice the default gateway assigned to PC1: 10.1.1.2, which is the attacker’s PC address, rather than 10.1.1.1, which is R1’s address. Now PC1 thinks it has all it needs to connect to the network, and it does—but now all the packets sent by PC1 flow first through the attacker’s PC, creating a man-in-the-middle attack, as shown in Figure 6-10.\\nAttacker: Man-in-the-Middle10.1.1.1 SW1 R2 R1\\n10.1.1.11\\nGW=10.1.1.21 2\\n10.1.1.2\\nFigure 6-10 Unfortunate Result: DHCP Attack Leads to Man-in-the-Middle\\nThe two steps in the figure show data flow once DHCP has completed. For any traffic destined to leave the subnet, PC1 sends its packets to its default gateway, 10.1.1.2, which happens to be the attacker. The attacker forwards the packets to R1. The PC1 user can con-nect to any and all applications just like normal, but now the attacker can keep a copy       of anything sent by PC1.\\nHow DHCP Snooping Works\\nThe preceding example shows just one attack. Some attacks use an extra DHCP server (called a spurious DHCP server), and some attacks happen by using DHCP client functions \\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  153\\nin different ways. DHCP snooping considers how DHCP should work and filters out any \\nmessages that would not be part of a normal use of DHCP.\\nDHCP snooping     needs a few configuration settings. First, the engineer enables DHCP \\nsnooping either globally on a switch or by VLAN (that is, enabled on some VLANs, and not on others). Once enabled, all ports are considered untrusted until configured as trusted.\\nNext, some switch ports need to be configured as trusted. Any switch ports connected to \\nlegitimate DHCP servers       should be trusted. Additionally, ports connected to other switches, and ports connected to routers, should also be trusted. Why? Trusted ports are basically ports that could receive messages from legitimate DHCP servers in the network. The legiti-mate DHCP servers in a network are well known.\\nJust for a quick review, the ICND1 Cert Guide described the DHCP messages used in nor-\\nmal DHCP lease flows (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACK [DORA]). For these and other DHCP messages, a message is normally sent by either a DHCP client or a server, but not both. In the DORA messages, the client sends the DISCOVER and REQUEST, and the server sends the OFFER and ACK. Knowing that only DHCP servers should send DHCP OFFER and ACK messages, DHCP snooping allows incoming OFFER and ACK messages on trusted ports, but filters those messages if they arrive on untrusted ports. \\nSo, the first rule of DHCP snooping is for the switch to trust any ports on which legitimate \\nmessages from trusted DHCP servers might arrive. Conversely, by leaving a port untrusted, the switch is choosing to discard any incoming DHCP server-only messages. Figure 6-11 summarizes these points, with    the legitimate DHCP server on the left, on a port marked as trusted.\\nF0/1\\nDHCP All Messages: Approved! DHCP Server  Messages: Rejected!\\nDHCP Client Messages: Check Binding TableF0/2\\nSW1DHCP DHCPTrusted Untrusted\\nFigure 6-11 Summary of Rules for DHCP Snooping\\nThe logic for untrusted DHCP ports is a little more challenging. Basically, the untrusted ports are the real user population, all      of which rely heavily on DHCP. Those ports also include those few people trying to attack the network with DHCP, and you cannot predict which of the untrusted ports have legitimate users and which are attacking the network. So the DHCP snooping function has to watch the DHCP messages over time, and even keep some state information in a DHCP Binding Table, so that it can decide when a DHCP mes-sage should be discarded.\\nThe DHCP Binding Table is     a list of key pieces of information about each successful lease \\nof an IPv4 address. Each new DHCP message received on an untrusted port can then be compared to the DHCP Binding Table, and if the switch detects conflicts when comparing the DHCP message to the Binding Table, then the switch will discard the message. \\nTo understand more specifically, first look at Figure 6-12, which shows a switch building \\none entry in its DHCP Binding Table. In this simple network, the DHCP client on the right \\nptg17396363154  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nleases IP address 10.1.1.11 from the DHCP server on the left. The switch’s DHCP snoop-\\ning feature combines the information from the DHCP messages, with information about the port (interface F0/2, assigned to VLAN 11 by the switch), and puts that in the DHCP Binding Table.\\nMAC: 0200.1111.1111\\nIP: 10.1.1.11\\nSW1 DHCP Binding Table\\nInterface VLAN MAC IP\\nF0/2 11 0200.1111.1111 10.1.1.11DHCPF0/1 F0/2\\nSW1Trusted Untrusted\\nFigure 6-12 Legitimate DHCP Client with DHCP Binding Entry Built by DHCP \\nSnooping\\nBecause of this DHCP binding table entry, DHCP snooping would now prevent another \\nclient on another switch port from claiming to be using that same IP address (10.1.1.11) or the same MAC address (2000.1111.1111). (Many DHCP client attacks will use the same IP address or MAC address as a legitimate host.)  \\nNote that beyond firewall-like rules of filtering based on logic, DHCP snooping can also \\nbe configured to rate limit the      number of DHCP messages on an interface. For instance, by rate limiting incoming DHCP messages on untrusted interfaces, DHCP snooping can help prevent a DoS attack designed to overload the legitimate DHCP server, or to consume all the available DHCP IP address space.\\nSummarizing DHCP Snooping Features\\nDHCP snooping can help reduce risk, particularly because DHCP is such a vital part of most networks. The following list summarizes some of the key points about DHCP snooping for easier exam study:\\nTrusted ports: Trusted ports      allow all incoming DHCP messages.\\nUntrusted ports, server messages: Untrusted ports      discard all incoming messages that are \\nconsidered server messages.\\nUntrusted ports, client messages: Untrusted ports apply more complex logic for mes-\\nsages considered client messages. They check whether each incoming DHCP message conflicts with existing DHCP binding table information and, if so, discard the DHCP mes-sage. If the message has no conflicts, the switch allows the message through, which typi-cally results in the addition of new DHCP Binding Table entries.\\nRate limiting: Optionally limits the     number of received DHCP messages per second, per \\nport.\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  155\\nSwitch Stacking and Chassis Aggregation\\nCisco offers several options that allow customers to configure their Cisco switches to act \\ncooperatively to appear as one switch, rather than as multiple switches. This final major section of the chapter discusses two major branches of these technologies: switch stacking, which is more typical of access layer switches, and chassis aggregation, more commonly found on distribution and core switches.\\nTraditional Access Switching Without Stacking\\nImagine for a moment that you are in charge of ordering all the gear for a new campus, with several multistory office buildings. You take a tour of the space, look at drawings of the space, and start thinking about where all the people and computers will be. At some point, you get to the point of thinking about how many Ethernet ports you need in each wiring closet.\\nImagine for one wiring closet you need 150 ports today, and you want to build enough \\nswitch port capacity to 200 ports. What size   switches do you buy? Do you get one switch for the wiring closet, with at least 200 ports in the switch? (The books do not discuss vari-ous switch models very much, but yes, you can buy LAN switches with hundreds of ports in one switch.) Or do you buy a pair of switches with at least 100 ports each? Or eight or nine switches with 24 access ports each?\\nThere are pros   and cons for using smaller numbers of large switches, and vice versa. To \\nmeet those needs, vendors such as Cisco offer switches with a wide range of port densities. However, a switch feature called switch stacking gives you some of the benefits of both worlds. \\nTo appreciate the benefits of switch stacking, imagine a typical LAN design like the one \\nshown in Figure 6-13. The figure shows the conceptual design, with two distribution switch-es and four access layer switches. \\nA1 A2 A3 A4D1 D2\\nFigure 6-13 Typical Campus Design: Access Switches and Two Distribution Switches\\nFor later comparison, let me emphasize a few   points here. Access switches A1 through A4 all operate as separate devices. The network engineer must configure each. They each have an IP address for management. They each run CDP, STP, and maybe VTP. They each have a MAC address table, and they each forward Ethernet frames based on that MAC address table. Each switch probably has very similar configuration, but that configuration is sepa-rate, and all the functions are separate.\\nptg17396363156  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNow picture those same four access layer switches physically, not in Figure 6-13, but as you \\nwould imagine them in a wiring closet, even in the same rack. In this case, imagine all four access switches sit in the same rack in the same closet. All the wiring on that floor of the building runs back to the wiring closet, and each cable is patched into some port in one of these four switches. Each switch might be one rack unit (RU) tall (1.75 inches), and they all sit one on top of the other. \\nSwitch Stacking of Access Layer Switches\\nThe scenario described so far is literally a stack of switches one above the other. Switch stacking technology allows the network engineer to make that stack of physical switches act like one switch. For instance, if a switch     stack was made from the four switches in Figure 6-13, the following would apply:\\n■The stack would have a single management IP address.\\n■The engineer would connect with Telnet or SSH to one switch (with that one manage-\\nment IP address), not multiple switches.\\n■One configuration file would include all interfaces in all four physical switches.\\n■STP, CDP, VTP would run on one switch, not multiple switches.\\n■The switch ports would appear as if all are on the same switch.\\n■There would be one MAC address table, and it would reference all ports on all physical\\nswitches.\\nThe list could keep going much longer for all possible switch features, but the point is that switch stacking makes the switches act as if they are simply parts of a single larger switch.\\nTo make that happen, the switches must be connected together with a special network. The \\nnetwork does not use standard Ethernet ports. Instead, the switches have special hardware ports called   stacking ports. With the Cisco FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus stacking technol-\\nogy, a stacking module must be inserted into each switch, and then connected with a stack-ing cable. \\nNOTE Cisco has created a few switch stacking technologies over the years, so to avoid having to refer to them all, note that this section describes Cisco’s FlexStack and FlexStack Plus options. These stacking technologies are supported to different degrees in the popular 2960-S, 2960-X, and 2960-XR switch families. \\nThe stacking cables together make a ring between the switches as shown in Figure 6-14. That is, the switches connect in series, with the last switch connecting again to the first. Using full duplex on each link, the stacking modules and  cables create two paths to forward data between the physical switches in the stack. The switches use these connections to com-municate between the switches to forward frames and to perform other       overhead functions.\\nNote that each stacking module has two ports with which to connect to another switch’s \\nstacking module. For instance, if the four switches were all 2960XR switches, each would need one stacking module, and four cables total to connect the four switches as shown. Figure 6-15 shows the same idea in Figure 6-14, but as a photo that shows the stacking cables on the left side of the figure.\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  157\\nStacking CablesA1 A2 A3 A4D1 D2\\nFigure 6-14 Stacking Cables Between Access Switches in the Same Rack\\nFigure 6-15 Photo of Four 2960X Switches Cabled on the Left with Stacking Cables\\nYou should think of switch stacks as literally a stack of switches in the same rack. The \\nstacking cables are short, with the expectation that the switches sit together in the same room and rack. For instance, Cisco offers stacking cables of .5, 1, and 3 meters long for the FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus stacking technology discussed in more     depth at the end of this section.\\nSwitch Stack Operation as a Single Logical Switch\\nWith a switch stack, the switches     together act as one logical switch. This term (logical \\nswitch) is meant to emphasize that there are obviously physical switches, but they act together as one switch.\\nTo make it all work, one switch acts as a    stack master to control the rest of the switches. \\nThe links created by the stacking cables allow the physical switches to communicate, but the stack master is in control of the work. For instance, if you number the physical switches as 1, 2, 3, and 4, a frame might arrive on switch 4 and need to exit a link on switch 3. If switch 1 were the stack master, switches 1, 3, and 4 would all need to communicate over the stack links to forward that frame. But switch 1, as stack master, would do the matching of the MAC address table to choose where to forward the frame. \\nFigure 6-16 focuses on the LAN design impact of how a switch stack acts like one logical \\nswitch. The figure shows the design with no changes to the cabling between the four access switches and the distribution switches. Formerly, each separate access switch had two links \\nptg17396363158  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nto the distribution layer: one connected to each distribution switch (see Figure 6-13). That \\ncabling is unchanged. However, acting as one logical switch, the switch stack now operates as if it is one switch, with four uplinks to each distribution switch. Add a little configuration to put each set of four links into an EtherChannel, and you have the design shown in Figure 6-16. \\nD1 D2\\nSingle Switch\\nFigure 6-16 Stack Acts Like One Switch\\nThe stack also simplifies operations. Imagine for instance the scope of an STP topology for a VLAN that has access ports in all four of the physical access switches in this example. That Spanning Tree would include all six switches. With the switch stack acting as one logi-cal switch, that same VLAN now has only three switches in the STP topology, and     is much easier to understand and predict. \\nCisco FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus\\nJust to put a finishing touch on the idea of a switch stack, this closing topic examines a few particulars of Cisco’s FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus stacking options.\\nCisco’s stacking technologies require that Cisco plan to include stacking as a feature in a \\nproduct, given that it requires specific hardware. Cisco has a long history of building new model series of switches with model numbers     that begin with 2960. Per Cisco’s documenta-tion, Cisco created one stacking technology, called FlexStack, as part of the introduction of the 2960-S model series. Cisco later enhanced FlexStack with FlexStack-Plus, adding support with products in the 2960-X and 2960-XR model series. For switch stacking to sup-port future designs, the stacking hardware tends to increase over time as well, as seen in the comparisons between FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus in Table 6-3. \\nTable 6-3 Comparisons of Cisco’s FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus Options\\nFlexStack FlexStack-Plus\\nY ear introduced 2010 2013\\nSwitch model series 2960-S, 2960-X 2960-X, 2960-XR\\nSpeed of single stack link, in both directions (full duplex) 10 Gbps 20 Gbps\\nMaximum number of switches in one stack 4 8\\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  159\\nChassis Aggregation \\nThe term chassis aggregation refers   to another Cisco technology used to make multiple \\nswitches operate as a single switch. From a big picture perspective, switch stacking is more often used and offered by Cisco in switches meant for the access layer. Chassis aggregation is meant for more powerful switches that sit in the distribution and core layers. Summarizing some     of the key differences, chassis aggregation\\n■Typically is used for higher-end switches used as distribution or core switches\\n■Does not require special hardware adapters, instead using Ethernet interfaces\\n■Aggregates two switches\\n■Arguably is more complex but also more functional\\nThe big idea of chassis aggregation is the same as for a switch stack: make multiple switches act like one switch, which gives you some availability and design advantages. But much of the driving force behind chassis aggregation is about high-availability design for LANs. This section works through a few of those thoughts to give you the big ideas about the thinking behind high availability for the core and distribution layer.\\nNOTE This section looks at the general ideas of chassis aggregation, but for further read-ing about a specific implementation, search at Cisco.com for Cisco’s Virtual Switching System (VSS) that is supported on 6500 and 6800 series switches.\\nHigh Availability with a Distribution/Core Switch\\nEven without chassis aggregation, the         distribution and core switches need to have high avail-ability. The next few pages look at how the switches built for use as distribution and core switches can help improve availability, even without chassis aggregation.\\nIf you were to look around a medium to large enterprise campus LAN, you would typically \\nfind many more access switches than distribution and core switches. For instance, you might have four access switches per floor, with ten floors in a building, for 40 access switches. That same building probably has only a pair of distribution switches. \\nAnd why two distribution switches instead of one? Because if the design used only one dis-\\ntribution switch, and it failed, none of the devices in the building could reach the rest of the network. So, if two distribution switches are good, why not four? Or eight? One reason is cost, another complexity. Done right, a pair of distribution switches for a building can pro-vide the right balance of high availability and low cost/complexity.\\nThe availability features of typical distribution and core switches allow network design-\\ners to create a great availability design with just two distribution or core switches. Cisco makes typical distribution/core switches with more redundancy. For instance, Figure 6-17 shows a representation of a typical chassis-based Cisco switch. It has slots that can be used for line cards—that is, cards with Ethernet ports. It has dual supervisor cards that do frame and packet forwarding. And it has two power supplies, each of which can be connected to power feeds from different electrical substations if desired.\\nptg17396363160  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPower\\nSupply 2Second PowerFeedFirst Power\\nFeedPowerSupply 1Line CardLine CardLine CardSupervisor 2Supervisor 1Line CardLine Card\\nFigure 6-17 Common Line-Card Arrangement in a Modular Cisco Distribution/Core \\nSwitch\\nNow imagine two distribution switches sitting beside each other in a wiring closet as shown \\nin Figure 6-18. A design would usually connect the two switches with an EtherChannel. For better availability, the EtherChannel could use ports from different line cards, so that         if one line card failed due to some hardware problem, the EtherChannel would still work.\\nPower\\nSupply 2PowerSupply 1Line CardLine CardLine CardSupervisor 2Supervisor 1Line CardLine Card\\nPowerSupply 2 PowerSupply 1Line CardLine CardLine CardSupervisor 2Supervisor 1Line CardLine CardL2 or L3\\nEtherChannel\\nFigure 6-18 Using EtherChannel and Different Line Cards\\nImproving Design and Availability with Chassis Aggregation\\nNext, consider the effect of adding chassis aggregation to a pair of distribution switches. In \\nterms of effect, the two switches act as one switch, much      like switch stacking. The particu-lars of how chassis aggregation achieves that differs. \\nFigure 6-19 shows a comparison. On the left, the two distribution switches act indepen-\\ndently, and on the right, the two distribution switches are aggregated. In both cases, each distribution switch connects with a single Layer 2 link to the access layer switches A1 and A2, which act independently—that is, they do not use switch stacking. So, the only differ-ence between the left and right examples is that on the right the distribution switches use switch aggregation. \\nThe right side of the figure shows the aggregated switch that appears as one switch to \\nthe access layer switches. In fact, even though the uplinks connect into two different switches, they can be configured as an EtherChannel through a feature called Multichassis EtherChannel (MEC). \\nptg173963636Chapter 6: Miscellaneous LAN Topics  161\\nChassis 1 Chassis 2\\nA1 A2 A1 A2Aggregated Switch\\nFigure 6-19 One Design Advantage of Aggregated Distribution Switches\\nThe following list describes some of the advantages of using switch aggregation. Note that \\nmany of the benefits should sound familiar from the switch   stacking discussion. The one difference in this list has to do with the active/active data plane.\\nMultichassis EtherChannel (MEC): Uses the   EtherChannel between the two physical \\nswitches.\\nActive/Standby Control Plane: Simpler operation for control plane because the pair \\nacts as one switch for control plane protocols: STP, VTP, EtherChannel, ARP, routing protocols.\\nActive/Active data plane: Takes advantage of forwarding power of supervisors on both \\nswitches, with active Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding the supervisors of both switches. The switches synchronize their MAC and routing tables to support that process.\\nSingle switch management: Simpler operation of management protocols by running man-\\nagement protocols (Telnet, SSH, SNMP) on the   active switch; configuration is synchro-nized automatically with the standby switch.\\nFinally, using chassis aggregation and switch stacking together in the same network has \\nsome great design advantages. Look back to Figure 6-13 at     the beginning of this section. It showed two distribution switches and four access switches, all acting independently, with one uplink from each access switch to each distribution switch. If you enable switch stack-ing for the four access switches, and enable chassis aggregation for the two distribution switches, you end up with a topology as shown in Figure 6-20.\\nA1 A2 A3 A4\\nSwitch StackAggregated Switch\\nSTP Forward\\nSTP Forward8 Link EtherChannel\\nFigure 6-20 Making Six Switches Act like Two\\nptg17396363162  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

It is the OSPF that has been part of CCNA R&S throughout most of the his-tory of CCNA R&S. \\nThis chapter has three major sections. The first section sets a bit of context about rout-\\ning protocols in general, defining interior and exterior routing protocols and basic routing protocol features and terms. This information is duplicated somewhat in the ICND1 Cert Guide, but the exam topics of both the ICND1 and ICND2 Cert Guides include these top-ics, so the topics are covered here as well. The second major section presents the nuts and bolts of how OSPFv2 works, using OSPF neighbor relationships, database exchange, and then route calculation. The third section wraps up the discussion by looking at some OSPF design issues.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Before we get too far into the discussion, however, it is important to define a few related terms and clear up any misconcep-tions about the terms routing protocol, routed protocol, and routable protocol. The concepts \\nbehind these terms are not that difficult, but because the terms are so similar, and because many documents pay poor attention to when each of these terms is used, they can be a bit confusing. These terms are generally defined as follows:\\n■Routing protocol: A set of   messages, rules, and algorithms used by routers for the overall\\npurpose of learning routes. This process includes the exchange and analysis of routing infor-mation. Each router chooses the best route to each subnet (path selection) and finally placesthose best routes in its IP routing table. Examples include RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.\\n■Routed protocol and routable protocol: Both terms refer to a protocol that defines apacket structure     and logical addressing, allowing routers to forward or route the packets.Routers forward packets defined by routed and routable protocols. Examples include IPVersion 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).\\nNOTE The term path selection sometimes    refers to part of the job of a routing protocol, in \\nwhich the routing protocol chooses the best route.\\nEven though routing protocols (such as OSPF) are different from routed protocols (such as IP), they do work together very closely. The routing process forwards IP packets, but if a router does not have any routes in its IP routing table that match a packet’s destination address, the router discards the packet. Routers need routing protocols so that the routers can learn all the possible routes and add them to the routing table, so that the routing process can forward (route) routable protocols such as IP.\\nRouting Protocol Functions\\nCisco IOS software supports several   IP routing protocols, performing the same general functions:\\n1. Learn routing information about IP subnets from neighboring routers.\\n2. Advertise routing information about IP subnets to neighboring routers.\\n3. If more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based on\\na metric.\\n4. If the network topology changes—for example, a link fails—react by advertising that someroutes have failed and pick a new currently best route. (This process is called convergence.)\\nNOTE A neighboring router connects to the same link as another router, such as the same \\nWAN link or the same Ethernet LAN.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 D 2 C, D 3 B, C, D 4 C 5 B 6 C\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  173\\nFigure 7-1 shows an example of three of the four functions in the list. Both R1 and R3 learn \\nabout a route to subnet 172.16.3.0/24 from R2 (function 1). After R3 learns about the route to 172.16.3.0/24 from R2, R3 advertises that route to R1 (function 2). Then R1 must make a decision about the two routes it learned about for reaching subnet 172.16.3.0/24: one with metric 1 from R2 and one with metric 2 from R3. R1 chooses the lower   metric route through R2 (function 3).\\nG0/1S0/0/0S0/0/1S0/0/1 S0/0/0\\nG0/0S0/0/0\\n172.16.6.252\\nS0/0/1\\n172.16.2.252G0/0\\nI have a route to172.16.3.0/24, metric 2.I have a route to172.16.3.0/24, metric 1.\\nI have a route to172.16.3.0/24, metric 1.R1 IP Routing Table\\nSubnet        Out Int.

The term convergence \\nrefers to a process that occurs when the topology changes—that is, when either a router or link fails or comes back up again. When something changes, the best routes available in the network can change. Convergence simply refers to the process by which all the routers col-lectively realize something has changed, advertise the information about the changes to all the other routers, and all the routers then choose the currently best routes for each subnet. The ability to converge quickly, without causing loops, is one of the most important consid-erations when choosing which IP routing protocol to use.\\nIn Figure 7-1, convergence might occur if the link between R1 and R2 failed. In that case, \\nR1 should stop using its old route for subnet 172.16.3.0/24 (directly through R2) and begin sending packets to R3.\\nInterior and Exterior Routing Protocols\\nIP routing protocols fall into one of two major categories: interior gateway protocols (IGP) or exterior gateway protocols (EGP). The definitions of each are as follows:\\n■IGP: A routing protocol that was     designed and intended for use inside a single autono-\\nmous system (AS)\\n■EGP: A routing protocol that was designed     and intended for use between differentautonomous systems\\nptg17396363174  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE The terms IGP and EGP include the word “gateway” because routers used to be \\ncalled gateways.\\nThese definitions use another new term: autonomous system (AS). An AS    is a network under the administrative control of a single organization. For example, a network created and paid for by a single company is probably a single AS, and a network created by a single school system is probably a single AS. Other examples include large divisions of a state or national government, where different government agencies might be able to build their own networks. Each ISP is also typically a single different AS.\\nSome routing protocols work best inside    a single AS by design, so these routing protocols \\nare called IGPs. Conversely, routing protocols designed to exchange routes between routers in different autonomous systems are called EGPs. Today,    Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the only EGP used.\\nEach AS can be assigned    a number called (unsurprisingly) an AS number (ASN). Like public \\nIP addresses, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, http://www.iana.org) con-trols the worldwide rights to assigning      ASNs. It delegates that authority to other organiza-tions around the world, typically to the same organizations that assign public IP addresses. For example, in North America, the American Registry for Internet    Numbers (ARIN, http://www.arin.net) assigns public IP address ranges and ASNs.\\nFigure 7-2 shows a small view of the worldwide Internet. The figure shows two enterprises \\nand three ISPs using IGPs (OSPF and EIGRP) inside their own networks and with BGP being used between the ASNs.\\nEnterprise 1\\nSubnets of Network9.0.0.0EIGRPBGPASN 100\\nEnterprise 5Subnets of Network199.190.1.0OSPFASN 500\\nISP3\\nOSPF\\nISP2\\nEIGRPASN 200\\nASN 400\\nASN 300BGP\\nBGPBGPBGP\\nISP4\\nEIGRP\\nFigure 7-2 Comparing Locations for Using IGPs and EGPs\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  175\\nComparing IGPs\\nOrganizations have several options when choosing an IGP for their enterprise network, but \\nmost companies today use either OSPF or EIGRP. This book discusses both these routing protocols, with Chapters 7 and 8 covering OSPF and Chapters 9 and 10 covering EIGRP. Before getting into detail on these two protocols, the next section first discusses some of the main goals of every IGP, comparing OSPF, EIGRP, plus a few other IPv4 routing protocols.\\nIGP Routing Protocol Algorithms\\nA routing protocol’s underlying       algorithm determines how the routing protocol does its job. The term routing protocol algorithm simply refers to the logic and processes used by different routing protocols to solve the problem of learning all routes, choosing the best route to each subnet, and converging in reaction to changes in the internetwork. Three main branches of routing protocol algorithms exist for IGP routing protocols:\\n■Distance vector (sometimes called Bellman-Ford after its creators)\\n■Advanced distance vector (sometimes called “balanced hybrid”)\\n■Link-state\\nHistorically speaking, distance vector protocols            were invented first, mainly in the early 1980s. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) was the first popularly used IP distance vector protocol, with the Cisco-proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being intro-duced a little later.\\nBy the early 1990s, distance vector protocols’ somewhat slow convergence and potential \\nfor routing loops drove the development of new alternative     routing protocols that used new algorithms. Link-state protocols—in particular, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and   Integrated Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)—solved the main issues. They also came with a price: They required extra CPU and memory on routers, with more planning required from the network engineers.\\nAround the same time as the introduction of OSPF, Cisco created a proprietary routing pro-\\ntocol called      Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), which used some fea-tures of the earlier IGRP protocol. EIGRP solved the same problems as did link-state routing protocols, but less planning was required when implementing the network. As time went on, EIGRP was classified as a unique type of routing protocol. However, it used more distance vector features than link-state, so it is more commonly classified as an advanced       distance vector protocol.\\nMetrics\\nRouting protocols choose the best route      to reach a subnet by choosing the route with the lowest metric. For example, RIP uses a counter of the number of routers (hops) between a router and the destination subnet. OSPF totals the cost associated with each interface in the end-to-end route, with the cost based on link bandwidth. Table 7-2 lists the most important IP routing protocols for the CCNA exams and some details about the metric in each case.\\nptg17396363176  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 7-2 IP IGP Metrics\\nIGP Metric Description\\nRIPv2 Hop count The number of routers (hops) between a router and the \\ndestination subnet\\nOSPF Cost The sum of all interface cost settings for all links in a route, with the cost defaulting to be based on interface bandwidth\\nEIGRP Composite of \\nbandwidth and delayCalculated based on the route’s slowest link and the cumulative delay associated with each interface in the route\\nA brief comparison of the metric used by the older RIP versus the metric used by EIGRP \\nshows some insight into why OSPF and EIGRP surpassed RIP. Figure 7-3 shows an example in which Router B has two possible routes to subnet 10.1.1.0 on the left side of the net-work: a shorter route over a very slow 64-Kbps link, or a longer   route over two higher-speed (T1) links.\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1RIP\\nBandwidth 64\\nBandwidth \\n1544Bandwidth \\n1544S0/0/0S0/0/1Subnet 10.1.1.0EIGRP\\nBandwidth 64\\nBandwidth \\n1544A B\\nCA B\\nCBandwidth \\n1544\\nFigure 7-3 RIP and EIGRP Metrics Compared\\nThe left side of the figure shows the results of RIP in this network. Using hop count, Router B learns of a one-hop route directly to Router A through B’s S0/0/1 interface. B also learns of a two-hop route through Router C, through B’s S0/0/0 interface. Router B chooses the lower hop count route, which happens to go over the slow-speed link.\\nThe right side of the figure shows the arguably better choice made by EIGRP based on its \\nbetter metric. To cause EIGRP to make the right choice, the engineer correctly configured the interface bandwidth to match the actual link speeds, thereby allowing EIGRP to choose the faster route. (The bandwidth interface subcommand does not change the actual physical      speed of the interface. It just tells IOS what speed to assume the interface is using.)\\nOther IGP Comparisons\\nSome other IGP comparisons can be made. However, some topics require more fundamen-tal knowledge of specific routing protocols, or other features not yet covered in this book. For now, this section introduces a few more comparison points, and leaves the details until later in the book.\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  177\\nRouting protocols differ based on whether they are classless routing protocols or classful. \\nClassless        routing protocols support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) as well as manual route summarization. Classless routing protocols support VLSM and manual route summa-rization by sending routing protocol messages that include the subnet masks in the message, whereas the generally older classful routing protocols do not send masks in the routing update messages. Table 7-3 summarizes the key IGP comparison points.\\nTable 7-3 Interior IP Routing Protocols Compared\\nFeature RIPv1 RIPv2 EIGRP OSPF IS-IS\\nClassless/sends mask in updates/supports VLSM No Y es Y es Y es Y es\\nAlgorithm (DV , advanced DV , LS) DV DV Advanced \\nDVLS LS\\nSupports manual summarization No Y es Y es Y es Y es\\nCisco-proprietary No No Y es1No No\\nRouting updates are sent to a multicast IP address No Y es Y es Y es —Convergence Slow Slow Fast Fast Fast\\n1 Although Cisco created EIGRP , and has kept it as a proprietary protocol for many years, Cisco chose to \\npublish EIGRP as an informational RFC in 2013. This allows other vendors to implement EIGRP , while Cisco \\nretains the rights to the protocol.\\nAdministrative Distance\\nMany companies and organizations use a single routing protocol. However, in some cases, a \\ncompany needs to use multiple routing protocols. For example, if two companies connect their networks so that they can exchange information, they need to exchange some routing information. If one company uses OSPF, and the other uses EIGRP, on at least one router, both OSPF and EIGRP must be used. Then, that router can take routes learned by OSPF and advertise them into EIGRP, and vice versa, through a    process called route redistribution.\\nDepending on the network topology, the two routing protocols might learn routes to the \\nsame subnets. When a single routing protocol learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the metric tells it which route is best. However, when two different routing protocols learn routes to the same subnet, because each routing protocol’s metric is based on different information, IOS cannot compare the metrics. For example, OSPF might learn a route to subnet 10.1.1.0 with metric 101, and EIGRP might learn a route to 10.1.1.0 with metric 2,195,416, but the EIGRP-learned route might be the better route—or it might not. There is simply no basis for comparison between the two metrics.\\nWhen IOS must choose between routes learned using different routing protocols, IOS uses \\na concept called    administrative distance. Administrative distance is a number that denotes \\nhow believable an entire routing protocol is on a single router. The lower the number, the better, or more believable, the routing protocol. For example, RIP has a default administra-tive distance of 120, OSPF uses a default of 110, and EIGRP defaults to 90. When using OSPF and EIGRP, the router will believe the EIGRP route instead of the OSPF route (at least by default). The administrative distance values are configured on a single router and are not exchanged with other routers. Table 7-4 lists the various sources of routing information, along with the default administrative distances.\\nptg17396363178  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 7-4 Default Administrative Distances\\nRoute Type Administrative Distance\\nConnected 0\\nStatic 1\\nBGP (external routes) 20\\nEIGRP (internal routes) 90\\nIGRP 100\\nOSPF 110\\nIS-IS 115\\nRIP 120\\nEIGRP (external routes) 170\\nBGP (internal routes) 200\\nDHCP default route 254\\nUnusable 255\\nNOTE The show ip route command   lists each route’s administrative distance as the first of \\nthe two numbers inside the brackets. The second number in brackets is the metric.\\nThe table shows the default    administrative distance values, but IOS can be configured \\nto change the administrative distance of a particular routing protocol, a particular route, or even a static route. For example, the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 defines a static route with a default administrative distance of 1, but the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 210 defines the same static \\nroute with an administrative distance of 210. So, you can actually create a static route that is only used when the routing protocol does not find a route, just by giving the static route a higher administrative distance.\\nOSPF Concepts and Operation\\nRouting protocols basically exchange information so routers can learn routes. The routers learn information about subnets, routes to those subnets, and metric information about how good each route is compared to others. The routing protocol can then choose the currently best route to each subnet, building the IP routing table.\\nLink-state protocols like OSPF take a little different approach to the particulars of what \\ninformation they exchange and what the routers do with that information once learned. This next (second) major section narrows the focus to only link-state protocols, specifically OSPF.\\nThis section begins with an overview of what OSPF does by exchanging data about the net-\\nwork in data structures called link-state advertisements (LSA). Then, the discussion backs up a bit to provide more details about each of three fundamental parts of how OSPF oper-ates: how OSPF routers use neighbor relationships, how routers exchange LSAs with neigh-bors, and then how routers calculate the best routes once they learn all the LSAs. \\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  179\\nOSPF Overview\\nLink-state protocols build IP routes with a couple of major steps. First, the routers together \\nbuild a lot of information about the network: routers, links, IP addresses, status information, and so on. Then the routers flood the information, so all routers know the same informa-tion. At that point, each router can calculate routes to all subnets, but from each router’s own perspective.\\nTopology Information and LSAs\\nRouters using link-state      routing protocols need to collectively advertise practically every detail about the internetwork to all the other routers. At the end of the process   of flooding \\nthe information to all routers, every router in the internetwork has the exact same informa-tion about the internetwork. Flooding a lot of detailed information to every router sounds like a lot of work, and relative to distance vector routing protocols, it is.\\nOpen Shortest Path First (OSPF), the most popular link-state IP routing protocol, organizes \\ntopology information using LSAs and the link-state database (LSDB). Figure 7-4 represents the ideas. Each LSA is a data structure with some specific information about the network topology; the LSDB is simply the collection of all the         LSAs known to a router. When sitting at the CLI of a router that uses OSPF, the show ip ospf database command lists informa-tion about the LSDB on that router by listing some of the information in each of the LSAs in the LSDB.\\nLSA\\nLSA\\nLSA\\nLSA\\nLSA\\nLSALink State Database (LSDB)\\nFigure 7-4 LSA and LSDB Relationship\\nFigure 7-5 shows the general idea of the flooding process, with R8 creating and flooding its router LSA. The router LSA for Router R8 describes the router itself, including the exis-tence of subnet 172.16.3.0/24, as seen on the right side     of the figure. (Note that Figure 7-5 actually shows only a subset of the information in R8’s router LSA.)\\nFigure 7-5 shows the rather basic flooding process, with R8 sending the original LSA for \\nitself, and the other routers flooding the LSA by forwarding it until every router has a copy. The flooding process has a way to prevent loops so     that the LSAs do not get flooded around in circles. Basically, before sending an LSA to yet another neighbor, routers com-municate, asking “Do you already have this LSA?,” and then they avoid flooding the LSA to neighbors that already have it.\\nOnce flooded, routers do occasionally reflood a particular LSA. Routers reflood an LSA \\nwhen some information changes (for example, when a link goes up or comes down). They also reflood each LSA based on each LSA’s separate aging timer (default 30 minutes).\\nptg17396363180  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFa0/0172.16.3.0/24\\n172.16.3.1/24\\nCost 10R8 LSA R8 LSA R8 LSAR8 LSA R8 LSA\\nR8 LSA R8 LSA\\nR8 LSA R8 LSA\\nR8 Router LSA – Partial Contents\\nRouter ID:          8.8.8.8\\nInt.

Although incredibly detailed and useful, the information in the LSDB does not explicitly state each router’s best route to reach a destination.\\nTo build routes, link-state routers           have to do some math. Thankfully, you and I do not have \\nto know the math! However, all link-state protocols use a type of math algorithm, called the Dijkstra Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, to process the LSDB. That algorithm analyzes (with math) the LSDB, and builds the routes that the local router should add to the IP rout-ing table—routes that list a subnet number and mask, an outgoing interface, and a next-hop router IP address.\\nNow that you have the big ideas down, the next several topics walk through the three main \\nphases of how OSPF routers accomplish the work of exchanging LSAs and calculating routes. Those three phases are \\nBecoming neighbors: A relationship between two routers that connect to the same data \\nlink, created so that the neighboring routers have a means to exchange their LSDBs.\\nExchanging databases: The process of sending LSAs to neighbors so that all routers learn \\nthe same LSAs.\\nAdding the best routes: The process of each router independently running SPF, on their \\nlocal copy of the LSDB, calculating the best routes, and adding those to the IPv4 routing table.\\nBecoming OSPF Neighbors\\nOf everything you learn about OSPF in this chapter, OSPF neighbor concepts have the most \\nto do with how you will configure and troubleshoot OSPF in Cisco routers. You configure OSPF in ways that make routers become neighbors, and much of the LSA exchange process \\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  181\\nand calculating the best routes happen in the background. This section discusses the funda-\\nmental concepts of OSPF neighbors.\\nThe Basics of OSPF Neighbors\\nOSPF neighbors are routers that    both use OSPF and both sit on the same data link. With the data link technology discussed so far in this book, that means two routers connected to the same VLAN become OSPF neighbors, or two routers on the ends of a serial link become OSPF neighbors.\\nTwo routers need to do more than simply exist on the same link to become OSPF neigh-\\nbors; they must send OSPF messages and agree to become neighbors. To do so, the rout-ers send OSPF Hello messages, introducing themselves to the neighbor. Assuming the two neighbors have compatible OSPF parameters, the two form a neighbor relationship, and would be displayed in the output of the show ip ospf neighbors command.\\nThe OSPF neighbor relationship also lets OSPF know when a neighbor might not be a good \\noption for routing packets right now. Imagine R1 and R2 form a neighbor relationship, learn LSAs, and calculate routes that send packets through the other router. Months later, R1 notices that the neighbor relationship with R2 fails. That failed neighbor connection to R2 makes R1 react: R1 refloods LSAs that formerly relied on the link from R1 to R2, and R1 runs SPF to recalculate its own routes.\\nFinally, the OSPF neighbor model allows new routers to be dynamically discovered. That \\nmeans new routers can be added to a network without requiring every router to be recon-figured. Instead, the configuration enables OSPF on a router’s interfaces, and then the router reacts to any Hello messages from new neighbors, whenever those    neighbors happen to be installed.\\nMeeting Neighbors and Learning Their Router ID\\nThe OSPF Hello process, by which    new neighbor relationships are formed, works somewhat like when you move to a new house and meet your various neighbors. When you see each other outside, you might walk over, say hello, and learn each other’s name. After talking a bit, you form a first impression, particularly as to whether you think you’ll enjoy chatting with this neighbor occasionally, or whether you can just wave and not take the time to talk the next time you see him outside.\\nSimilarly, with OSPF, the process starts with messages called      OSPF Hello messages. The \\nHellos in turn list each router’s   router ID (RID), which serves as each router’s unique name or identifier for OSPF. Finally, OSPF does several checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers should become neighbors.\\nOSPF RIDs are 32-bit numbers. As a     result, most command output lists these as dotted-\\ndecimal numbers (DDN). Additionally, by default, IOS chooses its OSPF RID based on an active interface IPv4 address, because those are some nearby convenient 32-bit numbers as well. However, the OSPF RID can be directly configured, as covered in the section “Configuring the OSPF Router ID” in Chapter 8, “Implementing OSPF for IPv4.”\\nAs soon as a router has chosen its OSPF RID and some interfaces come up, the router is \\nready to meet its OSPF neighbors. OSPF routers can become neighbors if they are con-nected to the same subnet (and in some other special cases not covered on the CCENT and \\nptg17396363182  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nCCNA exams). To discover other OSPF-speaking routers, a router sends multicast OSPF \\nHello packets to each interface and hopes to receive OSPF Hello packets      from other routers connected to those interfaces. Figure 7-6 outlines the basic concept.\\nHello\\nIntervalHello\\nHelloHelloIntervalHello\\nHelloB A\\nFigure 7-6 OSPF Hello Packets\\nRouters A and B both send Hello messages onto the LAN. They continue to send Hellos at \\na regular interval based on their Hello timer settings. The Hello messages      themselves have the following features:\\n■The Hello message follows the IP packet header, with IP protocol type 89.\\n■Hello packets are sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.5, a multicast IP address intended\\nfor all OSPF-speaking routers.\\n■OSPF routers listen for packets sent to IP multicast address 224.0.0.5, in part hoping to\\nreceive Hello packets and learn about new neighbors.\\nTaking a closer look, Figure 7-7 shows several of the neighbor states used by the early for-mation of an OSPF neighbor relationship. The figure shows the Hello messages in the center and the resulting neighbor states on the left and right edges     of the figure. Each router keeps an OSPF state variable for how it views the neighbor.\\nHello, Seen [null], My RID 1.1.1.1RID 1.1.1.1 RID 2.2.2.2\\nHello, Seen [1.1.1.1], My RID 2.2.2.2\\nHello, Seen [1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2], My RID 1.1.1.1(R1 to R2 Link comes up…)R1 R2\\nInit\\n2-Way2-Way1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nFigure 7-7 Early Neighbor States\\nFollowing the steps in the figure, the scenario begins with the link down, so the routers have no knowledge of each other as OSPF neighbors. As a result, they have no state (status) information about each       other as neighbors, and they would not list each other in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command. At Step 2, R1 sends the first Hello, so R2 learns \\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  183\\nof the existence of R1 as an OSPF router. At that point, R2 lists R1 as a neighbor, with an \\ninterim beginning state of init.\\nThe process continues at Step 3, with R2 sending back a Hello. This message tells R1 that R2 \\nexists, and it allows R1 to move through the init state and quickly to a 2-way state. At Step 4, R2 receives the next Hello from R1, and R2 can also move to a 2-way state.\\nThe 2-way state is a particularly important OSPF state. At that point, the following major \\nfacts are true:\\n■The router received a Hello from the neighbor, with that router’s own RID listed as being\\nseen by the neighbor.\\n■The router has checked all the parameters in the Hello received from the neighbor, with\\nno problems. The router is willing to become a neighbor.\\n■If both routers reach a 2-way state with each other, it means that both routers meet all\\nOSPF configuration requirements to become neighbors. Effectively, at that point, they\\nare neighbors, and ready to exchange their LSDB with each     other.\\nExchanging the LSDB Between Neighbors\\nOne purpose of forming OSPF neighbor relationships is to allow the two neighbors to \\nexchange their databases. This next topic works through some of the details of OSPF data-base exchange. \\nFully Exchanging LSAs with Neighbors\\nThe OSPF neighbor      state 2-way means that the router is available to exchange its LSDB with the neighbor. In other words, it is ready to begin a 2-way exchange of the LSDB. So, once two routers on a point-to-point link reach the 2-way state, they can immediately move on to the process of database exchange.\\nThe database exchange process can be quite involved, with several OSPF messages and sev-\\neral interim neighbor states. This chapter is more concerned with a few of the messages and the final state when database exchange has completed: the full state.\\nAfter two routers decide to exchange databases, they do not simply send the contents of \\nthe entire database. First, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not all the details of the LSAs, just a list. (Think of these lists as checklists.) Then, each router can check which LSAs it already has, and then ask the other router for only the LSAs that are not known yet.\\nFor instance, R1 might send R2 a checklist that lists ten LSAs (using an OSPF Database \\nDescription, or DD, packet). R2 then checks its LSDB and finds six of those ten LSAs. So, R2 asks R1 (using a Link-State Request packet) to send the four additional LSAs.\\nThankfully, most OSPFv2 work does not require detailed knowledge of these specific pro-\\ntocol steps. However, a few of the terms are used quite a bit and should be remembered. In particular, the OSPF messages that actually send the LSAs between neighbors are     called Link-State Update (LSU) packets. That is, the LSU packet holds data structures called link-state advertisements (LSA). The LSAs are not packets, but rather data structures that sit inside the LSDB and describe the topology.\\nptg17396363184  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 7-8 pulls some of these terms and processes together, with a general example. The \\nstory picks up the example shown in Figure 7-7, with Figure 7-8 showing an example of the database exchange process between Routers R1 and R2. The center shows the protocol messages, and the outer items show the neighbor states at different points in the process. Focus on two items in particular:\\n■The routers exchange the LSAs inside LSU packets.\\n■When finished, the routers reach a full state, meaning      they have fully exchanged the\\ncontents of their LSDBs.\\nDatabase DescriptionRID 1.1.1.1 RID 2.2.2.2\\nDatabase Description\\nLSU, with Several LSAsR1 R2\\nExchange\\nLoading Loading\\nFull FullExStart\\nLSU, with Several LSAs\\n.\\n..\\nFigure 7-8 Database Exchange Example, Ending in a Full State\\nMaintaining Neighbors and the LSDB\\nOnce two neighbors reach a full state, they have done all the initial work to exchange OSPF \\ninformation between them. However, neighbors       still have to do some small ongoing tasks to maintain the neighbor relationship.\\nFirst, routers monitor each neighbor relationship using Hello messages and two related \\ntimers: the Hello Interval and    the Dead Interval. Routers send Hellos every Hello Interval to each neighbor. Each router expects to receive a Hello from each neighbor based on the Hello Interval, so if a neighbor is silent for the length of the Dead Interval (by default, four times as long as the Hello Interval), the loss of Hellos means that the neighbor has failed.\\nNext, routers must react when the topology changes as well, and neighbors play a key role \\nin that process. When something changes, one or more routers change one or more LSAs. Then, the routers must flood the changed LSAs to each neighbor so that the neighbor can change its LSDB.\\nFor example, imagine a LAN switch loses power, so a router’s G0/0 interface fails from \\nup/up to down/down. That router updates an LSA that shows the router’s G0/0 as being down. That router then sends the LSA to its neighbors, and that neighbor in turn send it to its neighbors, until all routers again have an identical copy of the LSDB. Each router’s LSDB now reflects the fact that the original router’s G0/0 interface failed, so each router will then use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed interface.\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  185\\nA third maintenance task done by neighbors is to reflood each LSA occasionally, even when \\nthe network is completely stable. By default, each router that creates an LSA also has the responsibility to reflood the LSA every 30 minutes (the default), even if no changes occur. (Note that each LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created, so there is no single big event where the network is overloaded with flooding LSAs.)\\nThe following list summarizes these three maintenance tasks for easier review:\\n■Maintain neighbor state by sending Hello messages based on the Hello Interval, and lis-\\ntening for Hellos before the Dead Interval expires\\n■Flood any changed LSAs to each neighbor\\n■Reflood unchanged LSAs       as their lifetime expires (default 30 minutes)\\nNOTE If you are curious to know a few more details about the LSAs themselves, \\nAppendix K’s section titled “(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements” provides a few more details. \\nUsing Designated Routers on Ethernet Links\\nOSPF behaves differently            on some types of interfaces, particularly comparing point-to-point and Ethernet links. In particular, on Ethernet links, OSPF elects one of the routers on the same subnet to act as the designated router (DR). The DR plays a key role in how the database exchange process works, with different rules than with point-to-point links. To see how, consider the example that begins with Figure 7-9. The figure shows five OSPFv2 rout-ers on the same Ethernet VLAN. These five OSPF routers elect one router to act as the DR, and one router to be    backup DR (BDR). The figure shows A and B as DR and BDR, for no other reason than the Ethernet must have one of each.\\nDRA C E\\nB DBDR\\nFigure 7-9 Routers A and B Elected as DR and BDR\\nThe database exchange process on an Ethernet link does not happen between every pair of routers on the same VLAN/subnet. Instead, it happens between the DR and each of the other routers, with the DR making sure that all the other routers get a copy of each LSA. In other words, the database exchange happens over the flows shown in Figure 7-10.\\nDesignated Router\\nB C D EA\\nDatabase Exchange Flows\\nFigure 7-10 Database Exchange to and from the DR on an Ethernet\\nptg17396363186  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nOSPF uses the BDR concept because the DR is so important to the database exchange pro-\\ncess. The BDR watches the status of the DR and takes over         for the DR if it fails. (When the DR fails, the BDR takes over, and then a new BDR is elected.)\\nAt this point, you might be getting a little tired of some of the theory, but finally, the \\ntheory actually shows something that you may see in show commands on a router. Because the DR and BDR both do full database exchange with all the other OSPF routers in the LAN, they reach a full state with all neighbors. However, routers that are neither a DR nor a BDR—called DROthers by OSPF—never   reach a full state because they do not do database \\nexchange with each other. As a result, the show ip ospf neighbor command on these rout-ers lists some neighbors, permanently, in a state of 2-way, and not in a full state.\\nFor instance, with OSPF working normally on the Ethernet LAN in Figure 7-10, a show \\nip ospf neighbor command on router C (which is a DROther router) would show the \\nfollowing:\\n■Two neighbors (A and B, the DR and BDR, respectively) with a full state (called fully\\nadjacent)\\n■Two neighbors (D and E) with a 2-way state         (called adjacent)\\nThis different behavior on OSPF neighbors on a LAN—where some neighbors reach full state and some do not—calls       for the use of two more OSPF terms: adjacent and fully adja-cent. Fully adjacent neighbors reach a full state after having exchanged their LSDBs directly. Adjacent neighbors are those DROther routers that (correctly) choose to stay in 2-way state but never reach a full state. Table 7-5 summarizes these key concepts and terms related to OSPF states.\\nTable 7-5 Stable OSPF Neighbor States and Their Meanings\\nNeighbor \\nStateAdjacency LingoMeaning\\n2-way Adjacent The neighbor  has sent a Hello that lists the local router’s RID in the \\nlist of seen routers, also implying that neighbor verification checks all passed. If both neighbors are DROther routers, the neighbors should remain in this state.\\nFull Fully \\nadjacentBoth routers know the exact same  LSDB details and are fully adjacent, meaning they have completed the exchange of LSDB contents.\\nCalculating the Best Routes with SPF\\nOSPF LSAs contain     useful information, but they do not contain the specific information \\nthat a router needs to add to its IPv4 routing table. In other words, a router cannot just copy information from the LSDB into a route in the IPv4 routing table. The LSAs individually are more like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. So, to know what routes to add to the routing table, each router must do some SPF math to choose the best routes from that router’s perspec-tive. The router then adds each route to its routing table: a route with a subnet number and mask, an outgoing interface, and a next-hop router IP address.\\nAlthough engineers do not need to know the details of how SPF does the math, they do \\nneed to know how to predict which routes SPF will choose as the best route. The SPF algo-rithm calculates all the routes for a subnet—that is, all possible routes from the router to \\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  187\\nthe destination subnet. If more than one route exists, the router compares the metrics, pick-\\ning the best (lowest) metric route to add to the routing table. Although the SPF math can be complex, engineers with a network diagram, router status information, and simple addition can calculate the metric for each route, predicting what SPF will choose.\\nOnce SPF has identified a route, OSPF calculates the metric for a route as follows:\\nThe sum of the OSPF interface costs for all outgoing interfaces in the route\\nFigure 7-11 shows an example with three     possible routes from R1 to Subnet X \\n(172.16.3.0/24) at the bottom of the figure.\\nCost 20\\nCost 30Cost 30 Cost 10\\nCost 60\\nCost 20 Cost 180\\nCost 5\\nCost 10\\nSubnet X\\n(172.16.3.0/24)Cost 40\\nPossible RouteR1\\nR2\\nR3 R7\\nR4R5\\nR6\\nR8Legend:\\nFigure 7-11 SPF Tree to Find R1’s Route to 172.16.3.0/24\\nNOTE OSPF considers the costs of the outgoing interfaces (only) in each route. It does \\nnot add the cost for incoming interfaces in the route.\\nTable 7-6 lists the three routes shown in Figure 7-11, with their cumulative costs, showing that R1’s best route to 172.16.3.0/24 starts     by going through R5.\\nTable 7-6 Comparing R1’s Three Alternatives for the Route to 172.16.3.0/24\\nRoute Location in Figure 7-11 Cumulative Cost\\nR1–R7–R8 Left 10 + 180 + 10 = 200\\nR1–R5–R6–R8 Middle 20 + 30 + 40 + 10 = 100\\nR1–R2–R3–R4–R8 Right 30 + 60 + 20 + 5 + 10 = 125\\nptg17396363188  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAs a result of the SPF algorithm’s analysis of the LSDB, R1 adds a route to subnet \\n172.16.3.0/24 to its routing table, with the next-hop router of R5.\\nIn real OSPF networks, an engineer can do the same process by knowing the OSPF cost for \\neach interface. Armed with a network diagram, the     engineer can examine all routes, add the costs, and predict the metric for each route.\\nNOTE OSPF calculates costs using different processes depending on the area design. The example surrounding Figure 7-11 best matches OSPF’s logic when using a single-area design. OSPF areas are discussed in the next few pages.\\nOSPF Area Design\\nOSPF can be used in some networks with very little thought about design issues. You just turn on OSPF in all the routers, put all interfaces into the same area (usually area 0), and it works! Figure 7-12 shows one such network example, with 11 routers      and all interfaces in area 0.\\nSW1\\nB1 B2D1\\nB3 B4SW2\\nB11 B12D2\\nB13 B14D3Area 0 (Backbone)\\nFigure 7-12 Single-Area OSPF\\nLarger OSPFv2 networks suffer with a single-area design. For instance, now imagine an enterprise network with 900 routers, rather than only 11, and several thousand subnets. As it turns out, the CPU time to run the SPF algorithm on all that topology data just takes time. As a result, OSPFv2 convergence time—the time required to react to changes in the net-work—can be slow. The routers may run low on RAM, as well. Additional     problems include the following:\\n■A larger topology database requires more memory on each router.\\n■Processing the larger topology database with    the SPF algorithm requires processing\\npower that grows exponentially with the size of the topology database.\\n■A single interface status change, anywhere in the internetwork (up to down, or down to\\nup), forces every router to run SPF again!\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  189\\nThe solution is to take the one large LSDB and break it into several smaller LSDBs by using \\nOSPF areas. With areas, each link is placed into one area. SPF does its complicated math on the topology inside the area, and that area’s topology only. For instance, an internetwork with 1000 routers and 2000 subnets, broken in 100 areas, would average 10 routers and 20 subnets per area. The SPF calculation on a router would have to only process topology about 10 routers and 20 links, rather than 1000 routers and 2000 links.\\nSo, how large does a network have to be before OSPF needs to use areas? Well, there is \\nno set answer, because the     behavior of the SPF process depends largely on CPU process-ing speed, the amount of RAM, the size of the LSDB, and so on. Generally, networks larger than a few dozen routers benefit from areas, and some documents over the years have listed 50 routers as the dividing line at which a network really should use areas.\\nThe next few pages look at how OSPF area design works, with more reasons as to why areas \\nhelp make larger OSPF networks work better.\\nOSPF Areas\\nOSPF area design follows a couple of basic rules. To apply the rules, start with a clean draw-ing of the internetwork, with routers, and     all interfaces. Then, choose the area for each router interface, as follows:\\n■Put all interfaces connected to the same subnet inside the same area.\\n■An area should be contiguous.\\n■Some routers may be internal to an area, with all interfaces assigned to that single area.\\n■Some routers may be Area Border Routers (ABR), because some interfaces connect to\\nthe backbone area, and some connect to nonbackbone areas.\\n■All nonbackbone areas must connect to the backbone area (area 0) by having at least one\\nABR connected to both the backbone area and the nonbackbone area.\\nFigure 7-13 shows one example. Some engineer started with a network diagram that showed all 11 routers and their links. On the left, the engineer put four serial links, and the LANs connected to branch routers B1 through B4, into area 1. Similarly, he placed the links to branches B11 through B14, and their LANs, in area 2. Both areas need a connection      to the backbone area, area 0, so he put the LAN interfaces of D1 and D2 into area 0, along with D3, creating the backbone area.\\nThe figure also shows a few important OSPF area design terms. Table 7-7 summarizes the \\nmeaning of these terms, plus some other     related terms, but pay closest attention to the terms from the figure.\\nptg17396363190  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nB1 B2D1\\nB3 B4 B11 B12D2\\nB13 B14D3\\nInternal RoutersBackbone\\nRouterArea Border Router (ABR)Area 0 (Backbone)\\nArea 1 Area 2Internal Routers10.1.11.0 10.1.12.0 10.1.13.0 10.1.14.0SW1 SW2\\nFigure 7-13 Three-Area OSPF with D1 and D2 as ABRs\\nTable 7-7 OSPF Design T erminology\\nTerm Description\\nArea Border Router \\n(ABR)An OSPF router       with interfaces connected to the backbone area and to at least one other area\\nBackbone router A router connected to the backbone area (includes ABRs)     \\nInternal router A router in one area (not the backbone area)     Area A set of routers and links that shares the same detailed LSDB \\ninformation, but not with routers in other areas, for better efficiency    \\nBackbone area A special OSPF area to which all other areas must connect—area 0     \\nIntra-area route A route to a subnet inside the same area as the router    Interarea route A route to a subnet in an area of which the router is not a part    \\nHow Areas Reduce SPF Calculation Time\\nFigure 7-13 shows a sample area design      and some terminology related to areas, but it does \\nnot show the power and benefit of the areas. To understand how areas reduce the work SPF has to do, you need to understand what changes about the LSDB inside an area, as a result of the area design.\\nSPF spends most of its processing time working through all the topology details, namely \\nrouters and the links that connect routers. Areas reduce SPF’s workload because, for a given area, the LSDB lists only routers and links inside that area, as shown on the left side of Figure 7-14.\\nWhile the LSDB has less topology information, it still has to have information about all \\nsubnets in all areas, so that each router can create IPv4 routes for all subnets. So, with an area design, OSPFv2 uses very brief summary information about the subnets in other areas. These LSAs do not include topology information about the other areas, so they do not require much SPF processing at all. Instead, these subnets all appear like subnets      connected to the ABR (in this case, ABR D1).\\nptg173963637Chapter 7: Understanding OSPF Concepts  191\\nB1 B2D1\\nB3 B410.1.14.0\\nDetailed Topology Data (Routers and Links):\\nRequires Heavy SPF10.1.13.010.1.12.010.1.11.0\\nSubnets in Other Areas:Requires Little SPFArea 1 LSDB\\nABR\\nFigure 7-14 Smaller Area 1 LSDB Concept\\nOSPF Area Design Advantages\\nIn summary, using a single-area OSPF design works well for smaller OSPF networks. It \\navoids the added complexity, making the network slightly easier to operate. It also requires less planning effort because no one has to plan     which parts of the network end up in which area.\\nUsing multiple areas improves OSPF operations in many ways for larger networks. The fol-\\nlowing list summarizes some of the key points arguing for the use of multiple areas in larger OSPF networks:\\n■The smaller per-area LSDB requires less memory.\\n■Routers require fewer CPU cycles to process the smaller per-area LSDB with the SPF\\nalgorithm, reducing CPU overhead and improving convergence time.\\n■Changes in the network (for example, links failing and recovering) require SPF calcula-\\ntions only on routers connected to the area where the link changed state, reducing the\\nnumber of routers that must rerun SPF.\\n■Less information must be advertised between areas, reducing the bandwidth required to\\nsend LSAs.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Use the router ospf process-id global      command to enter OSPF configuration \\nmode for a particular OSPF process.\\nStep 2. (Optional) Configure the OSPF router ID by doing the following:\\nA. Use the router-id id-value router subcommand    to define the router ID\\nB. Use the interface loopback number global     command, along with an ip \\naddress address mask command, to configure an IP address on a loop-\\nback interface (chooses the highest IP address of all working loopbacks)\\nC. Rely on an interface IP address (chooses the highest IP address of all \\nworking nonloopbacks)\\nStep 3. Use one or more network ip-address wildcard-mask area area-id router sub-\\ncommands to enable OSPFv2 on any interfaces matched by the configured \\naddress and mask, enabling OSPF on the interface for the listed area.\\nStep 4. (Optional) Use the passive-interface type number router subcommand      to con-\\nfigure any OSPF interfaces as passive if no neighbors can or should be discov-ered on the interface.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  197\\nFor a more visual perspective on OSPFv2 configuration, Figure 8-1 shows the relation-\\nship between the key OSPF configuration commands. Note that the configuration creates a routing process in one part of the configuration, and then indirectly enables OSPF on each interface. The configuration does not name the interfaces on which OSPF is enabled, instead requiring IOS to apply some logic by comparing the OSPF network command     to the interface ip address commands. The upcoming example discusses more about this logic.\\n(Indirectly) Enable OSPF Process\\non the InterfaceDefine Process IDOSPF Mode:\\nrouter ospf 1 Configuration\\nrouter-id 1.1.1.1 Set Router ID (Optional)\\nDefine Area Numbernetwork 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255   area 0\\ninterface S0/0/0\\nip address  10.1.1.1  255.255.255.0Indirect!

All links sit in area 0. The design has four routers, each connected to one or two LANs. However, note that Routers R3 and R4, at the top of the figure, connect to the same two VLANs/subnets, so they    will form neighbor relationships with each other over each of those VLANs as well. (The two switches at the top of the design are acting as Layer 2 switches.)\\nExample 8-1 shows the IPv4 addressing configuration on Router R3, before getting into the \\nOSPF detail. The configuration enables 802.1Q trunking on R3’s G0/0 interface, and assigns an IP address to each subinterface.

First, the router ospf 1 global command      puts the user in OSPF configuration mode, and sets the OSPF process-id. This number just needs to be unique on the local router, allowing     the router to support multiple OSPF processes in a single router by using different process IDs. (The router command uses the process-id to distinguish between the processes.) The process-id does not have to match on each router, and    it can be any integer between 1 and 65,535.\\nExample 8-2 OSPF Single-Area Configuration on R3 Using One network Command\\nrouter ospf 1\\n network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0\\nSpeaking generally rather than about this example, the OSPF network command tells a rout-\\ner to find its local interfaces      that match the first two parameters on the network command. \\nThen, for each matched interface, the router enables OSPF on those interfaces, discovers neighbors, creates neighbor relationships, and assigns the interface to the area listed in the network command. (Note that the area can be configured as either an integer or a dotted-decimal number, but this book makes a habit of configuring the area number as an integer. The integer area numbers range from 0 through 4,294,967,295.)\\nFor the specific command in Example 8-2, any matched interfaces are assigned to area 0. \\nHowever, the first two parameters—the ip_address and wildcard_mask parameter values of 10.0.0.0 and 0.255.255.255—need some explaining. In this case, the        command matches all three interfaces shown for Router R3; the next topic explains why.\\nMatching with the OSPF network Command\\nThe key to understanding the traditional OSPFv2 configuration      shown in this first example is to understand the OSPF network command. The OSPF network command compares the \\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  199\\nfirst parameter in the command to each interface IP address on the local router, trying to \\nfind a match. However, rather than comparing the entire number in the network command to the entire IPv4 address on the interface, the router can compare a subset of the octets, based on the     wildcard mask, as follows:\\nWildcard 0.0.0.0: Compare all 4 octets. In other words, the numbers must exactly match.\\nWildcard 0.0.0.255: Compare the first 3 octets only. Ignore the last octet when compar-\\ning the numbers.\\nWildcard 0.0.255.255: Compare the first 2 octets only. Ignore the last 2 octets when \\ncomparing the numbers.\\nWildcard 0.255.255.255: Compare the first octet only. Ignore the last 3 octets when \\ncomparing the numbers.\\nWildcard 255.255.255.255: Compare nothing—this wildcard mask means that all \\naddresses will match the network command.\\nBasically, a wildcard mask value of 0 in an octet tells IOS to compare to see if the numbers \\nmatch, and a value of 255 tells IOS to ignore that octet when comparing the numbers.\\nThe network command provides many flexible options because of the wildcard mask. For \\nexample, in Router R3, many network commands could be used, with some matching all \\ninterfaces, and some matching a subset of interfaces. Table 8-2 shows a sampling of options, with notes.\\nTable 8-2 Example OSPF network Commands on R3, with Expected Results\\nCommand Logic in Command Matched \\nInterfaces\\nnetwork 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 Match interface IP addresses that begin with 10.1 G0/0.341\\nG0/0.342\\nS0/0/0\\nnetwork 10.0.0.0 \\n0.255.255.255Match interface IP addresses that begin with 10 G0/0.341\\nG0/0.342\\nS0/0/0\\nnetwork 0.0.0.0 \\n255.255.255.255Match all interface IP addresses G0/0.341\\nG0/0.342S0/0/0\\nnetwork 10.1.13.0 0.0.0.255 Match interface IP addresses that begin with \\n10.1.13S0/0/0\\nnetwork 10.1.3.1 0.0.0.0 Match one IP address: 10.1.3.1 G0/0.341\\nThe wildcard mask gives the local router its rules for matching its own interfaces. For exam-\\nple, Example 8-2 shows R3 using the network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0 command. However, the wildcard mask allows for many different valid OSPF configurations. For instance, in that same internetwork, Routers R1 and R2 could use the configuration shown in Example 8-3, with two other wildcard masks. In both routers, OSPF is enabled          on all the interfaces shown in Figure 8-2.\\nptg17396363200  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 8-3 OSPF Configuration on Routers R1 and R2\\n!

Basically, that includes all wildcard masks that could be used to match all IP addresses in a subnet, as discussed in the “Finding the Right Wildcard Mask to Match a Subnet” section of Chapter 16, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists” (which is Chapter 25 of the ICND1 Cert Guide). For example, a mask of 0.255.255.0 would not be allowed.\\nNOTE The first two parameters of the network command are the address and the wildcard \\nmask. By convention, if the wildcard mask octet is 255, the matching address octet should be configured as a 0. Interestingly, IOS will actually accept a network command that breaks this rule, but then IOS will change that octet of the address to a 0 before putting it into the running configuration file. For example, IOS will change a typed command that begins with network 1.2.3.4 0.0.255.255 to network 1.2.0.0 0.0.255.255.\\nVerifying OSPFv2 Single Area \\nAs mentioned in Chapter 7, OSPF routers use a three-step process to eventually add OSPF-learned routes to the IP routing table. First, they create neighbor     relationships. Then they build and flood LSAs, so each router in the same area has a copy of the same LSDB. Finally, each router independently computes its own IP routes using the SPF algorithm and adds them to its routing table.\\nThe show ip ospf neighbor, show ip ospf database, and show ip route commands display \\ninformation for each of these three steps, respectively. To verify OSPF, you can use the \\nsame sequence. Or, you can just go look at the IP routing table, and if the routes look cor-rect, OSPF probably worked.\\nFor example, first, examine the list of neighbors known on Router R3 from the configura-\\ntion in Examples 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3. R3 should have one neighbor relationship with R1, over the serial link. It also has two neighbor relationships with R4, over the two different VLANs to which both routers connect. Example 8-4 shows all three.\\nExample 8-4 OSPF Neighbors on Router R3 from Figure 8-2\\nR3# show ip ospf neighbor\\nNeighbor ID     Pri   State Dead Time   Address Interface\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  201\\n1.1.1.1 0   FULL/  -   00:00:33    10.1.13.1     Serial0/0/0\\n10.1.24.4 1   FULL/DR    00:00:35    10.1.3.130    GigabitEthernet0/0.342\\n10.1.24.4 1   FULL/DR    00:00:36    10.1.3.4 GigabitEthernet0/0.341\\nThe detail in the output mentions several important facts, and for most people, working \\nright to left works best in this case. For example, looking at the headings:\\nInterface: This is the local router’s interface connected to the neighbor. For example, the \\nfirst neighbor in the list is reachable through R3’s S0/0/0 interface.\\nAddress: This is the neighbor’s IP address on that link. Again, for this first neighbor, the \\nneighbor, which is R1, uses IP address 10.1.13.1.\\nState: While many possible states exist, for the details discussed in this chapter, FULL is \\nthe correct and fully working state in this case.\\nNeighbor ID: This is the router ID of the neighbor.\\nNext, Example 8-5 shows the contents of the LSDB on Router R3. Interestingly, when \\nOSPF is working correctly in an internetwork with a single-area design, all the routers will have the same LSDB contents. So, the show ip ospf database command in Example 8-5 should list the same exact information, no matter on which of the four routers           it is issued.\\nExample 8-5 OSPF Database on Router R3 from Figure 8-2\\nR3# show ip ospf database\\nOSPF Router with ID (10.1.13.3) (Process ID 1)\\nRouter Link States (Area 0)\\nLink ID ADV Router Age Seq# Checksum Link count\\n1.1.1.1 1.1.1.1 498 0x80000006 0x002294 6\\n2.2.2.2 2.2.2.2 497 0x80000004 0x00E8C6 5\\n10.1.13.3 10.1.13.3 450 0x80000003 0x001043 4\\n10.1.24.4 10.1.24.4 451 0x80000003 0x009D7E 4\\nNet Link States (Area 0)\\nLink ID ADV Router Age Seq#       Checksum\\n10.1.3.4 10.1.24.4 451 0x80000001 0x0045F8\\n10.1.3.130 10.1.24.4 451 0x80000001 0x00546B\\nFor the purposes of this book, do not be concerned about the specifics in the output of this command. However, for perspective, note that the LSDB should list one “Router Link State” (Type 1 Router LSA) for each of the routers in the same area. In this design, all four routers are in the same area, so there are four highlighted Type 1 LSAs listed. \\nNext, Example 8-6 shows R3’s IPv4 routing table with the show ip route command. Note \\nthat it lists connected routes as well as OSPF routes. Take a moment to look back at Figure 8-2, and look for the subnets that are not locally connected to R3. Then look          for those routes in the output in Example 8-5.\\nptg17396363202  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 8-6 IPv4 Routes Added by OSPF on Router R3 from Figure 8-2\\nR3# show ip route\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\nD - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area\\nN1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2\\nE1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2\\n!

The code of “O” on the \\nleft identifies a route as being learned by OSPF. The output lists five such IP routes. From Figure 8-2, five subnets exist that are not connected subnets off Router R3. Looking for a quick count of OSPF routes, versus nonconnected routes in the diagram, gives a quick check of whether OSPF learned all routes.\\nNext, take a look at the first route (to subnet 10.1.1.0/25). It lists the subnet ID and mask, \\nidentifying the subnet. It also lists two numbers in brackets. The first, 110, is the administra-tive distance of the route. All the OSPF routes in this example     use the default of 110. The second number, 65, is the OSPF metric for this route.\\nAdditionally, the show ip protocols command        is also popular as a quick look at how any \\nrouting protocol works. This command lists a group of messages for each IPv4 routing pro-tocol running on a router. Example 8-7 shows a sample, this time taken from Router R3.\\nExample 8-7 The show ip protocols Command on R3\\nR3# show ip protocols\\n*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***\\nRouting Protocol is \"ospf 1\"\\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Router ID 10.1.13.3\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  203\\n  Number of areas in this router is 1. 1 normal 0 stub 0 nssa\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n    1.1.1.1 110 06:26:17\\n    2.2.2.2 110 06:25:30\\n    10.1.24.4 110 06:25:30\\n  Distance: (default is 110)\\nThe output shows several interesting facts. The first highlighted line repeats the parameters \\non the router ospf 1 global configuration command. The second highlighted item points out R3’s router ID, as discussed further in the next section. The third highlighted line repeats more configuration, listing the parameters of the network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0 OSPF subcommand. Finally, the last highlighted item in the example acts as a head-ing before a list of known OSPF routers, by router ID.\\nConfiguring the OSPF Router ID\\nWhile OSPF has many other optional features, most       enterprise networks that use OSPF choose to configure each router’s OSPF router ID. OSPF-speaking routers must have a router ID (RID) for proper operation. By default, routers will choose an interface IP address to use as the RID. However, many network engineers prefer to choose each router’s router ID, so command output from commands like show ip ospf neighbor lists more recognizable router IDs.\\nTo choose its RID, a Cisco router uses the following process when the router reloads and \\nbrings up the OSPF process. Note that when one of these steps identifies the RID, the pro-cess stops.\\n1. If the router-id rid OSPF subcommand is configured, this value is used as the RID.\\n2. If any loopback interfaces have an IP address configured, and the interface has an\\ninterface status of up, the router picks the highest numeric IP address among these\\nloopback interfaces.\\n3. The router picks the highest numeric IP address from all other interfaces whose inter-face status code (first status code) is up. (In other words, an interface in up/down statewill be included by OSPF when choosing its router ID.)\\nThe first and third criteria should make some sense right away: the RID is either configured \\nor is taken from a working interface’s IP address. However, this book has not yet explained the concept of a loopback interface, as mentioned in Step 2.\\nA loopback interface   is a virtual interface that can be configured with the interface loopback  \\ninterface-number command, where interface-number is an integer. Loopback interfaces are \\nalways in an “up and up” state unless administratively placed in a shutdown state. For example, \\na simple configuration of the command interface loopback 0, followed by ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.0, would create a loopback interface and assign it an IP address. Because loop-back interfaces do not rely on any hardware, these interfaces can be up/up whenever IOS is running, making them good interfaces on which to base an OSPF RID.\\nptg17396363204  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 8-8 shows the configuration that existed in Routers R1 and R2 before the creation \\nof the show command output in Examples 8-4, 8-5, and 8-6. R1 set       its router ID using the direct method, while R2 used a loopback IP address.\\nExample 8-8 OSPF Router ID Configuration Examples\\n!

So, if OSPF comes up, and later the configuration changes in a way that would impact the OSPF RID, OSPF does not change the RID immediately. Instead, IOS waits until the next time the OSPF process is restarted.\\nExample 8-9 shows the output of the show ip ospf command on R1, after the configuration \\nof Example 8-8 was made, and after the router was reloaded, which       made the OSPF router ID change.\\nExample 8-9 Confirming the Current OSPF Router ID\\nR1# show ip ospf\\n Routing Process \"ospf 1\" with ID 1.1.1.1\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nOSPF Passive Interfaces\\nOnce OSPF has been enabled on an interface, the      router tries to discover neighboring OSPF \\nrouters and form a neighbor relationship. To do so, the router sends OSPF Hello messages on a regular time interval (called the Hello Interval). The router also listens for incoming Hello messages from potential neighbors.\\nSometimes, a router does not need to form neighbor relationships with neighbors on an \\ninterface. Often, no other routers exist on a particular link, so the router has no need to keep sending those repetitive OSPF Hello messages.\\nWhen a router does not need to discover neighbors off some interface, the engineer has a \\ncouple of configuration options. First, by doing nothing, the router keeps sending the mes-sages, wasting some small bit of CPU cycles and effort. Alternately, the engineer can config-ure the interface as an OSPF passive interface, telling the router to do the following:\\n■Quit sending OSPF Hellos on the interface.\\n■Ignore received Hellos on the interface.\\n■Do not form neighbor relationships over the interface.\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  205\\nBy making an interface passive, OSPF does not form neighbor relationships over the inter-\\nface, but it does still advertise about the subnet connected to that interface. That is, the OSPF configuration enables OSPF on the interface (using the network router subcommand), and then makes the interface passive (using the passive-interface router subcommand).\\nTo configure an interface as passive, two options exist. First, you can add the following \\ncommand to the configuration    of the OSPF process, in router configuration mode:\\npassive-interface type number\\nAlternately, the configuration can change the default      setting so that all interfaces are passive by default, and then add a no passive-interface command for all interfaces that need to not be passive:\\npassive-interface default\\nno passive interface type number\\nFor example, in the sample internetwork in Figure 8-2 (used in the single-area configuration \\nexamples), Router R1, at the bottom left of the figure, has a LAN interface configured for VLAN trunking. The only router connected to both VLANs is Router R1, so R1 will never discover an OSPF neighbor on these subnets. Example 8-10 shows two alternative configu-rations to make the two LAN subinterfaces passive to OSPF.\\nExample 8-10 Configuring Passive Interfaces on R1 and R2 from Figure 8-2\\n! First, make each subinterface passive directly\\nrouter ospf 1\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\n! Or, change the default to passive, and make the other interfaces\\n! not be passive\\nrouter ospf 1\\n passive-interface default\\n no passive-interface serial0/0/0\\n no passive-interface serial0/0/1\\nIn real internetworks, the choice of configuration style reduces to which option requires \\nthe least number of commands. For example, a router with 20 interfaces, 18 of which are passive to OSPF, has far fewer configuration commands when using the   passive-interface default command to change the default to passive. If only two of those 20 interfaces need to be passive, use the default setting, in which all interfaces are not passive, to keep the con-figuration shorter.\\nInterestingly, OSPF makes it a bit of a challenge to use show commands to find whether or \\nnot an interface is passive. The show running-config command lists the configuration direct-\\nly, but if you cannot get into enable mode to use this command, note these two facts:\\nThe show ip ospf interface brief command   lists all interfaces on which OSPF is enabled, \\nincluding passive interfaces.\\nptg17396363206  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe show ip ospf interface command lists   a single line that mentions that the interface is \\npassive.\\nExample 8-11 shows these two commands on Router R1, with the configuration shown in \\nthe top of Example 8-10.

Lines omitted for brevity\\nImplementing Multiarea OSPFv2\\nConfiguring the routers in a multiarea design is almost just like configuring OSPFv2 for a \\nsingle area. The only difference is that the configuration places some interfaces on each ABR in different areas. The differences come    in the verification and operation of OSPFv2.\\nThis second major section of the chapter provides a second set of configurations to contrast \\nmultiarea configuration with single-area configuration. This new scenario shows the con-figuration for the routers in the multiarea OSPF design based on Figures 8-3 and 8-4. Figure 8-3 shows the internetwork topology and subnet IDs, and Figure 8-4 shows the area design. Note that Figure 8-3 lists the last octet of each router’s IPv4 address     near each interface, rather than the entire IPv4 address, to reduce clutter.\\nTake a moment to think about the area design shown in Figure 8-4, and look for the ABRs. \\nOnly R1 connects to the backbone area at all. The other three routers are internal routers in a single area. So, as it turns out, three of the four routers have single-area configurations, with all interfaces in the same area.\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  207\\n10.1.14.0/24R3 R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/010.1.1.0/2410.1.12.0/2410.1.23.0/24\\n10.1.4.0/2410.1.2.0/24G0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/110.1.13.0/24.2.2\\n.3\\n.3\\n.4\\n.4.1\\n.1\\n.1.1.1\\nFigure 8-3 Subnets for a Multiarea OSPF Configuration Example\\nArea 4R3R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/0Area 0Area 23\\nG0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/1\\nFigure 8-4 Area Design for an Example Multiarea OSPF Configuration\\nNote that the examples in this section use a variety of configuration options just so you can \\nsee those options. The options include different ways to set the OSPF RID, different wild-card masks on OSPF network commands, and the use of passive interfaces where no other OSPF routers should exist off an interface.\\nSingle-Area Configurations\\nExample 8-12 begins the configuration example by showing the OSPF and IP address configuration on R2. Note that R2 acts as an internal router in area 23, meaning that the configuration will refer to only one area (23). The configuration sets R2’s RID to 2.2.2.2 directly with the router-id command. And, because R2 should find neighbors on both its two interfaces, neither can reasonably be made passive, so R2’s configuration       lists no pas-sive interfaces.\\nptg17396363208  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 8-12 OSPF Configuration on R2, Placing Two Interfaces into Area 23\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.23.2 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n ip address 10.1.12.2 255.255.255.0!\\nrouter ospf 1\\n network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 23\\n router-id 2.2.2.2\\nExample 8-13 continues reviewing a few commands with the configuration for both R3 \\nand R4. R3 puts both its interfaces into area 23, per its network command, sets its RID to 3.3.3.3 by using a loopback interface, and, like R2, cannot make either of its interfaces passive. The R4 configuration is somewhat different, with both interfaces placed into area 4, setting its RID based on a nonloopback interface (G0/0, for OSPF RID 10.1.14.4), and making R4’s G0/1 interface passive, because no other OSPF routers sit on that link. (Note that the choice to use one method over another to set the OSPF RID is simply to show the variety of configuration       options.)\\nExample 8-13 OSPF Single-Area Configuration on R3 and R4\\n!

In this design (as shown in Figure 8-4), only Router R1 acts as an ABR, with interfaces      in three different areas. Example 8-14 shows R1’s OSPF configuration. Note that the configuration does not state anything about R1 being an ABR; instead, it uses multiple network commands, some placing interfaces into area 0, some into area 23, and \\nsome into area 4.\\nExample 8-14 OSPF Multiarea Configuration on Router R1\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n encapsulation dot1q 11\\n ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0.12 encapsulation dot1q 12\\n ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1 ip address 10.1.14.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/0\\n ip address 10.1.12.1 255.255.255.0!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n ip address 10.1.13.1 255.255.255.0\\n!router ospf 1\\n network 10.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0\\n network 10.1.2.1 0.0.0.0 area 0\\n network 10.1.12.1 0.0.0.0 area 23 network 10.1.13.1 0.0.0.0 area 23\\n network 10.1.14.1 0.0.0.0 area 4\\n router-id 1.1.1.1\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.11 passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\nFocus on the highlighted network commands      in the example. All five commands happen to \\nuse a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.0, so that each command requires a specific match of the listed IP address. If you compare these network commands to the various interfaces on Router R1, you can see that the configuration enables OSPF, for area 0, on subinterfaces G0/0.11 and G0/0.12, area 23 for the two serial interfaces, and area 4 for R1’s G0/1 interface.\\nNOTE Many networks make a habit of using a 0.0.0.0 wildcard mask on OSPF network \\ncommands, requiring an exact match of each interface IP address, as shown in Example 8-14. This style of configuration makes it more obvious exactly which interfaces match which network command.\\nptg17396363210  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinally, note that R1’s configuration also sets its RID directly and makes its two LAN subin-\\nterfaces passive.\\nSo, what’s the big difference between single-area and multiarea OSPF configuration? \\nPractically nothing. The only difference      is that with multiarea, the ABR’s network com-mands list different areas.\\nVerifying the Multiarea Configuration\\nThe next few pages look at how to verify a few of the new OSPF features introduced in this chapter.

Several commands mention the OSPF area. The show ip protocols command basically relists the OSPF network configuration com-\\nmands, which indirectly identify the interfaces and areas. Also, the show ip ospf interface \\nand show ip ospf interface brief commands     directly show the area configured for an inter-\\nface; Example 8-15 shows an example of the briefer version of these commands.\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  211\\nExample 8-15 Listing the OSPF-Enabled Interfaces and the Matching OSPF Areas\\nR1# show ip ospf interface brief\\nInterface    PID   Area IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C\\nGi0/0.12     1     0 10.1.2.1/24 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/0.11     1     0 10.1.1.1/24 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/1 1     4 10.1.14.1/24 1     BDR   1/1\\nSe0/0/1 1     23 10.1.13.1/24 64    P2P   1/1\\nSe0/0/0 1     23 10.1.12.1/24 64    P2P   1/1\\nIn the output, to correlate the areas, just look at the interface in the first column and the \\narea in the third column. Also, for this example, double-check this information with Figures 8-3 and 8-4 to confirm that the configuration          matches the design.\\nVerifying Which Router Is DR and BDR\\nSeveral show commands identify the DR and BDR in some way, as well. In fact, the show \\nip ospf interface brief command output, just listed       in Example 8-15, lists the local router’s state, showing that R1 is DR on two subinterfaces and BDR on its G0/1 interface.\\nExample 8-16 shows two other examples that identify the DR and BDR, but with a twist. \\nThe show ip ospf interface command      lists detailed output about OSPF settings, per inter-\\nface. Those details include the RID and interface address of the DR and BDR. At the same time, the show ip ospf neighbor command lists shorthand information about the neighbor’s DR or BDR role as well; this command does not say anything about the local router’s role. \\nExample 8-16 Discovering the DR and BDR on the R1–R4 Ethernet (from R4)\\nR4# show ip ospf interface gigabitEthernet 0/0\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Internet Address 10.1.14.4/24, Area 4, Attached via Network Statement\\n  Process ID 1, Router ID 10.1.14.4, Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1\\n  Topology-MTID    Cost    Disabled    Shutdown Topology Name\\n0 1 no no Base\\n  Transmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1\\n  Designated Router (ID) 10.1.14.4, Interface address 10.1.14.4\\n  Backup Designated router (ID) 1.1.1.1, Interface address 10.1.14.1!\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nR4# show ip ospf neighbor\\nNeighbor ID     Pri   State Dead Time   Address Interface\\n1.1.1.1 1   FULL/BDR 00:00:33    10.1.14.1 GigabitEthernet0/0\\nFirst, focus on the highlighted lines from the show ip ospf interface command output. It \\nlists the DR as RID 10.1.14.4, which is R4. It also lists the BDR as 1.1.1.1, which is R1. \\nThe end of the example shows the show ip ospf neighbor command on R4, listing R4’s \\nsingle neighbor, with Neighbor RID 1.1.1.1 (R1). The command lists R4’s concept of its neighbor state with neighbor 1.1.1.1 (R1), with the current state listed as FULL/BDR. The \\nptg17396363212  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFULL state means that R4 has fully exchanged its LSDB with R1. BDR means that the neigh-\\nbor (R1) is acting as the BDR, implying that R4 (the only other router on this link) is acting       as the DR.\\nExample 8-16 also shows the results of an DR/BDR election, with the router using the high-\\ner RID winning the election. The rules work like this:\\n■When a link comes up, if two (or more) routers on the subnet send and hear each other’s\\nHello messages, they elect a DR and BDR, with the higher OSPF RID becoming DR, and\\nthe second highest RID becoming the BDR.\\n■Once the election has completed, new routers entering the subnet do not take over the\\nDR or BDR role, even if they have better (higher) RID.\\nIn this case, Routers R1 and R4, on the same Ethernet, heard       each other’s Hellos. R1, with \\nRID 1.1.1.1, has a lower-value RID than R4’s 10.1.14.1. As a result, R4 (10.1.14.1) won the DR election.\\nVerifying Interarea OSPF Routes\\nFinally, all this OSPF theory and all the show commands         do not matter if the routers do not learn IPv4 routes. To verify the routes, Example 8-17 shows R4’s IPv4 routing table.\\nExample 8-17 Verifying OSPF Routes on Router R4\\nR4# show ip route\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\nD - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area\\nN1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2\\nE1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2\\ni - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2\\nia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route\\no - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP\\n+ - replicated route, % - next hop override\\n10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 2 masks\\nO IA     10.1.1.0/24 [110/2] via 10.1.14.1, 11:04:43, GigabitEthernet0/0O IA     10.1.2.0/24 [110/2] via 10.1.14.1, 11:04:43, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nC 10.1.4.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1\\nL 10.1.4.4/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1\\nO IA     10.1.12.0/24 [110/65] via 10.1.14.1, 11:04:43, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nO IA     10.1.13.0/24 [110/65] via 10.1.14.1, 11:04:43, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nC 10.1.14.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nL 10.1.14.4/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nO IA     10.1.23.0/24 [110/66] via 10.1.14.1, 11:04:43, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nThis example shows a couple of new codes that are particularly interesting for OSPF. As \\nusual, a single character on the left identifies the source of the route, with O meaning OSPF. In addition, IOS notes any interarea routes with an IA code         as well. (The example does not list any intra-area OSPF routes, but these routes would simply omit the IA code; earlier \\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  213\\nExample 8-6 lists some intra-area OSPF routes.) Also, note that R4 has routes to all seven \\nsubnets in the topology used in this example: two connected routes and five interarea OSPF routes.\\nAdditional OSPF Features\\nSo far this chapter has focused on the most common OSPF features using the traditional configuration using the OSPF network command. This final of three major sections dis-cusses some very popular but optional OSPFv2 configuration features, as listed here in their order of appearance:\\n■Default routes\\n■Metrics\\n■Load balancing\\n■OSPF interface configuration\\nOSPF Default Routes\\nIn some cases, routers benefit    from using a default route. The ICND1 Cert Guide showed many of the details, with the configuration of static default routes in Chapter 18, learning default routes with DHCP in Chapter 20, and advertising default routes with RIP in Chapter 19. For those exact same reasons, networks that happen to use OSPFv2 can use OSPF toadvertise default routes.\\nThe most classic case for using a routing protocol to advertise a default route has to do with \\nan enterprise’s connection to the Internet. As a strategy, the enterprise engineer uses these design goals:\\n■All routers learn specific routes for subnets inside the company; a default route is not\\nneeded when forwarding packets to these destinations.\\n■One router connects to the Internet, and it has a default route that points toward the\\nInternet.\\n■All routers should dynamically learn a default route, used for all traffic going to the\\nInternet, so that all packets destined to locations in the Internet go to the one router\\nconnected to the Internet.\\nFigure 8-6 shows the idea of how OSPF advertises the default route, with the specific OSPF \\nconfiguration. In this case, a company connects to an ISP with its Router R1. That router has a static default route (destination 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) with a next-hop address of the ISP router. Then, the use of the OSPF default-information originate command (Step 2) makes the router advertise a default route using OSPF    to the remote routers (B1 and B2).\\nNOTE The example in Figure 8-6 uses a static default route, but it could have used a default route as learned from the ISP with DHCP, as well as learning a default route with External BGP (eBGP), as discussed in Chapter 12, “Implementing External BGP.”\\nptg17396363214  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n12\\n2InternetOSPFv2 Advertises Default\\nOSPFv2 Advertises Default192.0.2.1\\nG0/3\\nG0/2G0/1G0/1\\nG0/1 ip route 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  192.0.2.1ISP1\\nB02B01\\nR1default-information originate\\ndefault-information originate\\nFigure 8-6 Using OSPF to Create and Flood a Default Route\\nFigure 8-7 shows the default routes that result from OSPF’s advertisements in Figure 8-6. \\nOn the far left, the branch routers all have OSPF-learned default routes, pointing to R1. R1 itself also needs a default route, pointing to the ISP router, so that R1 can    forward all Internet-bound traffic to the ISP.\\nInternetDefaultDefault\\nDefaultISP1\\nB02B01\\nR110.1.12.1\\n10.1.13.1G0/3 192.0.2.1G0/1\\nG0/1\\nFigure 8-7 Default Routes Resulting from the default-information originate Command\\nFinally, this feature gives the engineer control over when the router originates this default \\nroute. First, R1 needs a default route, either defined as a static default route, learned from the ISP with DHCP, or learned from the ISP with a routing protocol like eBGP. The default-information originate command   then tells R1 to advertise a default route when its own default route is working, and to advertise the default route as down when its own default route fails.\\nNOTE Interestingly, the   default-information originate always router subcommand tells \\nthe router to always advertise the default route, no matter whether the router’s default route is working or not.\\nExample 8-18 shows details of the default route on both R1 and branch router B01. Beginning with Router R1, in this case, Router R1 used DHCP to learn its IP address on its G0/3 interface from the ISP. R1 then creates a static default route with the ISP router’s IP address of 192.0.2.1 as the next-hop address, as highlighted in the output      of the show ip \\nroute static command output.\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  215\\nExample 8-18 Default Routes on Routers R1 and B01\\n!

The “Gateway of last resort,” which refers to the default route currently used by the router, points to next-hop IP address 192.0.2.1, which is the ISP rout-er’s IP address. (Refer back to Figure 8-7 for the particulars.)\\nNext look to the bottom half of the example, and router BO1’s OSPF-learned default route. \\nBO1 lists a route for 0.0.0.0/0 as well. The next-hop router in this case is 10.1.12.1, which is Router R1’s IP address on the WAN link. The code on the far left is O*E2, meaning: an OSPF-learned route, which is a default route, and is specifically    an external OSPF route. Finally, BO1’s gateway of last resort setting uses that one OSPF-learned default route, with next-hop router 10.1.12.1.\\nOSPF Metrics (Cost)\\nEarlier, the Chapter 7 section “Calculating the Best Routes with SPF” discussed how SPF calculates the metric for each route, choosing the route with the best metric for each desti-nation subnet. OSPF routers can influence     that choice by changing the OSPF interface cost on any and all interfaces.\\nCisco routers allow two different ways to change the OSPF interface cost. The one straight-\\nforward way is to set the cost directly, with an interface subcommand: ip ospf cost x. The \\nother method is to let IOS choose default costs, based on a formula, but to change the inputs to the formula. This second method requires a little more thought and care and is the focus of this next topic.\\nptg17396363216  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSetting the Cost Based on Interface Bandwidth\\nThe default OSPF cost values can actually cause a little confusion, for a couple of reasons. \\nSo, to get through some of the potential confusion, this         section begins with some examples.\\nFirst, IOS uses the following formula to choose an interface’s OSPF cost. IOS puts the inter-\\nface’s bandwidth in the denominator, and a settable OSPF value called   the reference band-width in the numerator:\\nReference_bandwidth / Interface_bandwidth\\nWith this formula, the following sequence of logic happens:\\n1. A higher interface bandwidth—that is, a faster bandwidth—results in a lower number\\nin the calculation.\\n2. A lower number in the calculation gives the interface a lower cost.\\n3. An interface with a lower cost is more likely to be used by OSPF when calculating the\\nbest routes.\\nNow for some examples. Assume a default reference bandwidth, set to 100 Mbps, which is the same as 100,000 Kbps. (The upcoming examples will use a unit of Kbps just to avoid math with fractions.) Assume defaults for interface bandwidth on serial, Ethernet, and Fast Ethernet interfaces, as shown in the output   of the show interfaces command, respectively, of 1544 Kbps, 10,000 Kbps (meaning 10 Mbps), and 100,000 Kbps (meaning 100 Mbps). Table 8-3 shows the results of how IOS calculates the OSPF cost for some interface exam-ples.\\nTable 8-3 OSPF Cost Calculation Examples with Default Bandwidth Settings\\nInterface Interface Default Bandwidth (Kbps) Formula (Kbps) OSPF Cost\\nSerial 1544 Kbps 100,000/1544 64\\nEthernet 10,000 Kbps 100,000/10,000 10\\nFast Ethernet 100,000 Kbps 100,000/100,000 1\\nExample 8-19 shows the cost settings on R1’s OSPF interfaces, all based      on default OSPF \\n(reference bandwidth) and default interface bandwidth settings.\\nExample 8-19 Confirming OSPF Interface Costs\\nR1# show ip ospf interface brief\\nInterface    PID   Area IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C\\nGi0/0.12     1     0 10.1.2.1/24 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/0.11     1     0 10.1.1.1/24 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/1 1     4 10.1.14.1/24 1     BDR   1/1\\nSe0/0/1 1     23 10.1.13.1/24 64    P2P   1/1\\nSe0/0/0 1     23 10.1.12.1/24 64    P2P   1/1\\nTo change the OSPF cost on these interfaces, the engineer simply needs to use the   \\nbandwidth speed interface subcommand to set the bandwidth on an interface. The interface \\nbandwidth does not change the Layer 1 transmission speed at all; instead, it is used for other purposes, including routing protocol metric calculations. For instance, if you add the \\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  217\\nbandwidth 10000 command to a serial interface, with a default reference bandwidth, the \\nserial interface’s OSPF cost could be calculated as 100,000 / 10,000 = 10.\\nNote that if the calculation of the default metric results in a fraction, OSPF rounds down to \\nthe nearest integer. For instance, the example shows the cost for interface S0/0/0 as 64. The calculation used the default serial interface bandwidth of 1.544 Mbps, with reference band-width 100 (Mbps), with the 100 / 1.544 calculation resulting in 64.7668394. OSPF rounds         down to 64.\\nThe Need for a Higher Reference Bandwidth\\nThis default calculation works nicely as long           as the fastest link in the network runs at 100 Mbps. The default reference bandwidth is set to 100, meaning 100 Mbps, the equivalent of 100,000 Kbps. As a result, with default settings, faster router interfaces end up with the same OSPF cost, as shown in Table 8-4, because the lowest allowed OSPF cost is 1.\\nTable 8-4 Faster Interfaces with Equal OSPF Costs\\nInterface Interface Default \\nBandwidth (Kbps)Formula (Kbps) OSPF Cost\\nFast Ethernet 100,000 Kbps 100,000/100,000 1\\nGigabit Ethernet 1,000,000 Kbps 100,000/1,000,000 1\\n10 Gigabit Ethernet 10,000,000 Kbps 100,000/10,000,000 1100 Gigabit Ethernet 100,000,000 Kbps 100,000/100,000,000 1\\nTo avoid this issue, and change the default cost calculation, you can change the reference \\nbandwidth with the auto-cost reference-bandwidth speed OSPF mode subcommand. This \\ncommand sets a value in a unit of megabits per second (Mbps). To avoid the issue shown in Table 8-4, set the reference bandwidth value to match the fastest link speed in the network. For instance, auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000 accommodates links up to 10 Gbps in speed.\\nNOTE Cisco recommends making the OSPF reference bandwidth setting the same on all OSPF routers in an enterprise network.\\nFor convenient study, the following list summarizes the rules       for how a router sets its OSPF interface costs:\\n1. Set the cost explicitly, using the ip ospf cost x interface subcommand, to a value\\nbetween 1 and 65,535, inclusive.\\n2. Change the interface bandwidth with the bandwidth speed command, with speed\\nbeing a number in kilobits per second (Kbps).\\n3. Change the reference bandwidth, using router OSPF subcommand auto-cost\\nreference-bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits per second (Mbps).\\nOSPF Load Balancing\\nWhen a router uses SPF to calculate    the metric for each of several routes to reach one sub-net, one route may have the lowest metric, so OSPF puts that route in the routing table. \\nptg17396363218  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nHowever, when the metrics tie for multiple routes to the same subnet, the router can put \\nmultiple equal-cost routes in the routing table (the default is four different routes) based on the setting of the   maximum-paths number router subcommand. For example, if an internet-\\nwork has six possible paths between some parts of the network, and the engineer wants all routes to be used, the routers can be configured with the maximum-paths 6 subcommand \\nunder router ospf.\\nThe more challenging concept relates to how the routers use those multiple routes. A router could load balance the packets on a per-packet basis. For example, if the router has three equal-cost OSPF routes for the same subnet in the routing table, the router could send the one packet over the first route, the next packet over the second route, the next packet over the third route, and then start over with the first route for the next packet. Alternatively, the load balancing could be on a per-destination IP address basis.\\nNote that the default setting of maximum-paths varies by router platform.\\nOSPFv2 Interface Configuration\\nThe newer interface-style OSPF configuration    works mostly like the old style, for almost all \\nfeatures, with one important exception. The interface configuration enables OSPF directly on the interface with the ip ospf interface subcommand, while the traditional OSPFv2 con-figuration enables OSPFv2 on an interface, but indirectly, using the network command in \\nOSPF configuration mode. The rest of the OSPF features discussed throughout this chapter are not changed by the use of OSPFv2 interface configuration.\\nBasically, instead of matching interfaces with indirect logic using network commands, you \\ndirectly enable OSPFv2 on interfaces by configuring an interface subcommand on each \\ninterface.\\nOSPFv2 Interface Configuration Example\\nTo show how OSPF interface configuration    works, this example basically repeats the example shown earlier in the book using the traditional OSPFv2 configuration with network \\ncommands. So, before looking at the OSPFv2 interface configuration, take a moment to look back at Figures 8-3 and 8-4, along with Examples 8-12, 8-13, and 8-14. Once reviewed, for easier reference, Figure 8-8 repeats Figure 8-4 for reference in the upcoming interface configuration examples.\\nTo convert from the old-style configuration in Examples 8-12, 8-13, and 8-14, simply do \\nthe following:\\nStep 1. Use the no network network-id area area-id subcommands   in OSPF configu-\\nration mode to remove the network commands.\\nStep 2. Add one ip ospf process-id area area-id command in interface configuration \\nmode under each interface on which OSPF should operate, with the correct \\nOSPF process (process-id) and the correct OSPF area number.\\nFor example, Example 8-12 had a single network command that enabled OSPF on two \\ninterfaces on Router R2, putting both in area 23. Example 8-20    shows the replacement newer style of configuration.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg173963638Chapter 8: Implementing OSPF for IPv4  219\\nArea 4R3R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/0Area 0Area 23\\nG0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/1\\nFigure 8-8 Area Design Used in the Upcoming OSPF Example\\nExample 8-20 New-Style Configuration on Router R2\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.23.2 255.255.255.0\\n ip ospf 1 area 23\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1 ip address 10.1.12.2 255.255.255.0\\n ip ospf 1 area 23\\nrouter ospf 1\\n router-id 2.2.2.2\\n!

However, you can see a few small differences in command output when using the newer OSPFv2 configuration if you look closely.\\nThe show ip protocols command   relists most of the routing protocol configuration, just in \\nslightly different format, as shown in Example 8-21. With the newer-style configuration, \\nthe output lists the phrase “Interfaces Configured Explicitly,” with the list of interfaces configured with the new ip ospf process-id area area-id commands, as highlighted in the \\nexample. With the old configuration, the output lists the contents of all the network com-\\nmands, just leaving out the “network” word itself. Note that in the next two examples, R2 has been reconfigured to use OSPF interface configuration as shown in the previous exam-ple (Example 8-20), while Router R3 still uses the older-style network commands per earlier \\nconfiguration Example 8-13.\\nptg17396363220  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 8-21 Differences in show ip protocols Output: Old- and New-Style OSPFv2\\nConfiguration\\nR2# show ip protocols\\n*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***\\nRouting Protocol is \"ospf 1\"\\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Router ID 2.2.2.2\\n  Number of areas in this router is 1. 1 normal 0 stub 0 nssa\\n  Maximum path: 4  Routing for Networks:\\n  Routing on Interfaces Configured Explicitly (Area 23):\\n    Serial0/0/1\\n    GigabitEthernet0/0  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway        Distance Last Update\\n    3.3.3.3 110 00:04:59\\n    1.1.1.1 110 00:04:43\\n  Distance: (default is 110)\\n!

This Cisco-proprietary routing protocol uses configuration commands much like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), with the primary difference being that EIGRP configuration     does not need to refer to an area.

Each \\nof those different IPv4 IGPs differs in some ways, including the underlying routing proto-col algorithms like link state and distance vector. This first section of the chapter looks at how EIGRP acts like distance vector routing protocols to some degree, while at the same time, EIGRP does not fit easily into any category at all.\\nIn particular, this first section positions EIGRP against the other common IPv4 routing pro-\\ntocols. Then this section looks at basic DV concepts as implemented with RIP. Using the simpler RIP to learn the basics helps the discussion focus on the DV concepts. This section ends then with a discussion of how EIGRP uses DV features but in a more efficient way than RIP uses them.\\nIntroduction to EIGRP\\nHistorically speaking, the first IPv4 routing protocols     used DV logic. RIP Version 1 (RIPv1) was the first popularly used IP routing protocol, with the Cisco-proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later, as shown in Figure 9-1.\\n2010 2000EIGRP\\nRIP-2\\n1990OSPFv2IGRP\\n1980RIP-1\\n1st Wave IPv4:\\nDistance Vector2nd Wave\\nIPv43rd Wave:\\nIPv6EIGRPv6\\nRIPngOSPFv3\\nFigure 9-1 Timeline for IP IGPs\\nBy the early 1990s, business and technical factors pushed the IPv4 world toward a sec-ond wave of better routing protocols. RIPv1 and IGRP had some technical limitations, even though they were great options for the technology levels of the 1980s. The world needed better routing protocols due to the widespread adoption and growth of TCP/IP in enterprise networks in the 1990s. Many enterprises migrated away from older vendor-proprietary networks to instead use networks built with routers, LANs, and TCP/IP. These businesses needed better performance from their routing protocols, including better metrics and better convergence. All these factors led to the introduction of a new wave of IPv4 interior routing     protocols: RIP Version 2 (RIPv2), OSPF, and EIGRP.\\nEven today, EIGRP and OSPF remain the two primary competitors as the IPv4 routing \\nprotocol to use in a modern enterprise IPv4 internetwork. RIPv2 has fallen away as a seri-ous competitor, in part due to its less robust hop-count metric, and     in part due to its slower (worse) convergence time. Even today, you can walk in to most corporate networks and find either EIGRP or OSPF as the routing protocol used throughout the network.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 D 2 D 3 A 4 A, B 5 B 6 C\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  227\\nSo, with so many IPv4 routing protocols, how does a network engineer choose which \\nrouting protocol to use? Well, consider two key points about EIGRP that drive engineers toward wanting to use it:\\n■EIGRP uses a robust metric based on both  link bandwidth and link delay, so routers\\nmake good choices about the best route to use (see Figure 9-2).\\n■EIGRP converges quickly, meaning that when something changes in the internetwork,EIGRP quickly finds the currently best loop-free routes to use.\\nFor example, RIP uses a basic metric of hop count, meaning the number of routers between \\nthe destination subnet and the local router. The hop count metric causes RIP to choose the least-hop route, even if those links are slow links, so RIP may  choose an arguably poor route as the best route. EIGRP’s metric calculation uses a math formula that avoids routes with slow links by giving those routes worse (higher) metrics. Figure 9-2 shows an example.\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1RIP\\nBandwidth 64\\nBandwidth \\n1544Bandwidth \\n1544S0/0/0S0/0/1Subnet 10.1.1.0EIGRP\\nBandwidth 64\\nBandwidth \\n1544A B\\nCA B\\nCBandwidth \\n1544\\nFigure 9-2 EIGRP Choosing the Longer but Better Route to Subnet 10.1.1.0\\nTraditionally, from the introduction of EIGRP in the 1990s until 2013, the one big nega-tive about EIGRP was that  Cisco kept the protocol as a Cisco-proprietary protocol. As a result, to run Cisco’s EIGRP, you had to buy Cisco routers. In an interesting change, Cisco published EIGRP as an informational RFC, meaning that now other vendors can choose to implement EIGRP as well. In the past, many companies chose to use OSPF rather than EIGRP to give themselves options for what router vendor to use for future router hardware purchases. In the future, it might be that you can buy some routers from Cisco, some from other vendors, and still run EIGRP on all routers. \\nToday, EIGRP and OSPF remain the two best options for IPv4 interior routing protocols. \\nBoth converge quickly. Both use a good metric that considers link speeds when choosing the route. EIGRP can be much simpler to implement. Many reasonable network engineers have made these comparisons over the years, with some choosing OSPFv2 and others choosing EIGRP.\\nBasic Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features\\nEIGRP does not fit cleanly into the category of DV routing protocols or LS routing proto-cols. However, it most closely matches DV protocols. The next topic explains the basics of DV routing protocols as originally implemented with RIP, to give a frame of reference of \\nptg17396363228  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nhow DV protocols work. In particular, the next examples show routes that use RIP’s simple \\nhop-count metric, which, although a poor option in real networks today, is a much simpler option for learning than EIGRP’s more complex metric.\\nThe Concept of a Distance and a Vector\\nThe term distance vector  describes      what a router knows about each route. At the end of \\nthe process, when a router learns about a route to a subnet, all the router knows is some measurement of distance (the metric) and the next-hop router and outgoing interface to use for that route (a vector, or direction).\\nFigure 9-3 shows a view of both the vector and the distance as learned with RIP. The figure \\nshows the flow of RIP messages that cause R1 to learn some      IPv4 routes, specifically three routes to reach subnet X:\\n■The four-hop route through R2\\n■The three-hop route through R5\\n■The two-hop route through R7\\nSubnet XSubnet X,\\nMetric 4\\nSubnet X,\\nMetric 2Subnet X,\\nMetric 3\\nRouting UpdateR1 R5R2 R3\\nR7R4\\nR6 R8\\nFigure 9-3 Information Learned Using DV Protocols\\nDV protocols learn two pieces of information about a possible route to reach a subnet: the distance (metric) and the vector (the next-hop router). In this case, R1 learns three routes to reach subnet X. When only one route for a single subnet exists, the router chooses that one route. However, with the three possible routes in this case, R1 picks the two-hop route through next-hop Router R7, because that route has the lowest RIP metric.\\nWhile Figure 9-3 shows how R1 learns the routes with RIP updates, Figure 9-4 gives a better \\nview into R1’s distance vector logic. R1 knows three routes, each with\\nDistance: The metric for a possible route\\nVector: The direction, based on the next-hop router for a possible route\\nNote that R1 knows no other topology information      about the internetwork. Unlike LS pro-\\ntocols, RIP’s DV logic has no idea about the overall topology, instead just knowing about next-hop routers and metrics.\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  229\\nTo R2, 4 Hops\\nTo R5, 3 HopsI See 3 Routes to X:\\n- 4 Hops to R2- 3 Hops to R5 - 2 Hops to R7\\nSubnet X\\nTo R7, 2 HopsR1R2\\nR5\\nR7\\nFigure 9-4 Graphical Representation of the DV Concept\\nFull Update Messages and Split Horizon\\nDV routing protocols have a couple of functions that require messages between neighbor-\\ning routers.\\nFirst, routers need to send routing information inside some message, so that the sending \\nrouter can advertise routing information to neighboring routers. For instance, in Figure 9-3, R1 received RIP messages to learn routes. As discussed in Chapter 7, OSPF calls those messages Link-State Updates (LSU). RIP and EIGRP both call their      messages an \\nupdate  \\nmessage.\\nIn addition, routers need to monitor whether each neighboring router is still working or \\nnot; routers do so by sending and receiving regular messages with each neighbor. By quickly realizing when a neighboring router fails, routers can more quickly converge to use any still-available routes.\\nAll routing protocols use some mechanism to monitor the state of neighboring routers. \\nOSPF uses Hello messages, on a relatively short time interval (default 10 seconds on many interfaces). EIGRP uses a Hello message and process as well. However, old basic DV proto-cols such as RIP do not use a separate Hello type of message, instead using the same update message both to advertise routing information and be aware of whether the neighboring router is still alive. In other words, the function of advertising routing information, and the function of monitoring neighbor state, is done with the same update message.\\nThese older basic DV routing protocols such as RIP send periodic full routing updates \\nbased on a relatively short time interval. \\nFull update  means   that a router advertises all its \\nroutes, using one or more RIP update messages, no matter whether the route has changed or not. \\nPeriodic  means   that the router sends the message based on a short timed period (30 \\nseconds with RIP).\\nFigure 9-5 illustrates this concept in an internetwork with two routers, three LAN subnets, \\nand one WAN subnet. The figure shows both routers’ full routing tables, plus      listing the periodic full updates sent by each router.\\nptg17396363230  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nG0/0 - 172.30.21.0 /24S0/1/0\\nS0/0G0/1 - 172.30.22.0 /24R1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.S0/0S0/0S0/0G0/0Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric1100\\nR2 IP Routing Table\\nSourceConn.Conn.Conn.RIPSubnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.G0/0G0/1S0/1/0S0/1/0Next-HopN/AN/AN/A172.30.1.1Metric0001\\nRIP Update 172.30.11.0, metric 1 RIP Update172.30.21.0, metric 1172.30.22.0, metric 1\\nRIP Update 172.30.11.0, metric 1 RIP Update172.30.21.0, metric 1172.30.22.0, metric 1\\n……R1 R2G0/0 - 172.30.11.0 /24 172.30.1.0 /24\\n30 Seconds 30 Seconds172.30.1.2\\n314 2\\nFigure 9-5 Normal Steady-State RIP Operations: Full Update with Split Horizon\\nThis figure shows a lot of information, so take the time to work through the details. For \\nexample, consider what Router R1 learns for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, which is the subnet connected to R2’s G0/1 interface:\\n1. R2 interface G0/1 has an IP address, and is in an up/up state.\\n2. R2 adds a connected route for 172.30.22.0/24, off interface G0/1, to R2’s routing\\ntable.\\n3. R2 advertises its route for 172.30.22.0/24 to R1, with metric 1, meaning that R1’s\\nmetric to reach this subnet will be metric 1 (hop count 1).\\n4. R1 adds a route for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, listing it as a RIP learned route with metric 1.\\nAlso, take a moment to focus more on the route learned at Step 4: the bold route in R1’s routing table. This route is for 172.30.22.0/24, as learned from R2. It lists R1’s local S0/0 interface as the outgoing interface, because R1 receives the update on that interface. It also lists R2’s serial IP address of 172.30.1.2 as next-hop router because that’s the IP address from which R1 learned the route.\\nNext, look at the bottom of the figure, which shows the RIP update message being used \\nto monitor neighbor state. The routers repeat the exact same update message based on 30-second timers. Note that in this internetwork, if nothing changed for a year, with RIP, every 30 seconds, the routers would repeat this same routing information to each other. Why? If a router fails to receive the update messages for a defined time period, the local router      knows the silent neighbor has failed.\\nFinally, the figure shows an example of \\nsplit horizon . Note     that both routers list all four \\nsubnets in their IP routing tables, yet the RIP update messages do not list four subnets. The \\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  231\\nreason? Split horizon. Split horizon is a DV feature that tells the routing protocol to not \\nadvertise some routes in an update sent out an interface. Which routes? The routes that list that same interface as the outgoing interface. Those routes that are not advertised on an interface usually include the routes learned in routing updates received on that interface.\\nSplit horizon is difficult to learn by reading words, and much easier to learn by seeing an \\nexample. Figure 9-6 continues the same example as 9-5, but focusing on R1’s RIP update sent out R1’s S0/0 interface to R2. This figure shows R1’s routing table with three light-colored routes, all of which list S0/0 as the outgoing interface. When building the RIP update to send out S0/0, split-horizon rules tell R1 to ignore those light-colored routes, because all three routes list S0/0 as the outgoing interface. Only the bold route, which does not list S0/0 as an     outgoing interface, can be included in the RIP update sent out S0/0.\\nG0/0 - 172.30.21.0 /24S0/1/0\\nS0/0G0/1 - 172.30.22.0 /24R1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.S0/0S0/0S0/0G0/0Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric1100\\nRIP UpdateOnly Bold Route Has Interface\\nOther Than S0/0\\n172.30.11.0, metric 1\\nR1 R2G0/0 - 172.30.11.0 /24 172.30.1.0 /24\\n172.30.1.2\\nFigure 9-6 R1 Does Not Advertise Three Routes Due to Split Horizon\\nRoute Poisoning\\nDV protocols help prevent     routing loops by ensuring that every router learns that the route \\nhas failed, through every means possible, as quickly as possible. One of these features, \\nroute poisoning , helps all routers know for sure that a route has failed.\\nRoute poisoning refers to the practice of advertising a failed route, but with a special metric value called   \\ninfinity . Routers consider routes advertised with an infinite metric to have \\nfailed. Figure 9-7 shows an example of route poisoning with RIP, with R2’s G0/1 interface failing, meaning that R2’s route for 172.30.22.0/24 has failed. RIP defines infinity as 16.\\nFigure 9-7 shows the following process:\\n1. R2’s G0/1 interface fails.\\n2. R2 removes its connected route for 172.30.22.0/24 from its routing table.\\n3. R2 advertises 172.30.22.0 with an infinite metric (which for RIP is 16).\\n4. Depending on other conditions, R1 either immediately removes the route to\\n172.30.22.0 from its routing table, or marks the route as unusable (with an infinite\\nmetric) for a few minutes before removing the route.\\nBy the end of this process, Router R1 knows for sure that its old route for subnet \\n172.30.22.0/24 has failed, which helps R1 not introduce any looping IP routes.\\nptg17396363232  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nG0/0 - 172.30.21.2/24S0/1/0S0/0R1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.S0/0S0/0S0/0G0/0Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric11600\\nR2 IP Routing Table\\nSourceConn.Conn.Conn.RIPSubnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.G0/0G0/1S0/1/0S0/1/0Next-HopN/AN/AN/A172.30.1.1Metric0001\\nR1 R2G0/0\\n172.30.11.1 172.30.1.1172.30.1.2\\n172.30.21.0, metric 1\\n172.30.22.0, metric 164 2\\n1\\n3G0/1  - 172.30.22.2/24\\nFigure 9-7 Route Poisoning\\nEach routing protocol has its own definition of an infinite metric.

EIGRP has long used 232 – 1 as \\ninfinity (a little over 4 billion) with an option for a wider (larger) metric beyond     the scope of this chapter. OSPFv2 uses 2\\n24 – 1 as infinity.\\nEIGRP as an Advanced DV Protocol\\nEIGRP acts a little like a DV protocol, and     a little like no other routing protocol. Frankly, over the years, different Cisco documents and different books (mine included) have char-acterized EIGRP either as its own category, called a balanced hybrid routing protocol, or as some kind of advanced DV protocol.\\nRegardless of what label you put on EIGRP, the protocol uses several features that work \\nlike some other Distance Vector protocols like RIP. The next few pages walk through a few of the similarities and differences between RIP and EIGRP.\\nEIGRP Sends Partial Update Messages, As Needed\\nEIGRP does not use      a short periodic update timer, sending a full update with all routes, like RIP does. EIGRP instead sends information about each route once, when the router learns the information. Then, the router sends only partial updates.\\nEIGRP \\npartial updates  are EIGRP update messages that list any new or changed informa-\\ntion about a route. For instance, when a router interface fails, some routes will be affected. \\nThe router sends an immediate partial update message to any other neighboring EIGRP routers, listing new information. Or, when new routes become available, the router sends a partial update, about only the new routes. These update messages are not full updates, because they only contain changed or new information.\\nThe idea works a little like OSPF’s convention of flooding a link-state advertisement (LSA) \\nonce inside an area. However, the router that creates an OSPF LSA does reflood that LSA every 30 minutes. EIGRP does not even bother to reflood its routing information. For instance, if the routing information about an EIGRP route does not change for a year, EIGRP will literally remain silent about that route in its update messages for that whole year after it first advertises the route.\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  233\\nEIGRP Maintains Neighbor Status Using Hello\\nEIGRP does not send full or partial update messages       based on a short periodic timer, so \\nEIGRP cannot rely on update messages to monitor the state of EIGRP neighbors. So, using the same basic ideas as OSPF, EIGRP defines a Hello message. The EIGRP Hello message and pro-tocol defines that each router should send a periodic Hello message on each interface, so that all EIGRP routers know that the router is still working. Figure 9-8 shows the idea.\\nHello\\nIntervalHello\\nHelloHello\\nIntervalHello\\nHelloB A\\nFigure 9-8 EIGRP Hello Packets\\nNormally, EIGRP neighbors use the same    Hello Interval , which is the time period between \\neach EIGRP Hello. Routers also must receive a Hello from a neighbor within a time called \\nthe Hold Interval , with a default setting of three times the     Hello Interval.\\nFor instance, imagine both R1 and R2 use default settings of 5 and 15 for their Hello and Hold Intervals. Under normal conditions, R1 receives Hellos from R2 every 5 seconds, well within R1’s Hold Interval (15 seconds) before R1 would consider R2 to have failed. If R2 does fail, R2 no longer sends Hello messages. R1 notices that 15 seconds pass without receiving a Hello from R2, so then R1 can choose new routes that do not use R2 as a next-hop router.\\nInterestingly, EIGRP does not require two neighboring routers to use the same Hello and \\nHold intervals, but it makes good sense to use the same Hello and Hold intervals on all rout-ers. Unfortunately, the flexibility to use different settings on neighboring routers makes it possible to prevent the neighbors from working properly, just by the poor choice of Hello and Hold intervals. For instance, if R2 changes its Hello/Hold Intervals to 30/60, respective-ly, but R1 keeps its Hello/Hold Intervals of 5/15 seconds, R1 will believe R2 has failed on a regular basis. R2 sends Hello messages only every 30 seconds, but R1 expects to receive them within its 15-second Hold Interval.\\nSummary of Interior Routing Protocol Features\\nTable 9-2 summarizes the features discussed in this chapter, for RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPFv2. Following the table, the second major section of this chapter begins, which moves             into depth about the specifics of how EIGRP works.\\nTable 9-2 Interior IP Routing Protocols Compared\\nFeature RIPv2 EIGRP OSPFv2\\nMetric is based on Hop count Bandwidth and delay Cost\\nSends periodic full updates Y es No No\\nSends periodic Hello messages No Y es Y es\\nptg17396363234  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFeature RIPv2 EIGRP OSPFv2\\nUses route poisoning for failed routes Y es Y es Y es\\nUses split horizon to limit updates \\nabout working routesYe s Ye s No\\nAddress to which messages are sent 224.0.0.9 224.0.0.10 224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6\\nMetric considered to be infinite 16 232 – 1 224 – 1\\nEIGRP Concepts and Operation\\nEIGRP differs from OSPF in some pretty obvious ways, but in some ways EIGRP acts a lot \\nlike OSPF. In fact, EIGRP uses a three-step model similar to OSPF when a router first joins a network. These steps each lead to a list or table: the neighbor table, the topology table, and the routing table. All these processes and tables lead toward building the IPv4 routes in the routing table, as follows:\\n1. Neighbor discovery: EIGRP    routers send Hello messages to discover potential neigh-\\nboring EIGRP routers and perform basic parameter checks to determine which routersshould become neighbors. Neighbors that pass all parameter checks are added to theEIGRP neighbor table.\\n2. Topology exchange: Neighbors  exchange full topology updates when the neighborrelationship comes up, and then only partial updates as needed based on changesto the network topology. The data learned in these updates is added to the router’sEIGRP topology table.\\n3. Choosing routes: Each router analyzes   its respective EIGRP topology tables, choosingthe lowest-metric route to reach each subnet. EIGRP places the route with the bestmetric for each destination into the IPv4 routing table.\\nThis second major section of this chapter discusses the particulars of how EIGRP goes about \\nbuilding its routing table, using these three steps. Although the overall three-step process looks similar to OSPF, the details differ greatly, especially those related to how OSPF uses LS logic to process topology data, whereas EIGRP does not. Also, in addition to these three steps, this section explains some unique logic EIGRP uses when converging and reacting to changes in an internetwork—logic that is not seen with the other types of routing protocols.\\nEIGRP Neighbors\\nFrom the perspective of one router, an EIGRP neighbor   is another EIGRP-speaking router, connected to a common subnet, with which the first router is willing to exchange EIGRP topology information. EIGRP uses EIGRP Hello messages to dynamically discover potential neighbors, sending those updates to multicast address 224.0.0.10.\\nOnce another EIGRP router is discovered using Hello messages, routers must perform some \\nbasic checking of each potential neighbor before that router becomes an EIGRP neighbor. (A potential neighbor is a router from which an EIGRP Hello has been received.) Then the router checks the following settings to determine whether the router should be allowed to be a neighbor:\\n■It must pass the authentication process if used.\\n■It must use the same configured autonomous system number (which is a configuration\\nsetting).\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  235\\n■The source IP address used by the neighbor’s Hello must be in the same subnet as the\\nlocal router’s interface IP address/mask.\\n■The routers\\' EIGRP K-values must match. (However, Cisco recommends to not change\\nthese values.)\\nEIGRP uses relatively straightforward verification checks for neighbors. First, if authentica-\\ntion is configured, the two routers     must be using the same type of authentication and the same authentication key (password). Second, EIGRP configuration includes a parameter called  an \\nautonomous system number  (ASN), which must be the same on two neighbor-\\ning routers. Finally, the IP addresses used to send the EIGRP Hello messages—the routers’ respective interface IP addresses—must be in the range of addresses on the other routers’ respective connected subnet.\\nOnce two EIGRP routers become neighbors, the routers use the neighbor relationship in \\nmuch simpler ways as compared to OSPF. Whereas OSPF neighbors have several interim states and a few stable states, EIGRP simply moves to a working state as soon as the neigh-bor passes the basic verification checks. At that point, the two routers can begin   exchanging topology information using EIGRP update messages.\\nExchanging EIGRP Topology Information\\nEIGRP uses EIGRP update messages  to send     topology information to neighbors. These \\nupdate messages can be sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.10 if the sending router needs to update multiple routers on the same subnet; otherwise, the updates are sent to the uni-cast IP address of the particular neighbor. (Hello messages are always sent to the 224.0.0.10 multicast address.) The use of multicast packets on LANs allows EIGRP to exchange routing information with all neighbors on the LAN efficiently.\\nEIGRP sends update messages without UDP or TCP, but it does use a protocol called    \\nReliable Transport Protocol  (RTP). RTP provides a mechanism to resend any EIGRP \\nmessages that are not received by a neighbor. By using RTP, EIGRP can better avoid loops \\nbecause a router knows for sure that the neighboring router has received any updated rout-ing information. (The use of RTP is just another example of a difference between basic DV protocols like RIP, which have no mechanism to know whether neighbors receive update messages, and the more advanced EIGRP.)\\nNOTE The acronym RTP also refers to a different protocol,   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), which is used to transmit voice and video IP packets.\\nEIGRP neighbors use both full routing updates and partial updates. A full update   means that a router sends information about all known routes, whereas a partial update includes only information about recently changed routes. Full updates occur when neighbors first come up. After that, the neighbors send only partial updates in reaction to changes to a route.\\nFigure 9-9 summarizes many of the details discussed so far in this section, from top to bot-\\ntom. It first shows neighbor discovery with Hellos, the sending of full updates, the mainte-nance of the neighbor relationship with ongoing Hellos, and partial     updates.\\nptg17396363236  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nB A\\nNeighbor Discovery (Hello)\\nFull Routing Update\\nContinuous Hellos\\nPartial Updates (Status Changes\\nand New Subnet Info)Neighbor Discovery (Hello)\\nFull Routing Update\\nContinuous Hellos\\nPartial Updates (Status Changes\\nand New Subnet Info)Reliable\\nUpdate\\nFigure 9-9 Full and Partial EIGRP Updates\\nNote that EIGRP refers to the information exchanged in the updates as topology informa-\\ntion. The information is not nearly as detailed as OSPF LS topology data, and it does not attempt to describe every router and link in the network. However, it does describe more than just a distance (metric) and vector (next-hop router) for the local router—a local router also learns the metric as used by the next-hop router. This added     information is used to help EIGRP converge quickly, without causing loops, as discussed in the upcoming section “EIGRP Convergence.”\\nCalculating the Best Routes for the Routing Table\\nEIGRP calculates the metric for routes much differently than any other routing protocol. For instance, with OSPF, anyone with a network diagram and knowledge of the configured OSPF interface costs can calculate the exact OSPF metric (cost) for each route. EIGRP uses a math equation and a composite metric, making the   exact metric value hard to predict.\\nThe EIGRP Metric Calculation\\nThe EIGRP composite metric means that EIGRP feeds   multiple inputs (called metric com-ponents) into the math equation. By default, EIGRP feeds two metric components into the calculation: bandwidth and delay. The result of the calculation is an integer value and is the composite metric for that router.\\nNote that EIGRP includes other options for how it could calculate the metric, but those \\noptions are not normally used. EIGRP supports also using the interface load and interface reliability in the metric calculation. EIGRP also advertises the   maximum transmission unit (MTU) associated with the route—that is, the longest IP packet allowed over the route—but does not support using the MTU when calculating the metric. For this book’s purposes, EIGRP uses the default settings, calculating the composite metric based on the bandwidth and delay.\\nEIGRP’s metric calculation formula actually helps describe some of the key points about \\nthe composite metric. (In real life, you seldom if ever need to sit down and calculate what a router will calculate with this formula.) The formula, assuming that the default settings that tell the router to use just bandwidth and delay, is as follows:\\nMetric =    107\\nleast-bandwidth(( ( (+ cumulative-delay 256\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  237\\nIn this formula, the term least-bandwidth  represents   the lowest-bandwidth link in the \\nroute, using a unit of kilobits per second. For instance, if the slowest link in a route is a \\n10-Mbps Ethernet link, the first part of the formula is 107 / 104, which equals 1000. You \\nuse 104 in the formula because 10 Mbps is equal to 10,000 Kbps (104 Kbps).\\nThe cumulative-delay value used in the formula is the sum of all the delay values for all out-going interfaces in the route, with a unit of “tens of microseconds.”\\nUsing these two inputs helps EIGRP pick the best route with a little more balance than does \\nOSPF. Using the least bandwidth lets EIGRP avoid routes with the slowest individual links, which are usually the links with the most congestion. At the same time, the delay part of the equation adds the delay for every link, so that routes with a large number of links will be relatively less desirable than a route with fewer links.\\nYou can set both bandwidth and delay for each link, using         the cleverly named \\nbandwidth  \\nand delay  interface subcommands.\\nNOTE Most show  commands, including show ip eigrp  topology  and show interfaces , \\nlist delay settings as the number of microseconds of delay. Note that the EIGRP metric for-\\nmula uses a unit of tens of microseconds.\\nAn Example of Calculated EIGRP Metrics\\nNow that you have an idea of how the router’s EIGRP math   works, next consider an exam-ple that connects what a router learns in an EIGRP update message, local configuration set-tings, and the calculation of the metric for a single route.\\nTo calculate the metric, a local router must consider the information received from the \\nneighboring router as well as its local interface settings. First, EIGRP update messages list the subnet number and mask, along with all the metric components: the cumulative delay, minimum bandwidth, along with the other usually unused metric components. The local router then considers the bandwidth and delay settings on the interface on which the update was received, and calculates a new metric.\\nFor example, Figure 9-10 shows Router R1 learning about subnet 10.1.3.0/24 from Router \\nR2. The EIGRP update message from R2 lists a minimum bandwidth of 100,000 Kbps, and a cumulative delay of 100 microseconds. R1’s S0/1 interface has an interface bandwidth set to 1544 Kbps—the default bandwidth on a serial link—and a delay of 20,000 microseconds.\\n10.1.3.0/24\\nMinimum Bandwidth = 100,000Cumulative Delay = 100\\nEIGRP UpdateFA0/0 S0/1\\nBandwidth: 1544\\nDelay: 20,000Fa0/1Subnet 10.1.3.0/24\\nBandwidth: 100,000Delay: 100\\nR2 R1\\nFigure 9-10 How R1 Calculates Its EIGRP Metric for 10.1.3.0/24\\nptg17396363238  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNext, consider how R1 thinks about the least-bandwidth part of the calculation. R1 discov-\\ners that its S0/1 interface bandwidth (1544 Kbps, or 1.544 Mbps) is less than the advertised minimum bandwidth of 100,000 Kbps, or 100 Mbps. R1 needs to use this new, slower bandwidth in the metric calculation. (If R1’s S0/1 interface had a bandwidth of 100,000 Kbps or more in this case, R1 would instead use the minimum bandwidth listed in the EIGRP update from R2.)\\nAs for interface delay, the router always adds its interface delay to the delay listed in the \\nEIGRP update. However, the unit for delay can be a bit of a challenge. The units, and their use, are as follows:\\nUnit of microseconds: Listed in the output of \\nshow  commands such as show interfaces  \\nand show ip eigrp topology , and in the EIGRP update messages\\nUnit of tens-of-microseconds: Used by the interface mode configuration command \\n(delay), with which to set the delay, and in the EIGRP metric calculation\\nBecause of this weird difference in units, when looking at the delay, make sure you keep \\nthe units straight. In this particular example:\\n■R1 received an update that lists delay of 100 (microseconds), which R1 converts to the\\nequivalent 10 tens of microseconds before using it in the formula.\\n■R1 sees its S0/1 interface setting of 20,000 microseconds, which equals 2000 tens of\\nmicroseconds\\n■For the purposes of the calculation, R1 adds 10 tens of microseconds from the update\\nmessage to 2000 tens of microseconds for the interface for a total delay of 2010 tens of\\nmicroseconds.\\nThis example results in the following   metric calculation:\\n107\\n1544+ (10 + 2000) Metric =    ((( (256 = 2,172,416\\nNOTE For those of you who repeat this math at home, IOS rounds down the division in \\nthis formula to the nearest integer before performing the rest of the formula. In this case, 10\\n7 / 1544 is rounded down to 6476, before adding the 2010 and then multiplying by 256.\\nIf multiple possible routes to subnet 10.1.3.0/24 exist, Router R1 also calculates the metric for those routes and chooses the route with the best (lowest) metric   to be added to the routing table.\\nNOTE The examples in this chapter show routers with Gigabit interfaces, which default their delay settings to 10 microseconds. However, IOS adjusts the delay based on the actual speed of a LAN interface. In the examples in this chapter and the next, all the LAN inter-faces happen to be running at 100 Mbps, making the delay be 100 microseconds.\\nCaveats with Bandwidth on Serial Links\\nEIGRP’s robust metric      gives it the ability to choose routes that include more router hops but with faster links. However, to ensure that the right routes are chosen, engineers must \\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  239\\ntake care to configure meaningful bandwidth and delay settings. In particular, serial links \\ndefault to a bandwidth of 1544 and a delay of 20,000 microseconds, as used in the example shown in Figure 9-10. However, IOS cannot automatically change the bandwidth and delay settings based on the Layer 1 speed of a serial link. So, using default bandwidth and delay settings, particularly the bandwidth setting on serial links, can lead to problems.\\nFigure 9-11 shows the problem with using default bandwidth settings and how EIGRP uses \\nthe better (faster) route when the bandwidth is set correctly. The figure focuses on router B’s route to subnet 10.1.1.0/24 in each case. In the left side of the figure, all serial interfaces use defaults, even though the top serial link actually runs at a slow 64 Kbps. The right side of the figure shows the results when the slow serial link’s \\nbandwidth  command is changed \\nto reflect the correct (slow) speed.\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1\\nBandwidth 1544\\nBandwidth \\n1544Bandwidth \\n1544S0/0/0S0/0/1Subnet 10.1.1.0\\nBandwidth 64\\nBandwidth \\n1544A B\\nCA B\\nCBandwidth \\n1544EIGRP , Default Bandwidth EIGRP , Correct Bandwidth\\nBest Route\\nBest Route\\nFigure 9-11 Impact of the Bandwidth on EIGRP’s Metric Calculation\\nGenerally, a good metric strategy for networks that use EIGRP is to set the WAN band-width to match the actual Layer 1 speed, use defaults      for LAN interfaces, and EIGRP will usually choose the best routes.\\nEIGRP Convergence\\nNow that you have seen the details   of how EIGRP forms neighbor relationships, exchanges routing information, and calculates the best route, the rest of this section looks at the most interesting part of EIGRP: EIGRP’s work to converge to a new loop-free route.\\nLoop avoidance poses one of the most difficult problems with any dynamic routing pro-\\ntocol. DV protocols overcome this problem with a variety of tools, some of which cre-ate a large portion of the minutes-long convergence time after a link failure. LS protocols overcome this problem by having each router keep a full topology of the network, so by running a rather involved mathematical model (for example, OSPF’s SPF algorithm), a router can avoid any loops.\\nEIGRP avoids loops by keeping some basic topological information, while keeping much \\nless information as compared to LS protocols like OSPF. EIGRP keeps a record of each possible next-hop router for alternate routes, and some metric details related to those routes, but no information about the topology beyond the next-hop routers. This sparser topology information does not require the sophisticated Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, but   it does allow quick convergence to loop-free routes.\\nptg17396363240  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFeasible Distance and Reported Distance\\nFirst, before getting into how EIGRP converges, you need to know a few additional EIGRP \\nterms. With EIGRP, a local router needs to consider its own calculated metric for each route, but at the same time, the local router considers the next-hop router’s calculated met-ric for that same destination subnet. And EIGRP has special terms for those metrics, as fol-lows:\\n■Feasible distance (FD): The     local router’s composite metric of the best route to reach a\\nsubnet, as calculated on the local router\\n■Reported distance (RD): The     next-hop router’s best composite metric for that same subnet\\nAs usual, the definition makes more sense with an example. Using the same advertisement \\nas earlier in Figure 9-10, Figure 9-12 shows the two calculations done by R1. One calcula-tion finds R1’s own metric (FD) for its one route for subnet 10.1.3.0/24, as discussed around Figure 9-10. The other uses the metric components in the update received from R2, to cal-culate what R2 would have calculated for R2’s metric to reach this same subnet. R1’s second calculation based on R2’s information—a slowest bandwidth of 100,000 Kbps         and a cumu-lative delay of 100 microseconds—is R1’s RD for this route.\\nR1\\n10.1.3.0/24\\nMinimum Bandwidth = 100,000Cumulative Delay = 100\\nEIGRP UpdateG0/0 S0/1\\nBandwidth: 1544 Kbps\\nDelay: 20,000 msG0/1Subnet 10.1.3.0/24\\nBandwidth: 100000 Kbps Delay: 100 ms\\nR2My FD: UseBW = 100,000Delay = 105\\x15·V\\x035\\'\\x1d\\x038VHBW = 100,000Delay = 10My FD: UseBW = 1544Delay = 20102,172,416 28,160 28,160\\n4 3 1\\n2\\nFigure 9-12 How R1 Calculates RD and FD for 10.1.3.0/24\\nFollowing the steps in the figure:\\n1. R2 calculates its own metric (its FD) for R2’s route for 10.1.3.0/24, based on a band-\\nwidth of 100,000 Kbps and a delay of 100 microseconds.\\n2. R2 sends the EIGRP update that lists 10.1.3.0/24, with these same metric components.\\n3. R1 calculates the RD for this route, using the same math R2 used at Step 1, using the\\ninformation in the update message from Step 2.\\n4. R1 calculates its own metric, from R1’s perspective, by considering the bandwidth anddelay of R1’s S0/1 interface, as discussed earlier around Figure 9-10.\\nIn fact, based on the information in Figure 9-12, R2’s FD to reach subnet 10.1.3.0/24, which \\nis also R1’s RD to reach 10.1.3.0/24, could be easily calculated:\\n107\\n100,000+ (10) (( ( (256 = 28,160\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  241\\nAt this point, R1 knows its own calculated metric for the route, called the FD, and R1 knows \\nnext-hop Router R2’s metric for R2’s route to that same         subnet. R1 calls that R2’s RD. \\nNow that you have a general idea about the FD and RD concept, consider the EIGRP con-\\nvergence process. EIGRP convergence has two branches in its logic, based on whether the failed route does or does not have a \\nfeasible successor  route. The decision of whether a \\nrouter has a feasible successor route   depends on the FD and RD values of the competing routes to reach a given subnet. The next topic defines this concept of a feasible successor route and discusses what happens in that case.\\nEIGRP Successors and Feasible Successors\\nEIGRP calculates the metric for each route to reach each subnet. For a particular subnet, the route with the best metric is called the      \\nsuccessor , with the router filling the IP routing \\ntable with this successor route. (This successor route’s metric is called the feasible distance, as introduced earlier.)\\nOf the other routes to reach that same subnet—routes whose metrics were larger than the \\nFD for the successor route—EIGRP needs to determine which alternate route can be used immediately if the currently best route fails, without causing a routing loop. EIGRP runs a simple algorithm to identify which routes could be used, keeping these loop-free backup routes in its topology table and using them if the currently best route fails. These alterna-tive, immediately usable routes are called \\nfeasible successor  routes because they can feasi-\\nbly be used as the new successor route when the previous successor route fails.\\nA router determines whether a route is a feasible successor based on the feasibility condition:\\nIf a nonsuccessor route’s RD is less than the FD, the route is a feasible successor route.\\nAlthough it is technically correct, this definition is much more understandable with an \\nexample. Figure 9-13 begins an example in which router E chooses its best route to subnet 1. Router E learns three routes to subnet 1, with next-hop routers B, C, and D. The figureshows the metrics as calculated on router E, as listed in router E’s EIGRP topology table. Router E finds that the route through router D has the lowest metric, making that router E’s successor route for subnet 1. Router E adds that route to its routing table, as shown. The FD is the metric calculated for this route, a value of 14,000 in this case.\\nSubnet 1Router E Topology Table:\\nRouter B 19,000\\nRouter C 17,500\\nRouter D 14,000\\nRouter E Routing Table\\nSubnet 1 Metric 14,000 , Through DSuccessorB\\nC E A\\nDMetric: Next Hop for Subnet 1:\\nFD = 14,000\\nFigure 9-13 Route Through Router D Is the Successor Route to Subnet 1\\nptg17396363242  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAt the same time, EIGRP on router E decides whether either of the other two routes to \\nsubnet 1 can be used immediately if the route through router D fails for whatever reason. Only a feasible successor route can be used. To meet the feasibility      condition, the alternate route’s RD must be less than the FD of the successor route. \\nFigure 9-14 demonstrates that one of the two other routes meets the   feasibility condition \\nand is therefore a feasible successor route. The figure shows an updated version of Figure 9-13. Router E uses the following logic to determine that the route through router B is not a feasible successor route, but the route through router C is, as follows:\\n■Router E compares the FD of 14,000 to the RD of the route through router B (15,000).\\nRouter B’s RD is worse than router E’s FD, so this route is not a feasible successor.\\n■Router E compares the FD of 14,000 to the RD of the route through router C (13,000).\\nRouter C’s RD is better than router E’s FD, making this route a feasible successor.\\nSubnet 1\\nRouter E Routing Table\\nSubnet 1 Metric 14,000 , Through DFeas.

Convergence occurs almost instantly in this case.\\nThe Query and Reply Process\\nWhen a route fails, and the route      has no feasible successor, EIGRP uses a distributed algo-rithm called \\nDiffusing Update Algorithm  (DUAL) to choose a replacement route. DUAL \\nsends queries looking for a loop-free route to the subnet in question. When the new route is found, DUAL adds it to the routing table.\\nThe EIGRP DUAL process simply uses messages to confirm that a route exists, and would \\nnot create a loop, before deciding to replace a failed route with an alternative route. For instance, in Figure 9-14, imagine that both routers C and D fail. Router E does not have any remaining feasible successor route for subnet 1, but there is an obvious physically available path through router B. To use the route, router E sends EIGRP \\nquery  messages     to its work-\\ning neighbors (in this case, router B). Router B’s route to subnet 1 is still working fine, so router B replies to router E with an EIGRP \\nreply  message, simply stating the details of the \\nworking route to subnet 1 and confirming that it is still viable. Router E can then add a new route to subnet 1 to its routing table, without fear of a loop.\\nptg173963639Chapter 9: Understanding EIGRP Concepts  243\\nReplacing a failed route with a feasible successor takes a very short amount of time, usu-\\nally less than a second or two. When queries and replies are required, convergence can take slightly longer, but in most networks, convergence can still     occur in less than 10 seconds.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

As is usual with this book’s imple-mentation chapters, this section begins with configuration topics, followed by verification.\\nEIGRP Configuration\\nEIGRP configuration   closely resembles OSPF configuration. The router eigrp  command \\n   enables EIGRP and puts the user in EIGRP configuration mode, in which one or more \\nnetwork  commands are configured. For each interface matched by a network  command, \\nEIGRP tries to discover neighbors on that interface, and EIGRP advertises the subnet con-nected to the interface.\\nThe following configuration checklist outlines the main    configuration tasks covered in this \\nchapter:\\nStep 1. Use the router eigrp as-number global command   to enter EIGRP configura-\\ntion mode and define the EIGRP autonomous system number (ASN).\\nStep 2. Configure one or more network ip-address [wildcard-mask] router subcom-\\nmands. This enables EIGRP on any matched   interface and causes EIGRP to \\nadvertise the connected subnet.\\nStep 3. (Optional) Use the eigrp router-id value router subcommand   to set the EIGRP \\nrouter ID (RID) explicitly.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  247\\nStep 4. (Optional) Use the ip hello-interval eigrp asn time and     ip hold-time eigrp asn\\ntime interface subcommands to change the interface Hello and hold timers.\\nStep 5. (Optional) Use the bandwidth value and delay value interface     subcommands \\nto impact metric calculations by tuning bandwidth and delay.\\nStep 6. (Optional) Use the maximum-paths number and variance multiplier router \\n    subcommands to configure support for multiple equal-cost routes.\\nStep 7. (Optional) Use the auto-summary router subcommand   to enable automatic \\nsummarization of routes at the boundaries of classful IPv4 networks.\\nExample 10-1 begins the configuration discussion with the simplest possible EIGRP con-\\nfiguration. This configuration uses as many defaults as possible, but it does enable EIGRP on each router on all the interfaces shown in Figure 10-1. All three routers   can use the exact same configuration, with only two commands required on each router.\\nSubnet 10.1.2.0G0/0\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1 S0/0/0S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0G0/0\\nG0/0S0/0/1 Subnet 10.1.5.0Subnet 10.1.4.0Subnet 10.1.6.0Subnet 10.1.3.0\\nR3\\nR2 R1\\nFigure 10-1 Sample Internetwork Used in Most of the EIGRP Examples\\nExample 10-1 EIGRP Configuration on All Three Routers in Figure 10-1\\nrouter eigrp 1\\n network 10.0.0.0\\nThis simple configuration only uses two parameters that the network engineer must choose: \\nthe autonomous system number and the classful network number in the network  \\ncommand.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A, C 2 C, D 3 D 4 C 5 C 6 A 7 B\\nptg17396363248  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe actual ASN does not matter, but all    the routers must use the same ASN in the router \\neigrp  command. For instance, they all use router eigrp 1  in this example. (Routers that use \\ndifferent ASNs will not become EIGRP neighbors.) The range of valid ASNs is 1 through \\n65,535, which is the same range of valid process IDs with the router ospf  command.\\nThe EIGRP network  command allows two syntax options: one with a wildcard mask at the \\nend and one without, as shown with Example 10-1’s network 10.0.0.0  command. With no \\nwildcard mask listed, this command must list a classful network (a Class A, B, or C network number). Once configured, this command   tells the router to do the following:\\n■Look for that router’s own interfaces with addresses in that classful network\\n■Enable EIGRP on those interfaces\\nOnce enabled, EIGRP starts advertising about the subnet connected to an interface. It also starts sending Hello messages and listening for incoming Hello messages, trying to form neighbor relationships with other EIGRP routers.\\nNOTE Interestingly, on real routers, you can type an EIGRP network number command \\nand use a dotted-decimal number that is not a classful network number; in that case, IOS does not issue an error message. However, IOS changes the number you typed to be the classful network number in which that number resides. For example, IOS changes the network 10.1.1.1 command to network 10.0.0.0.\\nConfiguring EIGRP Using a Wildcard Mask\\nThe EIGRP network  command     syntax without the wildcard mask, as shown in Example \\n10-1, may be exactly what an engineer wants to use, but it also might prove a bit clumsy. For instance, if an engineer wants to enable EIGRP on G0/0, and not on G0/1, and they both have IP addresses in Class A network 10.0.0.0, the \\nnetwork 10.0.0.0  EIGRP subcom-\\nmand would match both interfaces, instead of just G0/0.\\nIOS has a second option for the EIGRP network  command that uses a wildcard mask so \\nthat the engineer can match exactly the correct interface IP addresses intended. In this \\ncase, the network  command does not have to list a classful network  number. Instead, IOS \\nmatches an interface IP address that would be matched if the address and wildcard mask in the \\nnetwork  command were part of an access control list (ACL). The logic works just \\nlike an ACL address and wildcard mask, and just like the wildcard mask logic in the OSPF \\nnetwork  commands discussed in Chapter 8, “Implementing OSPF for IPv4.” (If you do not \\nrecall the details, look to Chapter 16, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists,” for more details about ACL wildcard masks.)\\nFor example, looking back at Figure 10-1, Router R3 has IP addresses in three subnets: \\n10.1.3.0/24, 10.1.4.0/24, and 10.1.6.0/24. Example 10-2 shows an alternate EIGRP configu-ration for Router R3 that uses a \\nnetwork  command to match the range of addresses in each \\nsubnet for R3’s three connected subnets. With a subnet mask of /24, each of the network  \\ncommands uses a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.255, with an address parameter of the subnet ID       off one of R3’s interfaces.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  249\\nExample 10-2 Using Wildcard Masks with EIGRP Configuration\\nR3(config)# router eigrp 1\\nR3(config-router)# network 10.1.3.0 0.0.0.255\\nR3(config-router)# network 10.1.4.0 0.0.0.255\\nR3(config-router)# network 10.1.6.0 0.0.0.255\\nAlternatively, R3 could have matched each interface with commands that use a wildcard \\nmask of 0.0.0.0, listing the specific IP address of each interface. For instance, the network \\n10.1.3.3 0.0.0.0  command would match R3’s LAN interface address     of 10.1.3.3, enabling \\nEIGRP on that one interface.\\nNOTE EIGRP for IPv4 supports      two different configuration styles: classic mode  (also \\ncalled autonomous system mode ) and named mode . In classic mode, which was the first \\nof these two methods to be added to IOS, the router eigrp  command uses an ASN. In \\nnamed mode, the router eigrp  command references a name instead of an ASN, hence the \\nterm EIGRP named mode. This chapter discusses classic mode only.\\nVerifying EIGRP Core Features\\nLike OSPF, EIGRP uses three tables to match its three major blocks of logic: a neighbor table, a topology table, and the IPv4 routing table. But before EIGRP even attempts to build these tables, IOS must connect the configuration logic to its local interfaces. Once enabled on an interface, a router can then start to build its three tables.\\nThe next several pages walk through the verification steps to confirm a working internet-\\nwork that uses EIGRP. Figure 10-2 shows the progression of concepts from top to bottom on the left, with a reference for the various \\nshow  commands     on the right.

From that figure, Routers R1 and R2 use the EIGRP configuration Example 10-1, and Router R3 uses the configuration shown in Example 10-2. Also, note that all routers use Gigabit LAN interfaces that currently operate at 100 Mbps due to their connections to some 10/100 switch ports; this fact impacts the EIGRP metrics to a small degree.\\nFinding the Interfaces on Which EIGRP Is Enabled\\nExample 10-3 begins the verification process by connecting the configuration to the router interfaces on which EIGRP is enabled. IOS gives us three ways      to find the list of interfaces:\\n■Use show running-config  to look at the EIGRP and interface configuration, and apply\\nthe same logic as EIGRP to find the list of interfaces on which EIGRP should be enabled.\\n■Use show ip protocols  to list a shorthand version of the EIGRP configuration, to again\\napply the same logic as EIGRP and predict the list of interfaces.\\n■Use show ip eigrp interfaces  to list the interfaces on which the router has actually\\nenabled EIGRP.\\nOf these three options, only the show ip eigrp interfaces  command gives us the true list \\nof interfaces as actually chosen by the router. The other two methods give us the configura-tion, and let us make an educated guess. (Both are important!)\\nThe \\nshow ip eigrp interfaces  command lists     EIGRP-enabled interfaces directly, and brief-\\nly, with one line per interface. Alternatively, the show ip eigrp interfaces detail  command \\nlists much more detail per interface, including the Hello and Hold Intervals, as     well as noting \\nwhether split horizon is enabled. Example 10-3 shows an example of both from Router R1.\\nExample 10-3 Looking for Interfaces on Which EIGRP Has Been Enabled on R1\\nR1# show ip eigrp interfaces\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Interfaces for AS(1)\\nXmit Queue  PeerQ        Mean Pacing Time  Multicast  Pending\\nInterface Peers  Un/Reliable Un/Reliable  SRTT Un/Reliable  Flow Timer RoutesGi0/0 0 0/0 0/0 0     0/0 0 0\\nSe0/0/0     1 0/0 0/0 2     0/16 50 0\\nSe0/0/1     1 0/0 0/0 1     0/15 50 0\\nR1# show ip eigrp interfaces detail S0/0/0EIGRP-IPv4 Interfaces for AS(1)\\nXmit Queue  PeerQ Mean Pacing Time Multicast  Pending\\nInterface  Peers  Un/Reliable Un/Reliable SRTT Un/Reliable Flow Timer RoutesSe0/0/0 1 0/0 0/0 2     0/16 50 0\\n  Hello-interval is 5, Hold-time is 15\\n  Split-horizon is enabled\\n! lines omitted for brevity  \\nNote that the first command, show ip eigrp interfaces , lists all interfaces for which EIGRP \\nis enabled and for which the router is currently sending Hello messages trying to find new \\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  251\\nEIGRP neighbors. R1, with a single network 10.0.0.0  EIGRP subcommand, enables EIGRP \\non all three of its interfaces (per Figure 10-1). The second command lists          more detail per \\ninterface, including the local router’s own Hello Interval and hold time and the split-horizon setting.\\nNote that neither command lists information about interfaces on which EIGRP is not \\nenabled. For instance, had EIGRP not been enabled on S0/0/0, the \\nshow ip eigrp \\ninterfaces detail S0/0/0  command would have simply listed no information under \\nthe heading lines. The shorter output of the show ip eigrp interface  command omits \\ninterfaces on which EIGRP is not enabled.\\nAlso, note that the show ip eigrp interfaces…  command does not list information \\nfor passive interfaces. Like Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), EIGRP supports the \\npassive-interface  type number  subcommand. On passive interfaces, EIGRP does not \\ndiscover and form neighbor relationships. However, EIGRP still advertises about       the subnet \\nconnected to the passive interface.\\nIn summary, the show ip eigrp interfaces  command lists information about interfaces \\nenabled by EIGRP, but it does not list interfaces made passive for EIGRP.The other two methods to find the EIGRP-enabled interfaces require an examination of \\nthe configuration and some thinking about the EIGRP rules. In real life, \\nshow ip eigrp \\ninterfaces  is the place to start, but for the exam, you might have just the configuration, \\nor you might not even have that. As an alternative, the show ip protocols  command \\nlists many details about EIGRP, including a shorthand repeat of the EIGRP network  \\nconfiguration          commands. Example 10-4 lists these commands as gathered from Router R1.\\nExample 10-4 Using show ip protocols to Derive the List of EIGRP-Enabled Interfaces\\non R1\\nR1# show ip protocols\\n*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***\\nRouting Protocol is \"eigrp 1\"\\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Default networks flagged in outgoing updates\\n  Default networks accepted from incoming updates\\n  EIGRP-IPv4 Protocol for AS(1)    Metric weight K1=1, K2=0, K3=1, K4=0, K5=0\\n    NSF-aware route hold timer is 240\\n    Router-ID: 10.1.5.1\\n    Topology: 0 (base)\\nActive Timer: 3 min\\nDistance: internal 90 external 170\\nMaximum path: 4\\nMaximum hopcount 100\\nMaximum metric variance 1\\n  Automatic Summarization: disabled  Maximum path: 4\\nptg17396363252  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    10.0.0.0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n    10.1.4.3 90 00:22:32\\n    10.1.5.2 90 00:22:32\\n  Distance: internal 90 external 170\\nTo see the shorthand repeat of the EIGRP configuration, look toward the end of the exam-\\nple, under the heading Routing for Networks. In this case, the next line that     lists 10.0.0.0 is a direct reference to the \\nnetwork 10.0.0.0  configuration command shown in Example \\n10-1. \\nFor configurations that use the wildcard mask option, the format of the show ip protocols  \\ncommand differs a little. Example 10-5 shows an excerpt of the show ip protocols  com-\\nmand from R3. R3 uses the three network  commands shown earlier      in Example 10-2.\\nExample 10-5 EIGRP Wildcard Masks Listed with show ip protocols on R3\\nR3# show ip protocols\\n!

The output lists a number in     the format of / x (in this case, /24). \\nIt represents a wildcard mask with x binary 0s, or in this case, 0.0.0.255.\\nBefore moving on from the show ip protocols  command, take a moment to read some \\nof the other details of this command’s output from Example 10-4. For instance, it lists the \\nEIGRP router ID (RID), which for R1 is 10.1.5.1. EIGRP allocates     its RID just like OSPF, based on the following:\\n1. The value configured with the eigrp router-id number EIGRP subcommand\\n2. The numerically highest IP address of an up/up loopback interface at the time the\\nEIGRP process comes up\\n3. The numerically highest IP address of a nonloopback interface at the time the EIGRP\\nprocess comes up\\nThe only difference compared to OSPF is that the EIGRP RID is configured with the \\neigrp \\nrouter-id  value  router subcommand, whereas OSPF uses the          router-id  value  subcom-\\nmand.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  253\\nDisplaying EIGRP Neighbor Status\\nOnce a router has enabled EIGRP        on an interface, the router tries to discover neighboring \\nrouters by listening for EIGRP Hello messages. If two neighboring routers hear Hellos from each other and the required parameters match correctly, the routers become neighbors.\\nThe best and most obvious command to   list EIGRP neighbors is \\nshow ip eigrp neighbors . \\nThis command lists neighbors based on their interface IP address (and not based on their \\nrouter ID, which is the convention with OSPF). The output also lists the local router’s inter-face out which the neighbor is reachable.\\nFor instance, Example 10-6 shows Router R1’s neighbors, listing a neighbor with IP address \\n10.1.4.3 (R3). It is reachable from R1’s S0/0/1 interface according to the first highlighted line in the example.\\nExample 10-6 Displaying EIGRP Neighbors from Router R1\\nR1# show ip eigrp neighbors\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Neighbors for AS(1)\\nH   Address                 Interface Hold Uptime   SRTT   RTO  Q  Seq\\n(sec) (ms) Cnt Num\\n1   10.1.4.3 Se0/0/1 13 00:05:49    2   100  0  29\\n0   10.1.5.2 Se0/0/0 12 00:05:49    2   100  0  39\\nThe right side of the output also lists some interesting statistics. The four rightmost columns \\nhave to do with RTP, as discussed in Chapter 9, “Understanding EIGRP Concepts.” The uptime lists the elapsed time since the neighbor relationship started. Finally, the hold time should be the current countdown from the Hold Interval (15 seconds in this case) down toward 0. In this case, with a Hello Interval of 5 and a Hold Interval of 15, this counter will vary from 15 down to 10 and then reset to 15 when the next Hello arrives.\\nAnother less-obvious way to list EIGRP neighbors is the \\nshow ip protocols  command. \\nLook back again to Example 10-4, to the end of the show ip protocols  command   out-\\nput from R1. That output under the heading Routing Information Sources lists the same \\ntwo neighboring routers’ IP addresses, as does the show ip eigrp neighbors  command        in \\nExample 10-6.\\nDisplaying the IPv4 Routing Table\\nOnce EIGRP routers become neighbors, they exchange      routing information, store it in their topology tables, and then calculate their best IPv4 routes. This section skips past the verification steps for the EIGRP topology table, saving that for the second major topic in the chapter, as an end to itself. However, you should find the IP routing table verification steps somewhat familiar at this point. Example 10-7 shows a couple of examples from R1 in Figure 10-1: the first showing the entire IPv4 routing table, and the second with the \\nshow \\nip route eigrp  command listing only EIGRP-learned routes.\\nExample 10-7 IP Routing Table on Router R1 from Figure 10-1\\nR1# show ip route\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\nD - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter areaN1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2\\nptg17396363254  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nE1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2\\ni - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2\\nia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route\\no - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP\\n+ - replicated route, % - next hop override\\nGateway of last resort is not set\\n10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 2 masks\\nC 10.1.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0L 10.1.1.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nD 10.1.2.0/24 [90/2172416] via 10.1.5.2, 00:06:39, Serial0/0/0\\nD 10.1.3.0/24 [90/2172416] via 10.1.4.3, 00:00:06, Serial0/0/1C 10.1.4.0/24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1\\nL 10.1.4.1/32 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1\\nC 10.1.5.0/24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0\\nL 10.1.5.1/32 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0D 10.1.6.0/24 [90/2681856] via 10.1.5.2, 00:12:20, Serial0/0/0\\n[90/2681856] via 10.1.4.3, 00:12:20, Serial0/0/1\\nR1# show ip route eigrp\\n!

Cisco chose     to use D to represent EIGRP because when EIGRP was \\ncreated, the letter E was already being used for a (now-extinct) Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) routing protocol. Cisco chose the next-closest unused letter, D, to denote EIGRP-learned routes.\\nNext, take a moment to think about the EIGRP routes learned by R1 versus R1’s connected \\nroutes. Six subnets exist in the design in Figure 10-1: three on the LANs, and three on the WANs. The first command in the example lists three of these subnets as connected routes (10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.4.0/24, and 10.1.5.0/24). The other three subnets appear as EIGRP-learned routes.\\nFinally, note that the two numbers in brackets      for each route list the administrative distance \\nand the composite metric, respectively. IOS uses the administrative distance to choose the better route when IOS learns multiple routes for the same subnet but from two differ-ent sources of routing information. Refer back to the “Administrative Distance” section in Chapter 7, “Understanding OSPF Concepts,” for a review.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  255\\nEIGRP Metrics, Successors, and Feasible Successors\\nBoth OSPF and EIGRP use similar big ideas: enabling the protocol on the router’s interfaces, \\nforming neighbor relationships, building topology tables, and adding IPv4 routes to the routing table. These two routing protocols differ most in the topology data they create and use. As a link-state protocol, OSPF creates and saves a lot of topology data, enough data to model the entire network topology in an area. EIGRP saves different kinds of data, in less detail, and uses a completely different algorithm to analyze the data.\\nThis second major section in this chapter focuses on the details of the EIGRP topology \\ndatabase and specifically on the key ideas stored in the database. To review, as defined in Chapter 9, an EIGRP successor route is a router’s best route to reach a subnet. Any of the other possible loop-free routes that can be used if the successor route fails are called feasi-ble successor (FS) routes. And all the information used to determine which route is the suc-cessor, and which of the other routes meets the requirements to be an FS route, sits inside the EIGRP topology table.\\nThis section demonstrates how to use \\nshow  commands to identify successor routes and FS \\nroutes by looking at the EIGRP topology table. To make the discussion more interesting, \\nthe examples in this section use an expanded sample network that will result in multiple routes to reach each subnet, as shown in Figure 10-3.\\nS0/0/0 S0/0/1 Subnet 10.1.5.0S0/1/0 S0/1/0 Subnet 10.1.7.0G0/0Subnet 10.1.3.0\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0G0/0S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1 S0/0/0S0/0/1\\nSubnet 10.1.4.0 Subnet 10.1.8.0Subnet 10.1.6.0\\nSubnet 10.1.2.0G0/0R2R3G0/0Subnet 10.1.33.0\\nR1S0/1/0S0/0/1R4\\nFigure 10-3 Expanded Sample Internetwork with Multiple Routes to Each Subnet\\nViewing the EIGRP Topology Table\\nTo begin, first consider the EIGRP topology table    in Router R1, with this expanded net-work of Figure 10-3. The new network has five WAN and four LAN subnets, with multiple routes to reach each subnet. All the links use default bandwidth and delay settings. (Like the earlier examples, note that all router Gigabit interfaces happen to autonegotiate to use a speed of 100 Mbps, which changes the interface delay setting and therefore the EIGRP metric calculations.)\\nptg17396363256  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 10-8 begins the discussion with the output of the   show ip eigrp topology  com-\\nmand from R1. This command lists a few lines of information about each known subnet in \\nR1’s EIGRP topology table.\\nExample 10-8 EIGRP Topology Table on Router R1\\nR1# show ip eigrp topology\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Topology Table for AS(1)/ID(10.1.5.1)\\nCodes: P - Passive, A - Active, U - Update, Q - Query, R - Reply,\\nr - reply Status, s - sia Status\\nP 10.1.5.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2169856\\nvia Connected, Serial0/0/0\\nP 10.1.7.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2681856\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2681856/2169856), Serial0/0/1\\nP 10.1.3.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2172416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2172416/28160), Serial0/0/1\\nP 10.1.2.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2172416\\nvia 10.1.5.2 (2172416/28160), Serial0/0/0\\nP 10.1.6.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 2681856\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2681856/2169856), Serial0/0/1via 10.1.5.2 (2681856/2169856), Serial0/0/0\\nP 10.1.4.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2169856\\nvia Connected, Serial0/0/1\\nP 10.1.33.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 2684416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/1\\nvia 10.1.5.2 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/0\\nP 10.1.1.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 28160\\nvia Connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nP 10.1.8.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2681856\\nvia 10.1.5.2 (2681856/2169856), Serial0/0/0\\nFirst, look through all the output, and count the subnets, in the lines that align with the left \\nedge of the example. Note that R1 lists a group of messages for all nine subnets, including the connected subnets off R1. EIGRP keeps its topology information about all the subnets, even the connected subnets.\\nNext, focus on the first highlighted entry, for subnet 10.1.3.0/24, the subnet off R3’s LAN \\ninterface. The first line for a given subnet lists the subnet ID and mask. It also lists the num-ber of successor routes, and the   feasible distance (FD). (As a reminder, the FD    is the metric of the successor route, which is the best route to reach a particular subnet.)\\nTo help make sure the items are clear, Figure 10-4 breaks down these items, using these \\nsame details about subnet 10.1.3.0/24 from R1’s EIGRP topology table.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  257\\nNumber of Successors\\nFeasible Distance (FD)\\nOutgoing Interface Metric \\nReported Distance (RD) Next-Hop RouterSubnet/Mask\\nP 10.1.3.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2172416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2172416/28160), Serial0/0/1\\nFigure 10-4 Reference to Fields in the Output from show ip eigrp  topology\\nContinuing to focus on subnet 10.1.3.0/24 for a few more moments, the output lists one \\nline per destination subnet and then one line per route below it, indented, beginning with the word \\nvia. In Figure 10-4, the main line (as usual) lists the subnet, prefix mask, the num-\\nber of successor routes, and the FD. The second (indented) line lists information about the route, with the next-hop router (after the word \\nvia), and the outgoing interface. If the rout-\\ner puts this particular route into the IP routing table, the IP route would use this next-hop IP address and local outgoing interface in that route. Note that EIGRP can list multiple such lines that begin with \\nvia if EIGRP has multiple possible routes for that subnet.\\nFinally, note that the show ip eigrp topology  command also lists two calculated EIGRP \\nmetrics in parentheses. The first is the metric as calculated by the local router for that route. The second is the reported distance (RD): the metric   calculated from the perspective of the next-hop router. In the example shown in Figure 10-4, the RD of 28,160 is R1’s RD    for that route, which is the metric on next-hop router 10.1.4.3 (R3).\\nFinding Successor Routes\\nUnfortunately, the show ip eigrp topology  command      does not make it obvious which \\nroutes are successor (in other words, best) routes and which ones are feasible successor (in other words, quickly used loop-free replacement) routes. The next few pages walk through how to look at the data in the output of this command and identify the successor and FS routes.\\nFirst, for perspective, note that the output in Example 10-8 lists only successor routes, with \\nno feasible successor routes. No routes happen to qualify as feasible successor routes in this network with all default bandwidth and delay settings. Upcoming Example 10-11 changes some settings, causing some routes to be feasible successors. For now, just note that all routes listed in Example 10-8 are successor routes.\\nThe best way to recognize successor routes is that the successor route has the same metric \\nvalue as the FD. The first line of topology output for a subnet lists the FD (that is, the best metric among all the routes to reach that destination subnet). The successor route, by defi-nition, has the best metric, so the successor route’s metric should equal the FD. As shown in Figure 10-5, just look for the FD on the first line and then for the individual routes that have the same metric in the first number inside parentheses.\\nptg17396363258  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFeasible Distance (FD) Metric P 10.1.3.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2172416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2172416/28160), Serial0/0/1 Successor\\n= \\nFigure 10-5 Identifying the Successor: FD (First Line) = Metric (Second Line)\\nWhen EIGRP calculates the metrics for all possible routes, sometimes one clear winner \\nexists, so EIGRP chooses one successor route (as shown in Figure 10-5). However, in other cases, the metrics for competing routes for the same subnet tie. In that case, with default EIGRP configuration settings, EIGRP supports a feature called \\nequal-cost load balancing , \\nwhich tells EIGRP to treat all the routes that tie as successor routes.\\nExample 10-9 shows two successor routes. The example shows an excerpt of the R1 EIGRP \\ntopology table for R1’s route to subnet 10.1.33.0/24. That subnet exists off R4’s LAN inter-face. In this case, R1 lists two routes, out two different interfaces to two different neighbor-ing next-hop routers. Both routes list the same metric, which matches the FD (2,684,416), so both are        successor routes.\\nExample 10-9 Displaying Two Successor Routes on R1 for Subnet 10.1.33.0/24\\nR1# show ip eigrp topology | section 10.1.33.0\\nP 10.1.33.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 2684416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/1via 10.1.5.2 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/0\\nIn this case, with default settings, R1 would add both routes to its IP routing table. Later in \\nthis chapter, the section “EIGRP Maximum Paths and Variance” discusses some similar logic of how a router deals with somewhat equal-cost routes to the      same subnet. That section also gives a little more insight into the equal-cost load-balancing option.\\nNOTE The command in Example 10-9 pipes the output of the \\nshow ip eigrp topology  \\ncommand to the section  command. This process asks IOS to find a section or group of \\nmessages with the listed text (in this case, 10.1.33.0) and display only that group of mes-sages. It is just a way to getting the desired subset of the output without listing the entire command.\\nFinding Feasible Successor Routes\\nThe show ip eigrp topology  command lists both       successor and feasible successor routes \\nwhen both exist. The examples so far in this chapter, which used all default bandwidth and delay settings, simply did not happen to result in any FS routes. The next topic changes the configuration, creating an FS route, and then shows how to recognize this route in the topology database.\\nFirst, consider Example 10-9’s listing of R1’s topology data for subnet 10.1.33.0/24, the \\nLAN subnet off R4. From R1’s perspective, with all default bandwidth and delay settings, two routes are as identical as they can be. The route from R1 through R3 uses two serial links with default settings for bandwidth of 1544 Kbps and delay of 20,000 microseconds \\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  259\\non all the serial links. The route from R1 through R2 also uses two serial links, also with \\ndefault bandwidth and delay. As a result, R1 has the two equal-cost routes for subnet 10.1.33.0/24, as shown on the left side of Figure 10-6.\\nCurrentR1R3\\nR2R4Successor\\nR1R3\\nR2R410.1.33.0 10.1.33.0\\nSuccessorSuccessor\\nFutureFeasible SuccessorS0/1/0\\nFigure 10-6 Comparing Two Successor Routes to One Successor and One FS\\nThe next example makes the route through R2 worse than the route through R3, by simply lowering the bandwidth on R2’s serial link connected to R4. Currently, the path R1-R2-R4 has, from R1’s perspective, a slowest bandwidth of 1544 Kbps. By lowering the bandwidth to some other number lower than 1544 Kbps, the metrics of the two routes will no longer exactly tie. A slightly lower bandwidth will result in the upper R1-R3-R4 route being the       only successor route, with the R1-R2-R4 route being an FS route.\\nFirst, to change the configuration to use a worse (slower) slowest bandwidth, Example \\n10-10 shows R2’s S0/1/0 configuration being changed     with the \\nbandwidth 1400  com-\\nmand.\\nExample 10-10 Tuning EIGRP Routes by Changing Interface Bandwidth\\nR2# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The other routers learn some new information, and they recalculate their own metrics, and the RD values, as appropriate. To see the differences, Example 10-11 repeats the \\nshow ip eigrp topology | section 10.1.33.0  command on R1, as last seen in Example \\n10-9. In Example 10-9, that command showed R1 with two successor routes for this subnet. Now, in Example 10-11, R1 has only one successor route, but with the FS actually hidden   there in the output, as explained after the example.\\nExample 10-11 Viewing a Feasible Successor Route on R1 for 10.1.33.0/24\\nR1# show ip eigrp topology | section 10.1.33.0\\nP 10.1.33.0/24, 1 successors, FD is 2684416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/1\\nvia 10.1.5.2 (2854912/2342912), Serial0/0/0\\nptg17396363260  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo see the feasible successor route, and why it is an FS, work through the various numbers \\nin the output in Example 10-11.

The next example shows the convergence process, with R1 losing its current successor route to 10.1.33.0/24, through R3, and replacing it with the FS route through R2, as shown in Figure 10-8.\\nExample 10-12 shows not only the net results of the failover and convergence, but also the \\nprocess by using some debug messages. Be warned, some of the debug messages might not make a lot of sense. However, the example removes some of the less-useful messages, and highlights the more understandable output, to demonstrate what happens with the failover.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  261\\nFailover to\\nFeasible SuccessorSuccessor\\nR1R3\\nR2R410.1.33.0\\nFigure 10-8 Diagram of the Convergence Event Described in the Next Example\\nFor this example, the link between R3 and R4 is disabled ( shutdown ).

The last command lists the new IPv4 route, with        the new FD listed as the metric in brackets, and R2 (10.1.5.2) as the new next-hop router.\\nptg17396363262  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExamining the Metric Components\\nMost of the discussion about metrics   in this chapter so far has centered on the composite \\nEIGRP metric—that is, the rather large integer metric that is the result of the metric calcula-tion on the local router. However, EIGRP does not advertise the composite metric. Instead, EIGRP advertises different metric components, and then uses some of those components to calculate the composite metric. Before leaving this discussion about choosing successor routes (with the best metric), and FS routes (loop-free backup routes), all based on their composite metrics, this short topic shows how to look at the individual metric components stored by EIGRP.\\nWhen using the defaults (which Cisco recommends), EIGRP bases its composite metric \\ncalculation on the minimum bandwidth link in a route and the total delay for all links in the route. However, the EIGRP routers still advertise all the metric components, which include the link reliability and load. Example 10-13 lists the output from the \\nshow ip eigrp \\ntopology 10.1.3.0/24  command on Router R1, a command that lists the details of the \\nEIGRP topology data for the routes for this subnet. The highlighted lines in the example list the composite metric as well       as the individual components of the metric.\\nExample 10-13 EIGRP Metric Components as Shown in the EIGRP Topology Database\\nR1# show ip eigrp topology 10.1.3.0/24\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Topology Entry for AS(1)/ID(10.1.13.1) for 10.1.3.0/24\\n  State is Passive, Query origin flag is 1, 1 Successor(s), FD is 2172416\\n  Descriptor Blocks:\\n  10.1.4.3 (Serial0/0/1), from 10.1.4.3, Send flag is 0x0\\nComposite metric is (2172416/28160), route is InternalVector metric:\\nMinimum bandwidth is 1544 Kbit\\nTotal delay is 20100 microsecondsReliability is 255/255Load is 1/255\\nMinimum MTU is 1500\\nHop count is 1\\nOriginating router is 3.3.3.3\\n  10.1.5.2 (Serial0/0/0), from 10.1.5.2, Send flag is 0x0\\nComposite metric is (2684416/2172416), route is Internal\\nVector metric:\\nMinimum bandwidth is 1544 Kbit\\nTotal delay is 40100 microseconds\\nReliability is 255/255\\nLoad is 1/255\\nMinimum MTU is 1500\\nHop count is 2\\nOther EIGRP Configuration Settings\\nSo far, this chapter has focused on the core functions of EIGRP. The configuration details \\nhave been relatively sparse, just due to the nature of EIGRP. However, this chapter has \\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  263\\nspent a fair amount of time and effort to show the results of enabling EIGRP on the routers \\nin a network, showing EIGRP working on interfaces, creating neighbor relationships, learn-ing topology information, and ultimately adding routes to the IP routing table.\\nThis third and final major section of this chapter turns away from these core features. The \\ntopics in this section are either completely optional or have default settings that the chapter has not discussed so far. This section now examines this small set of other EIGRP topics, including load balancing, EIGRP metric tuning, and autosummary.\\nLoad Balancing Across Multiple EIGRP Routes\\nLike OSPF, EIGRP supports     the ability to put multiple equal-metric routes in the IPv4 routing table. Like OSPF, EIGRP defaults to support four such routes for each subnet. That number of concurrent routes to each subnet can be configured with the \\nmaximum-paths  number  \\nEIGRP subcommand. (Note that the maximum number of equal-cost paths depends on the IOS version and router platform.)\\nIn fact, Example 10-9, earlier in this chapter, showed just such an example, with Router \\nR1’s route for subnet 10.1.33.0/24. Example 10-14 revisits that same scenario, this time with both the topology table and the IP routing table displayed. Due to the default EIGRP configuration setting of \\nmaximum-paths 4 , R1 places both   successor routes into R1’s IP \\nrouting table.\\nExample 10-14 R1’s Routing Table with Multiple Equal-Cost EIGRP Routes\\nR1# show ip eigrp topology | section 10.1.33.0\\nP 10.1.33.0/24, 2 successors, FD is 2684416\\nvia 10.1.4.3 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/1\\nvia 10.1.5.2 (2684416/2172416), Serial0/0/0\\nR1# show ip route | section 10.1.33.0\\nD 10.1.33.0/24 [90/2684416] via 10.1.5.2, 00:02:23, Serial0/0/0\\n[90/2684416] via 10.1.4.3, 00:02:23, Serial0/0/1\\nAlthough the ability to add multiple routes with exactly equal metrics may be useful, \\nEIGRP often calculates similar metric values that are not exactly equal. EIGRP metrics often range into the millions, making it less likely that metrics would be exactly the same.\\nIOS also includes the concept of      \\nunequal-cost load balancing  using an EIGRP setting \\ncalled variance , to overcome this problem. Variance allows routes whose metrics are rela-\\ntively close in value to be considered equal, allowing multiple unequal-metric routes to the \\nsame subnet to be added to the routing table.\\nThe variance  multiplier  EIGRP router   subcommand defines an integer between 1 and 128. \\nThe router then multiplies the variance times a route’s FD—the best metric with which to \\nreach that subnet. Any FS routes whose metric is less than the product of the variance times the FD are considered to be equal routes and may be placed in the routing table, depending on the setting of the \\nmaximum-paths  command.\\nThe previous paragraph does summarize the rules for variance and unequal-cost load balanc-ing, but working through the idea with an example works much better. To keep the num-bers more obvious, Table 10-2 lists an example with small metric values. The table lists the \\nptg17396363264  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nmetric for three routes to the same subnet, as calculated on Router R4. The table also lists \\nthe neighboring routers’ RD and the decision to add routes to the routing table based on       various variance settings.\\nTable 10-2 Example of Routes Chosen as Equal Because of Variance\\nNext \\nHopMetric RD Added to Routing \\nTable at Variance 1?Added to Routing Table at Variance 2?Added to Routing Table at Variance 3?\\nR1 5 0 3 0 Ye s Ye s Ye s\\nR2 90 40 No Y es Y es\\nR3 120 60 No No No\\nBefore considering the variance, note that in this case the route through R1 is the successor \\nroute because it has the lowest metric. This also means that the metric for the route through R1, 50, is the FD. The route through R2 is an FS route because its RD of 40 is less than the FD of 50. The route through R3 is not an FS route because its RD of 60 is more than the FD of 50.\\nAt a default configuration of variance 1, the metrics must be exactly equal to be considered \\nequal, so only the successor route is added to the routing table.With the variance 2 command configured, the FD (50) is multiplied by the variance (2) for a \\nproduct of 100. The route through R2, with metric 90, is less than the calculated variance × FD = 100, so R4 adds the route through R2 to the routing table as well. The router can then load balance traffic across these two routes. The third route’s metric, 120, is more than the calculated variance × FD = 100, so it is not added to the routing table.\\nWith the variance 3 command configured, the product of the FD (50) times 3 results in \\na product of 150, and all three routes’ calculated metrics are less than 150. However, the route through R3 is not an FS route, so it cannot be added to the routing table for fear of causing a routing loop.\\nThe following list summarizes the key points about     variance:\\n■The variance is multiplied by the current FD (the metric of the best route to reach the\\nsubnet).\\n■Any FS routes whose calculated metric is less than or equal to the product of variance\\ntimes the FD are added to the IP routing table, assuming that the maximum-paths  set-\\nting allows more routes.\\n■Routes that are neither successor nor FS can never be added to the IP routing table,\\nregardless of the variance setting, because doing so may cause packets to loop.\\nAs soon as the routes have been added to the routing table, the router supports a variety of \\noptions for how to load balance traffic across the routes. The router can balance the traffic proportionally with the metrics, meaning that lower-metric routes send more packets. The router can send all traffic over the lowest-metric route, with the other routes just being in the routing table for faster convergence in case the best route fails. However, the details of the load-balancing process require a much deeper discussion of the internals of the forward-ing process in IOS, and     this topic is beyond the scope of this book.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  265\\nTuning the EIGRP Metric Calculation\\nBy default, EIGRP calculates an integer composite metric based on interface bandwidth and \\ndelay. You can change the settings on any interface using the bandwidth  value  and the \\ndelay  value  interface subcommands, which in turn influences a router’s choice of routes.\\nCisco recommends setting each interface’s bandwidth       to an accurate value, rather than set-ting the bandwidth to some inaccurate value for the purpose of changing EIGRP’s metric calculation. Router serial links should be configured with the \\nbandwidth  speed  command, \\nwith a speed  value in kilobits per second (Kbps), matching the interface’s actual speed. \\nRouter Ethernet interfaces can use default settings; by default, IOS actually changes the router Ethernet interface bandwidth setting to match the actual physical transmission speed.\\nBecause the delay interface setting       impacts fewer other IOS features, Cisco recommends \\nthat if you want to tune the EIGRP metric, change the interface delay settings. To change an interface’s delay setting, use the \\ndelay  value  command, where the value  is a delay setting \\nwith an unusual unit: tens of microseconds. Interestingly, the EIGRP metric formula also uses the unit of tens of microseconds; however, \\nshow  commands list the delay with a unit \\nof microseconds, as shown in Example 10-15 with the following details:\\n1. The router’s Fa0/0 has a default delay setting of 100 microseconds (usec), assuming\\nthe interface is actually running at a speed of 100 Mbps.\\n2. The delay 123 command is configured on the interface, meaning 123 tens of micro-\\nseconds.\\n3. The show interfaces fa0/0 command now lists a delay of 1230 microseconds.\\nExample 10-15 Configuring Interface Delay\\nYosemite# show interfaces fa0/0\\nFastEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Hardware is Gt96k FE, address is 0013.197b.5026 (bia 0013.197b.5026)\\n  Internet address is 10.1.2.252/24\\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit, DLY 100 usec,! lines omitted for brevity\\nYosemite# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

This term comes from the fact that these classful routing protocols had to pay more \\nattention to details about Class A, B, and C networks, in part because of the simplicity of \\nthe routing protocol.\\nThese older classful routing protocols also had to use a more careful and cautious subnet \\ndesign plan to avoid a problem called a   discontiguous classful network. These simpler old routing protocols just got confused when a classful network became discontiguous, because of a required feature of classful routing protocols called autosummarization.\\nToday, most enterprises use OSPF or EIGRP, or in rare cases, RIPv2. All these protocols are \\nclassless routing protocols. As a result, these newer routing protocols can be configured so that the old problem with discontiguous classful networks is not a problem at all.\\nHowever, while the more recent IOS versions use good default settings so that this problem \\ncan be ignored, EIGRP allows the possibility     of enabling the autosummary feature, which then requires the network engineer to be aware of this old discontiguous network problem. So, just in case, these next few pages first discuss the autosummary feature, followed by a discussion of the routing problems that can occur as a result.\\nNOTE In real networks, most people simply choose to avoid using autosummary today.\\nAutomatic Summarization at the Boundary of a Classful Network\\nA routing protocol that uses autosummary automatically       creates a summary route under certain conditions. In particular, when a router sits at the boundary between classful net-works—that is, with some interfaces in one Class A, B, or C network and other interfaces in another Class A, B, or C network—the router summarizes routes. Routes from one classful network are summarized as one route to the entire Class A, B, or C network. More formally:\\nRoutes related to subnets in network X, when advertised out an interface whose IP \\naddress is not in network X, are summarized and advertised as one route. That route is for the entire Class A, B, or C network X.\\nAs usual, an example makes the concept much clearer. Consider Figure 10-9, which shows \\ntwo networks in use: 10.0.0.0 and 172.16.0.0. R3 has four (connected) routes to subnets of network 10.0.0.0 on the right, and one interface on the left connected to a different classful network, Class B network 172.16.0.0. As a result, R3, with autosummary enabled, will sum-marize a route for all of Class A network 10.0.0.0.\\nLet’s follow the steps in the figure:\\n1. R3 has autosummary enabled, with the EIGRP auto-summary router subcommand.\\n2. R3 advertises a route for all of Class A network 10.0.0.0, instead of advertising routes\\nfor each subnet inside network 10.0.0.0 because the link to R2 is a link in another net-work (172.16.0.0).\\n3. R2 learns one route in network 10.0.0.0: a route to 10.0.0.0/8, which represents all ofnetwork 10.0.0.0, with R3 as the next-hop router.\\nptg1739636310Chapter 10: Implementing EIGRP for IPv4  267\\nR3 R210.3.4.0\\n10.3.5.0\\n10.3.6.0\\n10.3.7.0S0/0/0I Only Know \\nAbout 10.0.0.0/8 -\\nNo Subnets!\\n172.16.3.0/24\\nNot in 10.0.0.0I Have a Route\\nto 10.0.0.0/8\\n172.16.1.0/24\\nNot in 10.0.0.03.3\\n12 3\\nFigure 10-9 Autosummarization\\nExample 10-16 shows the output of the show ip route  command         on R2, confirming the \\neffect of the auto-summary  setting on R3.\\nExample 10-16 R2 with a Single Route in Network 10.0.0.0 for the Entire Network\\nR2# show ip route eigrp\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nD     10.0.0.0/8 [90/2297856] via 172.16.3.3, 00:12:59, Serial0/0/0\\nNote that auto-summary  by itself causes no problems. In the design shown in Figure 10-9, \\nand in the command output in Example 10-16, no problems exist. R2 can forward packets \\nto all subnets of network 10.0.0.0 using the one highlighted summary route, sending       those packets to R3 next.\\nDiscontiguous Classful Networks\\nAutosummarization does not cause any problems        as long as the summarized network is contiguous rather than discontiguous. U.S. residents can appreciate the concept of a discon-tiguous network based on the common term \\ncontiguous 48 , referring to the 48 U.S. states \\nbesides Alaska and Hawaii. To drive to Alaska from the contiguous 48, for example, you must drive through another country (Canada, for the geographically impaired), so Alaska is not contiguous with the 48 states. In other words, it is discontiguous.\\nTo better understand what the terms \\ncontiguous  and discontiguous  mean in networking, \\nrefer to the following two formal definitions when reviewing the example of a discontigu-\\nous classful network that follows:\\n■Contiguous network: A classful network   in which packets sent between every pair of\\nsubnets can pass only through subnets of that same classful network, without having topass through subnets of any other classful network\\n■Discontiguous network: A classful network in   which packets sent between at least onepair of subnets must pass through subnets of a different classful network\\nFigure 10-10 creates an expanded version of the internetwork shown in Figure 10-9 to cre-\\nate an example of a discontiguous network 10.0.0.0. In this design, some subnets of net-work 10.0.0.0 sit off R1 on the left, whereas others still connect to R3 on the right. Packets passing between subnets on the left to subnets on the right must pass through subnets of Class B        network 172.16.0.0.\\n`ptg17396363268  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n172.16.3.0/24R1 R3 R210.3.4.0\\n10.3.5.0\\n10.3.6.0\\n10.3.7.010.2.1.010.2.2.0\\n10.2.3.0\\n10.2.4.0S0/0/0 S0/0/1Which Route to\\nNetwork 10.0.0.0\\nDo I Believe?\\nI Have a Route\\nto 10.0.0.0/8I Have a Routeto 10.0.0.0/8\\n172.16.2.0/242.1 3.3\\nFigure 10-10 Discontiguous Network 10.0.0.0\\nAutosummarization causes problems in that routers like R2 that sit totally outside the dis-\\ncontiguous network become totally confused about how to route packets to the discon-tiguous network. Figure 10-10 shows the idea, with both R1 and R3 advertising a route for 10.0.0.0/8 to R2 in the middle of the network. Example 10-17 shows the resulting routes on Router R2.\\nExample 10-17 R2 Routing Table: Autosummarization Causes Routing Problem with \\nDiscontiguous Network 10.0.0.0\\nR2# show ip route | section 10.0.0.0\\nD     10.0.0.0/8 [90/2297856] via 172.16.3.3, 00:00:15, Serial0/0/0\\n[90/2297856] via 172.16.2.1, 00:00:15, Serial0/0/1\\nAs shown in Example 10-17, R2 now has two routes to network 10.0.0.0/8: one pointing \\nleft toward R1 and one pointing right toward R3. R2 simply uses its usual load-balancing logic, because as far as R2 can tell, the two routes are simply equal-cost routes to the same destination: the entire network 10.0.0.0. Sometimes R2 happens to forward a packet toward the correct destination, and sometimes not.\\nThis problem has two solutions. The old-fashioned solution is to create IP addressing plans \\nthat do not create discontiguous classful networks. The other: Just do not use autosummary, by using EIGRP defaults, or by disabling it with the   \\nno auto-summary  EIGRP subcom-\\nmand.

The routing protocol configuration identifies the interfaces on which the router should use the routing protocol. After identifying those interfaces, a network engi-neer can look at the neighbors each router finds on each interface, searching for neighbors that should exist but do not.\\nThis chapter focuses on issues related to these two main branches of logic: on which inter-\\nfaces should a router enable the routing protocol, and which neighbor relationships should each router create. This chapter relies on the configuration discussed in Chapter 8 for OSPFv2 and in Chapter 10 for EIGRP. This chapter’s troubleshooting discussions emphasize how to find incorrect configuration problems by using only \\nshow  and debug  commands.\\nThis chapter first briefly introduces a few broad concepts related to troubleshooting prob-lems with routing protocols. The next major section examines problems related to which interfaces on which a router enables the routing protocol, with the final major section focusing of routing protocol neighbor relationships. Note that the entire chapter moves back and forth between discussing both Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) and Open Shortest Path First Version 2 (OSPFv2).\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nThe troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters, including some chapters in  \\nCCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide . They \\nalso show you how to approach some of the more challenging questions on the ICND2 and CCNA R&S exams. Therefore, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge level. For these reasons, the troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly confident about troubleshoot-ing OSPFv2 and EIGRP, feel free to move to the “Chapter Review” section near the end of this chapter to bypass the majority of the chapter.\\nptg17396363Foundation Topics\\nPerspectives on Troubleshooting Routing Protocol \\nProblems\\nBecause a routing protocol’s job is to fill a router’s     routing table with the currently best \\nroutes, it makes sense that troubleshooting potential problems with routing protocols could begin with the IP routing table. Given basic information about an internetwork, including the routers, their IP addresses and masks, and the routing protocol, you could calculate the subnet numbers that should be in the router’s routing table and list the likely next-hop routers for each route. For example, Figure 11-1 shows an internetwork with six subnets. Router R1’s routing table should list all six subnets, with three connected routes, two routes learned from R2 (172.16.4.0/24 and 172.16.5.0/24), and one route learned from R3 (172.16.6.0/24).\\n172.16.5.1/24\\n172.16.6.1/24172.16.9.6/30172.16.9.2/30\\n172.16.9.1/30\\n172.16.9.5/30172.16.2.1/24172.16.4.1/24\\nR1R2\\nR3\\nFigure 11-1 Internetwork with Six Subnets\\nSo, one possible troubleshooting process is to analyze the     internetwork, look at the routing \\ntable, and look for missing routes. If one or more expected routes are missing, the next step would be to determine whether that router has learned any routes from the expected next-hop (neighbor) router. The next steps to isolate the problem differ greatly if a router is hav-ing problems forming a neighbor relationship with another router, versus having a working neighbor relationship but not being able to learn all routes.\\nFor example, suppose that R1 in Figure 11-1 has learned a route for subnet 172.16.4.0/24 in \\nFigure 11-1 but not for subnet 172.16.5.0/24. In this case, it is clear that R1 has a working neighbor relationship with R2. In these cases, the root cause of this problem might still be related to the routing protocol, or it might not. For example, the problem may be that R2’s lower LAN interface is down. However, if R1 did not have a route for both 172.16.4.0/24 and 172.16.5.0/24, R1’s neighbor relationship with R2 could be the problem.\\nTroubleshooting routing protocol problems in real internetworks can be very complex—\\nmuch more complex than even the most difficult CCNA R&S exam questions. Defining a generic troubleshooting process with which to attack both simple and complex routing protocol problems would require a lot of space and be counterproductive for preparing for \\nptg17396363274  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nthe CCNA R&S exams. This chapter instead offers a straightforward process for attacking \\nrouting protocol problems—specifically, problems similar to the depth and complexity of the CCNA R&S exams.\\nIf an exam question appears to be related to a problem with a routing protocol, you can \\nquickly identify some common configuration errors with the following process—even if the question does not list the configuration. The process     has three main tasks:\\nStep 1. Examine the internetwork design to determine on which interfaces the routing \\nprotocol should be enabled and which routers are expected to become neighbors.\\nStep 2. Verify whether the routing protocol is enabled on each interface (as per Step 1). If it isn’t, determine the root cause and fix the problem.\\nStep 3. Verify that each router has formed all expected neighbor relationships. If it hasn’t, find the root cause and fix the problem.\\nFor instance, as noted with asterisks in Figure 11-2, each router should enable the routing \\nprotocol on each of the interfaces shown in the figure. Also, routing protocol neighbor rela-tionships      should form between R1 and R2, and R1 and R3, but not between R2 and R3.\\n172.16.5.1/24\\n172.16.6.1/24Neighbor\\n*\\n*****\\n**\\nNeighbor172.16.9.6/30172.16.9.2/30\\n172.16.9.1/30\\n172.16.9.5/30172.16.2.1/24172.16.4.1/24\\nR1R2\\nR3\\nFigure 11-2 Routing Protocol Interfaces and Neighbor Relationships\\nWhile the concepts outlined in Figure 11-2 should be somewhat obvious by now, this chapter \\ndiscusses how some of the most common configuration mistakes can impact the interfaces used by a routing protocol and whether a routing protocol creates neighbor relationships.\\nInterfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol\\nThis section examines the second major troubleshooting step outlined in the previous sec-tion of the chapter: how to verify the interfaces     on which the routing protocol has been enabled. Both EIGRP and OSPF configuration enable the routing protocol on an interface by using the \\nnetwork  router subcommand. For any interfaces matched by the network  \\ncommands, the routing protocol tries the following two actions:\\n■Attempt to find potential neighbors on the subnet connected to the interface\\n■Advertise the subnet connected to that interface\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  275\\nAt the same time, the passive-interface  router subcommand can be configured so that the \\nrouter does not attempt to find neighbors on the interface (the first action just listed), but \\nstill advertises the connected subnet (the second action).\\nThree show  commands are all that is   needed to know exactly which interfaces have been \\nenabled with EIGRP and which interfaces are passive. In particular, the show ip eigrp \\ninterfaces command lists all EIGRP-enabled interfaces that are not passive interfaces. The \\nshow ip protocols  command        essentially lists the contents of the configured network  com-\\nmands for each routing protocol and a separate list of the passive interfaces. Comparing \\nthese two commands identifies all EIGRP-enabled interfaces and those that are passive.\\nFor OSPF, the command works slightly differently, with the show ip ospf interface brief  \\ncommand listing all OSPF-enabled      interfaces (including passive interfaces). Using this com-\\nmand, along with the list of passive interfaces listed by the show ip protocols  command, \\nagain identifies all fully enabled OSPF interfaces as well as all passive interfaces.\\nTable 11-1 summarizes the commands that identify the interfaces on which OSPFv2 and \\nEIGRP are enabled for easier reference.\\nTable 11-1 Key Commands to Find Routing Protocol-Enabled Interfaces\\nCommand Key Information Lists Passive \\nInterfaces?\\nshow ip eigrp interfaces Lists the interfaces on which EIGRP is enabled (based on the \\nnetwork  commands), excluding  passive \\ninterfaces.No\\nshow ip ospf interface brief Lists the interfaces on which the OSPFv2 is enabled (based on the \\nnetwork  router subcommands or ip \\nospf  interface subcommands), including  passive \\ninterfaces.Ye s\\nshow ip protocols Lists the contents of the network  configuration \\ncommands for each routing process, and lists enabled but passive interfaces.Ye s\\nNOTE All the commands in Table 11-1 list the interfaces regardless of interface status, \\nin effect telling you the results of the \\nnetwork  and passive-interface  configuration com-\\nmands.\\nSo, for the major troubleshooting step covered in this section, the task is to use the com-mands in Table 11-1 and analyze the output. First, an EIGRP example will be shown, fol-lowed by an OSPF example.\\nEIGRP Interface Troubleshooting\\nThis section shows a few examples of the    commands in the context of Figure 11-3, which is used in all the examples in this chapter.\\nptg17396363276  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nG0/1G0/0\\nG0/0G0/0G0/0 G0/1\\nG0/1 G0/1\\n10.1.44.4/2410.1.1.4/2410.1.1.1/24 10.1.11.1/24\\n10.1.22.2/24 10.1.1.2/2410.1.1.3/2410.1.33.3/24 R1\\nR2R3\\nR4\\nFigure 11-3 Internetwork for EIGRP/OSPF Troubleshooting Examples\\nThis example includes four routers, with the following scenario in this case:\\n■R1 and R2 are configured correctly on both LAN interfaces.\\n■R3 is mistakenly not enabled with EIGRP on its G0/1 interface.\\n■R4 meant to use a passive-interface G0/1  command because no other routers are\\noff R4’s G0/1 LAN.

This command lists only interfaces on which EIGRP has been enabled, excluding passive interfaces.\\nThe highlighted parts of the show ip protocols command output on each router are particular-\\nly interesting. These sections show the parameters of the configured network commands. The show ip protocols command lists a separate line under the header “Routing for Networks,” one for each configured network command. Example 11-1’s output    suggests R1 has a network \\n10.0.0.0 configuration command (as shown at the beginning of the example), and Example 11-2’s “10.1.0.0/16” suggests R2 has a network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 command.\\nExamining the Problems with EIGRP Interfaces\\nThe next few pages now look at the problems caused by the configuration on Routers R3 and R4.\\nFirst, Example 11-2 gives brief insight into the current      problem caused by R3.

However, R2 has learned only one EIGRP route (10.1.11.0/24), as shown in the \\nshow ip route eigrp  command output. When working properly, R2 should \\nlearn three EIGRP routes—one for each of the other LAN subnets shown in Figure 11-3.\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  279\\nExample 11-3 shows the root cause on R3. First, R3’s show ip eigrp interfaces  command \\nlists G0/0, but not G0/1, so a problem might exist with how EIGRP has been configured \\non G0/1. The configuration at the top of the example lists the root cause: an incorrect \\nnetwork  command, which does not enable EIGRP on R3’s G0/1 interface.\\nExample 11-3 EIGRP Problems on R3\\nR3# show running-config\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nrouter eigrp 99 network 10.1.1.3 0.0.0.0\\n network 10.1.13.3 0.0.0.0\\n auto-summary\\nR3# show ip eigrp interfaces\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Interfaces for AS(99)\\nXmit Queue   PeerQ        Mean   Pacing Time   Multicast    Pending\\nInterface   Peers  Un/Reliable  Un/Reliable  SRTT   Un/Reliable   Flow Timer   Routes\\nGi0/0 2 0/0 0/0 1 0/1 50 0\\nR3# show ip protocols\\n*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***\\nRouting Protocol is \"eigrp 99\"\\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Default networks flagged in outgoing updates\\n  Default networks accepted from incoming updates\\n  EIGRP-IPv4 Protocol for AS(99)\\n    Metric weight K1=1, K2=0, K3=1, K4=0, K5=0\\n    NSF-aware route hold timer is 240\\n    Router-ID: 3.3.3.3\\n    Topology : 0 (base)\\nActive Timer: 3 minDistance: internal 90 external 170\\nMaximum path: 4\\nMaximum hopcount 100\\nMaximum metric variance 1\\n  Automatic Summarization: disabled\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    10.1.1.3/32    10.1.13.3/32\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n    10.1.1.2 90 00:05:14\\n    10.1.1.1 90 00:05:14\\n  Distance: internal 90 external 170\\nptg17396363280  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe root cause of R3’s problem is that R3 has a network 10.1.13.3 0.0.0.0  configura-\\ntion command, which does not match R3’s 10.1.33.3 G0/1 IP address. If the configuration \\nwas not available in the exam question, the show ip protocols  command could be used to \\nessentially see the same configuration details. In this case, the show ip protocols  command \\non R3 lists the text “10.1.13.3/32” as a reference to the contents of the incorrect network  \\ncommand’s      parameters, with “/32” translating to a wildcard mask of 32 binary 0s, or decimal 0.0.0.0.\\nR3’s incorrect configuration means that two actions do not happen on R3’s G0/1 interface. \\nFirst, R3 does not try to find neighbors on its G0/1 interface, which is not a big deal in this case. However, R3 also does not advertise subnet 10.1.33.0/24, the connected subnet off R3’s G0/1 interface.\\nMoving on to R4’s problem, Example 11-4 shows why R1 and R2 do not learn R4’s \\n10.1.44.0/24 subnet. In this case, on R4, the engineer could have correctly used a \\npassive-interface gigabitethernet0/1  router subcommand because no other routers \\nshould exist off R4’s G0/1 interface. However, the engineer mistakenly made R4’s G0/0 interface      passive.\\nExample 11-4 EIGRP Problems on R4\\nR4# show running-config\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nrouter eigrp 99\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n network 10.0.0.0\\n auto-summary\\nR4# show ip eigrp interfaces\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Interfaces for AS(99)\\nXmit Queue   PeerQ        Mean   Pacing Time   Multicast    Pending\\nInterface   Peers  Un/Reliable  Un/Reliable  SRTT   Un/Reliable   Flow Timer   Routes\\nGi0/1 0 0/0 0/0 0 0/1 0 0\\nR4# show ip protocols | begin Routing for Networks\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    10.0.0.0\\n  Passive Interface(s):\\n    GigabitEthernet0/0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n  Distance: internal 90 external 170\\nNOTE The last command on the example, show ip protocols | begin  Routing for \\nNetworks , lists the command output, but starting with the line with the literal case-sensitive \\nstring Routing for Networks .

Also, the highlighted part of R4’s \\nshow ip protocols  command output lists G0/0 as a passive interface, which \\nagain means that R4 does not even attempt to become neighbors with others off its G0/0 interface.\\nOSPF Interface Troubleshooting\\nOSPF has the same basic requirements    as EIGRP for interfaces, with a few exceptions. First, EIGRP routers need to use the same autonomous system number (ASN) as their neighbor-ing routers, as configured in the \\nrouter eigrp  asn global configuration command. OSPF \\nrouters can use any process ID on the router ospf  process-id  command, with no need to \\nmatch their neighbors. Second, OSPF requires     that the interfaces connected to the same subnet be assigned to the same OSPF area, whereas EIGRP has no concept of areas.\\nExample 11-5 shows a mostly working OSPF internetwork, again based on Figure 11-3. The \\nproblem in this case relates to the area design, as shown in Figure 11-4, the revised version of Figure 11-3. All subnets should be placed into area 0. However, the engineer made a configuration mistake on R2, putting both its interfaces into area 1. As a result, R2’s G0/0 interface breaks the OSPF design rule of being in the same subnet as R1, R3, and R4, but     not being in the same OSPF area.\\nG0/1G0/0\\nG0/0G0/0G0/0 G0/1\\nG0/1 G0/1\\n10.1.44.4/2410.1.1.4/2410.1.1.1/24 10.1.11.1/24\\n10.1.22.2/24 10.1.1.2/2410.1.1.3/2410.1.33.3/24R1\\nR2R3\\nR4Intended Design: Area 0 Only\\nIncorrect Configuration: Area 1\\nFigure 11-4 Intended Area Design Using Only Area 0, with R2 Breaking the Design\\nExample 11-5 begins to break down the problem by looking at the status of OSPF on the \\nrouter interfaces of R1 and R2, using   the show ip ospf interface brief  command.\\nExample 11-5 show ip interface brief  on R1 and R2\\nR1> show ip ospf interface brief\\nInterface    PID   Area IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C\\nGi0/1 1     0 10.1.11.1/24 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/0 1     0 10.1.1.1/24 1     DROTH 2/2\\n!

The \\nshow ip ospf interface  command, not shown in the example, lists detailed OSPF informa-\\ntion for each interface.\\nSpecific to this problem, the output in Example 11-5 shows that R1 and R2 both have OSPF \\nenabled on both LAN interfaces. However, this command also lists the area number for each interface, with R2 having both LAN interfaces in area 1. Also, these commands repeat the IP address and mask of the interfaces, so together, you can see that R1’s 10.1.1.1/24 address is in the same subnet as R2’s 10.1.1.2/24 address, putting these two routers in the same subnet but in different OSPF areas.\\nExample 11-6 shows another way to look at the problem, with the \\nshow ip protocols  \\ncommands on both R1 and R2. Because this command lists the OSPF network  commands \\nin shorthand form, it can point toward a possible configuration error, even if the        configura-\\ntion is not available.\\nExample 11-6 Finding OSPF Configuration Errors with show ip protocols  R1 and R2\\nR1> show ip protocols\\n*** IP Routing is NSF aware ***\\nRouting Protocol is \"ospf 1\"\\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Router ID 1.1.1.1\\n  Number of areas in this router is 1. 1 normal 0 stub 0 nssa\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n    2.2.2.2 110 00:14:32\\n    3.3.3.3 110 00:14:32\\n    10.1.44.4 110 00:14:42\\n  Distance: (default is 110)\\nR1> show ip route ospf\\n!

As usual, the section with the head-\\ning “Routing for Networks:” points to a shorthand version of the configuration. In     this case, the highlighted phrase “10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 1” is actually the exact syntax of the one \\nnetwork  command on Router R2, minus the word network , or network 10.0.0.0 \\n0.255.255.255 area 1 . Because Figure 11-4 shows the design should put all interfaces in \\narea 0, reconfiguring this command to instead be network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area \\n0 would solve this particular problem.\\nThe end of the example also shows     an unsolicited log message generated by Router R2, notifying the console user that this router has received a Hello from a router in a different area.\\nAs you check the interfaces, you could also check several other details. It makes sense to go \\nahead and check the interface IP addresses, masks, and      interface status values by using the \\nshow interfaces  and show ip interface brief  commands. In particular, it is helpful to note \\nwhich interfaces are up/up, because a router will send no packets (including routing proto-col packets) out interfaces that are not in an up/up state. These interface verification checks are    part of the IPv4 troubleshooting topics in both the ICND1 and ICND2 exam topics, and are discussed in Chapter 21, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing,” so they are not repeated here.\\nptg17396363284  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNeighbor Relationships\\nThis final major section of the chapter examines the large number of facts that each router \\nmust check with each potential neighbor before the two routers become neighbors.\\nAt a very basic level, routing protocols can easily create neighbor relationships using a Hello \\nprotocol. First, the routing protocol must be enabled on an interface. In addition, the inter-face may not be configured as a passive interface, because that stops the routing protocol from sending the Hello messages.\\nBeyond this basic process, the routing protocols   actually check several other parameters to \\nfind out whether the routers should become neighbors. Both OSPF and EIGRP use Hello messages, and these messages each list information used to perform some basic verifica-tion checks. For example, as just shown in earlier Example 11-5, an OSPF router should not become neighbors with another router in another area because all routers on a common subnet should be in the same OSPF area by design.\\nAfter an EIGRP or OSPF router hears a Hello from a new neighbor, the routing protocol \\nexamines the information in the Hello, and compares that information with the local rout-er’s own settings. If the settings match, great. If not, the routers do not become neighbors. Because there is no formal term for all these items that a routing protocol considers, this book just calls      them \\nneighbor requirements .\\nTable 11-2 lists the neighbor requirements for both EIGRP and OSPF. Following the table, the next few pages examine some of these settings for both EIGRP and OSPF, again using examples based on Figure 11-3.\\nNOTE Even though it is important to study and remember the items in this table, when reading this chapter the first time, just keep reading. When later reviewing the chapter or part, make sure you remember the details in the table.\\nTable 11-2 Neighbor Requirements for EIGRP and OSPF\\nRequirement EIGRP OSPF\\nInterfaces must be in an up/up state.

N/A Y es\\n1 Having duplicate EIGRP RIDs does not prevent routers from becoming neighbors, but it can cause prob-\\nlems when external EIGRP routes are added to the routing table.\\nUnlike most of the neighbor requirements listed in Table 11-2, the first three requirements \\nhave very little to do with the routing protocols      themselves. The two routers must be able to send packets to each other over the physical network to which they are both connected. \\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  285\\nTo do that, the router interfaces must be up/up, and they must be in the same subnet. In \\naddition, the routers must not be using an ACL that filters the routing protocol traffic.\\nFor instance, OSPF sends many messages to the well-known multicast IP addresses 224.0.0.5 \\nand 224.0.0.6, whereas EIGRP uses 224.0.0.10. An ACL command like access-list 101 \\ndeny ip any host 224.0.0.10 , in an inbound ACL on a router interface, would filter \\nincoming EIGRP packets. Or, an ACL command like access-list 102 deny ospf any any  \\ncould filter all OSPF traffic. Even more difficult to notice is an ACL that has lots of permit  \\ncommands that match different TCP and UDP port numbers, but does not match the rout-ing protocol explicitly, so the routing protocol packets match the implicit deny any at the end of the ACL. So, take extra care to watch for ACLs, especially when it seems like all the routing protocol configuration looks good.\\nIn practice, before examining the rest of the    details of why two routers do not become \\nneighbors, confirm that the two routers can ping each other on the local subnet. If the ping fails, investigate all the Layer 1, 2, and 3 issues that could prevent the ping from working (such as an interface not being up/up). The details of troubleshooting IPv4 routing (that is, packet forwarding) can be found in several places, including Chapter 21, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing.” Additionally, the ICND1 Cert Guide includes other related details, including a chapter about IPv4 troubleshooting tools such as ping and traceroute; that ICND1 chapter is made available to you in this ICND2 book as a DVD Appendix J, “IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools.”\\nNow, on to the specific discussions about EIGRP and OSPF. Because the details differ slightly \\nbetween the two routing protocols, this section first examines EIGRP, followed by OSPF.\\nNOTE This section assumes that the routing protocol has actually been enabled on each required interface, as covered earlier in this chapter in the “Interfaces Enabled with a Routing Protocol” section.\\nEIGRP Neighbor Verification Checks\\nAny two EIGRP routers that     connect to the same data link, and whose interfaces have been enabled for EIGRP and are not passive, will at least consider becoming neighbors. To quick-ly and definitively know which potential neighbors have passed all the neighbor require-ments for EIGRP, just look at the output of the \\nshow ip eigrp neighbors  command. This \\ncommand lists only neighbors that have passed all the neighbor verification checks.\\nExample 11-7 shows an example of the show ip eigrp neighbors  command, with the four \\nrouters from Figure 11-3 again. In this case, all the routers have been configured correctly, \\nso each has a neighbor relationship with the other three routers   on the same LAN subnet.\\nExample 11-7 R1 show ip eigrp  neighbors  Command with All Problems Fixed\\nR1# show ip eigrp neighbors\\nEIGRP-IPv4 Neighbors for AS(99)\\nH   Address                 Interface Hold Uptime   SRTT   RTO  Q  Seq\\n(sec) (ms) Cnt Num\\n1   10.1.1.3 Gi0/0 13 00:00:20    1   100  0  31\\n2   10.1.1.4 Gi0/0 13 00:00:43   80   480  0  10\\n0   10.1.1.2 Gi0/0 13 00:13:52    1   100  0  20\\nptg17396363286  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIf the show ip eigrp neighbors  command does not list one or more expected neighbors, \\nthe first problem isolation step should be to find out if the two routers can ping each oth-\\ner’s IP addresses on the same subnet. If that works, start looking at the list of neighbor veri-fication checks, as relisted for EIGRP here in Table 11-3. Table 11-3 summarizes the EIGRP neighbor requirements, while noting the best commands with which to determine which    requirement is the root cause of the problem.\\nTable 11-3 EIGRP Neighbor Requirements and the Best show/\\ndebug  Commands\\nRequirement Best Commands to Isolate the Problem\\nMust be in the same subnet. show interfaces , show ip interface     \\nMust use the same ASN on the router  \\nconfiguration command.show ip eigrp interfaces , show ip protocols     \\nMust pass EIGRP neighbor authentication. debug eigrp packets   \\nK-values must match. show ip protocols   \\nOf the four rows of requirements listed in Table 11-3, the first two have already been dis-cussed in this chapter, and do not need further discussion. \\nFor EIGRP authentication (the third item in the table), EIGRP supports the capability for \\nrouters to trust routers as EIGRP neighbors only if the routers share the same security key (password); if that check fails, the neighbor relationship fails. By default, routers   do not attempt EIGRP authentication, which allows the routers to form EIGRP neighbor relation-ships. If one router uses authentication, and the other does not, they will not become neighbors. If both use authentication, they must use the same authentication key to become neighbors.\\nThe last item in the table, EIGRP K-values, refers to the EIGRP metric components and the \\nmetric calculation. These K-values are   variables that basically enable or disable the use of the different components in the EIGRP composite metric. Cisco recommends leaving these values at their default settings, using only bandwidth and delay in the metric calculation. The K-value settings must match before two routers will become neighbors; you can     check the K-values on both routers with the \\nshow ip protocols  command.\\nEIGRP Neighbor Troubleshooting Example\\nExample 11-8 shows three problems that can cause EIGRP routers to fail to become neigh-bors. This example uses the usual design for this chapter, as repeated in Figure 11-5. The figure shows the same routers, and same interfaces, but    with the following problems:\\n■R2 has been configured with IP address 10.1.2.2/24 in a different subnet than R1, R3,\\nand R4.\\n■R3 has been configured to use ASN 199 with the router eigrp 199  command instead of\\nASN 99, as used on the other three routers.\\n■R4 has been configured to use message digest 5 (MD5) authentication, whereas the other\\nrouters use no authentication.\\nR1 can actually detect two of the problems using local commands and messages, as shown in Example 11-8. R1 generates an unsolicited log message for the mismatched subnet prob-lem, and a \\ndebug  command on R1 can reveal the       authentication failure. The example shows \\nsome running commentary inside the example.\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  287\\nG0/0G0/0 G0/1\\nG0/110.1.1.1/24 10.1.11.1/24\\n10.1.22.2/24 10.1.2.2/24R1\\nR2\\nWrong Subnet Uses Authentication\\n(Others Do Not)Wrong ASN (199)\\nG0/1G0/0\\nG0/0G0/1\\n10.1.44.4/2410.1.1.4/2410.1.1.3/2410.1.33.3/24R3\\nR4\\nFigure 11-5 Summary of Problems That Prevent EIGRP Neighbors on the Central LAN\\nExample 11-8 Common Problems Preventing the Formation of EIGRP Neighbors (R1)\\n!

Note that the ICND2 200-105 and CCNA 200-125 exam topics specifically state that both OSPF and EIGRP authentication are excluded from the exam topics. However, even without knowing the details, it is easy to imagine that if one router’s EIGRP process uses authentication with a defined password, and the other does not, that authentication    will fail. The result? Neighbor relationships do not form. \\nExample 11-8 shows details about two of the problems, but not any details about the incor-\\nrect ASN configured on R3. Example 11-9 shows those details by listing excerpts from two \\nptg17396363288  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nshow  commands on R3, both of which identify the ASN configured on that router. By \\nusing these same commands on all the routers, you could note that R1, R2, and R4 use ASN \\n99, whereas      R3 uses 199, as shown in Example 11-9.\\nExample 11-9 Displaying the Incorrect ASN (199) on R3\\nR3# show ip protocols\\nRouting Protocol is \"eigrp 199\"\\n!\\n!

So, the first step in troubleshooting OSPF neighbors is to look at the list of neighbors.\\nExample 11-10 lists the output of a show ip ospf neighbor  command on Router R2, from \\nFigure 11-4. All four routers sit on the same LAN subnet, in area 0, with correct configura-\\ntions, so all four routers form a valid OSPF neighbor relationship.\\nExample 11-10 Normal Working show ip ospf neighbors Command on Router R2\\nR2# show ip ospf neighbor\\nNeighbor ID     Pri   State Dead Time   Address Interface\\n1.1.1.1 1   FULL/BDR 00:00:37    10.1.1.1 GigabitEthernet0/0\\n3.3.3.3 1   2WAY/DROTHER    00:00:37    10.1.1.3 GigabitEthernet0/0\\n4.4.4.4 1   FULL/DR 00:00:31    10.1.1.4 GigabitEthernet0/0\\nFirst, note that the neighbor IDs, listed in the first column, identify neighbors by their rout-\\ner ID (RID). For this example network, all four routers use an easily guessed RID. Further to the right, the Address column lists the interface IP address used by that neighbor on the common subnet.\\nA brief review of OSPF neighbor states     (as explained in Chapter 7) can help you understand \\na few of the subtleties of the output in the example. A router’s listed status for each of its OSPF neighbors—the neighbor’s state—should settle into either a 2-way or full state under normal operation. For neighbors that do not need to directly exchange their databases, typically two non-designated router (DR) routers on a LAN, the routers should settle into \\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  289\\na 2-way neighbor state. In most cases, two neighboring routers need to directly exchange \\ntheir full link-state databases (LSDB) with each other. As soon as that process has been com-pleted, the two routers settle into a full neighbor state.\\nIn Example 11-10, Router R4 is the DR, and R1 is the backup DR (BDR), so R2 and R3 (as \\nnon-DRs) do not need to directly exchange routes. Therefore, R2’s neighbor state for R3 (RID 3.3.3.3) in Example 11-10 is listed as 2-way.\\nNOTE Notably, OSPF neighbors do not have to use the same process ID on the \\nrouter \\nospf  process-id  command to become neighbors. In Example 11-10, all four routers use \\ndifferent PIDs.\\nIf the show ip ospf neighbor  command does not list one or more expected neighbors, \\nyou should confirm, even before moving on to look at OSPF neighbor requirements, that the two routers can ping each other on the local subnet. But if the two neighboring routers can ping each other, and the two routers still do not become OSPF neighbors, the next step is to examine each of the OSPF neighbor requirements.

This command lists messages related to OSPF neighbor adjacency \\nevents, and   shows messages that identify the area mismatch (with R2).\\nExample 11-11 Finding Mismatched Area Problem with R1 debug\\nR1# debug ip ospf adj\\nOSPF adjacency events debugging is on\\nR1#\\n*Nov 15 13:42:02.288: OSPF-1 ADJ   Gi0/0: Rcv pkt from 10.1.1.2, area 0.0.0.0, \\n  mismatched area 0.0.0.1 in the header\\nR1#\\nR1# undebug all\\nAll possible debugging has been turned off\\nAs noted in Table 11-4, the debug ip ospf adj  command helps   troubleshoot mismatched \\nOSPF area problems. The first part of the highlighted message in the example lists short-\\nhand about a received packet (“Rcv pkt”) from 10.1.1.2, which is R2’s IP address. The rest of the message mentions R1’s area (0.0.0.0), and the area claimed by the other router (0.0.0.1). (Note that the message lists the 32-bit area number as a dotted-decimal number.)\\nThis particular example focuses on the symptom (that a neighbor relationship does not \\nstart), and the debug messages that identify the problem (mismatched areas). However, find-ing the configuration error may take some work, because the problem could be more com-plex    than just having the wrong area number configured on a command.\\nOne harder-to-notice configuration error happens when the configuration has multiple \\nnetwork  commands, with different area numbers, that all happen to match one interface’s \\nIP address. IOS stores the OSPF network  commands to the configuration in the same order \\nthey are configured (which is the same order listed in the output of show running-config ). \\nIOS processes the commands in sequence, so that the first network  command that matches \\na particular interface is used to set the OSPF area number.\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  291\\nFor instance, imagine a router with interface G0/1 configured with IP address 1.1.1.1. The \\nOSPF configuration lists the following two network  commands, in that order. Both would \\nmatch the interface IP address of 1.1.1.1, so IOS uses the first command, which lists area 1. IOS would not use the second command, even though it uses a wildcard mask that is more specific.\\n■network 1.0.0.0  0.255.255.255 area 1\\n■network 1.1.1.1  0.0.0.0 area 0\\nAnother tricky configuration error that can result in an area mismatch occurs when config-uring both the \\nnetwork  OSPF subcommand and the ip ospf  interface subcommand on the \\nsame router. IOS supports using both on the same router at the same time. However, IOS does not prevent a case in which a \\nnetwork  command attempts to enable OSPF in one area, \\nand the ip ospf  interface subcommand attempts to enable OSPF in a different area. When \\nthat happens, IOS uses the area number defined in the ip ospf  interface subcommand. \\nFor instance, with the two network  commands just listed, if the ip ospf 1 area 5  com-\\nmand was configured on that router’s interface, that interface would      be in area 5; IOS would prefer that setting over any OSPF \\nnetwork  command.\\nNOTE Using both network  router subcommands and ip ospf  interface subcommands \\nallows an easier migration from the older to newer style OSPF configuration. However, most enterprises today would use either \\nnetwork  commands or ip ospf  commands in one \\nrouter.\\nFinding Duplicate OSPF Router IDs\\nNext, Example 11-12 shows R1 and R3 both trying      to use RID 1.1.1.1. Interestingly, both routers automatically generate a log message for the duplicate OSPF RID problem between R1 and R3; the end of Example 11-12 shows one such message. For the exams, just use the \\nshow ip ospf  commands   on both R3 and R1 to easily list the RID on each router, noting \\nthat they both use the same value.\\nExample 11-12 Comparing OSPF Router IDs on R1 and R3\\n!

The first line of the show ip ospf  com-\\nmand on the two routers quickly shows the duplicate use of 1.1.1.1. To solve the problem, \\nassuming R1 should use 1.1.1.1 and R3 should use another RID (maybe 3.3.3.3), change the RID on R3, and restart the OSPF process. To do so, use the \\nrouter-id 3.3.3.3  OSPF sub-\\ncommand and use the EXEC mode command clear ip ospf process .\\nAlso, take a moment to read over the log message generated on each router when a dupli-cate RID exists.\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  293\\nFinally, note that the show ip ospf  commands in Example 11-12 also show a common \\nfalse positive for a root cause of OSPF neighbor problems. OSPF PIDs—the number of the \\nrouter ospf  command—do not have to match. Note that in Example 11-12 that same first \\nline of output shows that R3 uses the router ospf 3  command, per the phrase “Process \\nospf 3,” whereas R1 uses the router ospf 1  command, as noted with the phrase “Process \\nospf 1.” These         mismatched numbers are not a problem.\\nFinding OSPF Hello and Dead Timer Mismatches\\nFinally, consider the problem created on R4, with the        configuration of a different Hello \\ntimer and dead timer as compared with the default settings on R1, R2, and R3. Whereas EIGRP allows neighbors to use a different Hello timer, OSPF does not, so this mismatch prevents R4 from becoming neighbors with any of the other three OSPF routers.\\nExample 11-13 shows the easiest way to find the mismatch, using the \\nshow ip ospf \\ninterface  command on both R1 and R4. This command lists    the Hello and dead timers for \\neach interface, as highlighted in the example. Note that R1 uses 10 and 40 (Hello and dead), \\nwhereas R4 uses 5 and 20.\\nExample 11-13 Finding Mismatched Hello/Dead Timers\\nR1# show ip ospf interface G0/0\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Internet Address 10.1.1.1/24, Area 0, Attached via Network Statement\\n  Process ID 1, Router ID 1.1.1.1, Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1\\n  Topology-MTID    Cost    Disabled    Shutdown Topology Name\\n0 1 no no Base\\n  Transmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1\\n  Designated Router (ID) 1.1.1.1, Interface address 10.1.1.1\\n  No backup designated router on this network  Timer intervals configured, Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40, Retransmit 5\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\n!

The highlighted message uses a C to mean “config-\\nured value”—in other words, the value on the local router, or R1 in this case. The R in the \\nmessage means “received value,” or the value listed in the received Hello. In this case\\n■“Dead R 20 C 40” means that R1 received a Hello with a dead timer set to 20, while R1’s\\nconfigured value is set to 40.\\n■“Hello R 5 C 10” means that R1 received a Hello with        the Hello timer set to 5, while R1’s\\nconfigured value is set to 10.\\nNote that any IP subnet mismatch problems could also be found    with this same debug, based on the received and configured subnet masks.\\nOther OSPF Issues\\nThis last short discussion in this chapter looks at these two additional topics: shutting down the routing protocol process and the interface maximum transmission unit (MTU) size.\\nShutting Down the OSPF Process\\nCisco uses the IOS shutdown  command       in several contexts. You can use the shutdown  \\ncommand in interface configuration mode to disable the interface so that it no longer sends and receives packets. Cisco IOS switches allow the \\nshutdown  command in VLAN configu-\\nration mode, causing the switch to stop forwarding frames in that VLAN. In both cases, the \\nshutdown  command does not remove any configuration; it simply causes IOS to stop a par-\\nticular function. Then, the no shutdown  command   in the same command mode re-enables \\nthat function.\\nIOS allows both the OSPFv2 and EIGRP routing protocol processes to be disabled and \\nenabled with the shutdown  and no shutdown  commands, respectively, in routing protocol \\nconfiguration mode. When a routing protocol process is shut down, IOS\\n■Brings down any existing neighbor relationships\\n■Does not form new neighbor relationships\\n■Quits sending Hello messages\\n■Does not remove routing protocol configuration\\nBasically, shutting down the routing protocol process gives the network engineer a way to stop using the routing protocol on that router, without having to remove all the configura-tion.\\nptg1739636311Chapter 11: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols  295\\nFrom a troubleshooting perspective, on the exam, what would you expect to see if a small \\ndesign was configured perfectly, except that one router’s OSPF process was shut down? First, the router with the shutdown routing protocol process would not have any OSPF neighbors, and other routers would not list that router as a neighbor. But because the OSPF \\nshutdown  subcommand does not remove any configuration, the show ip ospf interfaces  \\ncommand still shows evidence that OSPF is configured on the interfaces.\\nExample 11-15 shows an example on Router R5, as shown in Figure 11-7. R5 is a differ-\\nent router than the one used in earlier examples, but it begins the example with two OSPF neighbors, R2 and R3, with router IDs 2.2.2.2 and 3.3.3.3. The example     shows the OSPF process being shut down, the neighbors failing, and those two key OSPF \\nshow      commands: \\nshow ip ospf neighbor  and show ip ospf interface brief . \\nRID 2.2.2.2\\n10.1.12.1\\n10.1.13.1R5R2\\nR3RID 3.3.3.3G0/1\\nG0/2\\nFigure 11-7 Example Network to Demonstrate OSPF Process Shutdown\\nExample 11-15 Shutting Down an OSPF Process, and the Resulting Neighbor States\\nR5# show ip ospf neighbor\\nNeighbor ID     Pri   State Dead Time   Address Interface\\n2.2.2.2 1   FULL/DR 00:00:35    10.1.12.2 GigabitEthernet0/1\\n3.3.3.3 1   FULL/DR 00:00:33    10.1.13.3 GigabitEthernet0/2\\nR5# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

First, \\nbefore the shutdown , the show ip ospf neighbor  command lists two neighbors. After \\nthe shutdown , the same command lists no neighbors at all. Second, the show ip ospf \\ninterface brief  command does list the interfaces on which OSPF is enabled, on the local \\nrouter’s own IP addresses. However, it lists a state of DOWN, which is a reference to the \\n    neighbor’s state. \\nMismatched MTU Settings\\nThe MTU size defines a per-interface    setting used by the router for its Layer 3 forwarding logic, defining the largest network layer packet that the router will forward out each inter-face. For instance, the IPv4 MTU size of an interface defines the maximum size IPv4 packet that the router can forward out an interface.\\nRouters often use a default MTU size of 1500 bytes, with the ability to set the value as well. \\nThe \\nip mtu  size  interface   subcommand defines the IPv4 MTU setting, and the ipv6 mtu  \\nsize  command sets the equivalent for IPv6 packets.\\nIn an odd twist, two OSPFv2 routers can actually become OSPF neighbors, and reach 2-way state, even if they happen to use different IPv4 MTU settings on their interfaces. However, they fail to exchange their LSDBs. Eventually, after trying and failing to exchange their LSDBs, the neighbor relationship also fails.\\nThe concepts behind what happens with an MTU mismatch work the same with both \\nOSPFv2 and OSPFv3. In Chapter 23, “Implementing OSPF for IPv6,” the “The Issue of IPv6 MTU” section shows an example of this particular problem with OSPFv3. Read that section for a little more detail about this issue.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

In the past, BGP might get a mention as the one current routing protocol used to exchange routes between companies (called autonomous systems for the purposes of BGP). Now for the first time in the history of the Cisco CCNA R&S the exam topics include BGP configuration and verification topics.\\nHowever, the lone BGP exam topic encompasses only one small slice of BGP, which limits \\nthe BGP discussion to this single chapter. BGP is a long-lived and flexible protocol, one that has many core features, with many features added to it over the years.

To begin exploring BGP—the only option for an    exterior gateway pro-tocol (EGP) in use today—this section begins by making some basic comparisons between IGPs and EGPs.\\nSo, ignoring the details of how the individual protocols work, instead focusing on what \\nthey do, what do IGPs like RIPv2, OSPF, and EIGRP accomplish? This       list summarizes the main points:\\nLearn routes: Learn about subnets/masks, and calculate the local router’s route for that \\nsubnet, with outgoing interface and next-hop router\\nChoose the best route: If one routing protocol learns of multiple routes existing for a \\nsingle subnet, pick the best route, using some kind of metric\\nConverge: When network changes happen, converge—either remove routes, add new \\nones, or replace a failed route with a working route\\nRIPv2, OSPF, and EIGRP differ mostly in the mechanics of how they go about achieving \\nthe goals in this list. That is, each IGP needs     to learn about new subnets and use metrics to choose the best route among competing routes for each subnet, and to converge as quickly as possible. \\nBGP has these same design goals, but with a much different emphasis compared to IGPs. \\nFirst and foremost, BGP focuses on the first item in the list, called    \\nreachability  in BGP \\nterms. What prefixes (address blocks) are reachable? BGP, intended for use throughout the global Internet, must scale. And the first job—the most important job—is to make sure all routers learn about all public IP address prefixes reachable in the Internet.\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  303\\nJust to give you a sense of the scale of the     IP routing tables used in the Internet core rout-\\ners, check out the website http://bgp.potaroo.net, a site by Geoff Huston, who has been publishing statistics about the Internet for several decades. A check of this website while writing this chapter showed that the size of the BGP table in the Internet—which indicates the number of IPv4 routes expected to be in those routers—is at just over 600,000 entries. BGP has a big job to do.\\nAdvertising Routes with BGP\\nBGP exchanges routing information     by using the same general process used by IGPs, but with some differences of course. To begin the BGP process, one router must have knowl-edge of some IPv4 prefix. It then uses a BGP protocol message (a BGP \\nupdate  message) to \\nexchange the routing information with another router, as shown in Figure 12-1. With BGP, the other router is called     a \\nBGP neighbor  or BGP peer . \\nASN 1001 ASN 1 ASN 2 ASN 3\\nBGP192.0.2.0/24Enterprise ISP1 ISP2 ISP3\\nBGP192.0.2.0/24 192.0.2.0/24\\nBGP\\nFigure 12-1 Using BGP Between Autonomous Systems\\nOne big difference with BGP compared to IGPs is that BGP advertises the routes to other routers in other companies, shown     in the figure as other ISPs. IGPs, by definition, advertise routes to other routers inside the same company.\\nNOTE While IGPs advertise blocks   of addresses that we generally refer to as \\nsubnets , \\nwith BGP, we refer to the blocks of addresses as either prefixes , address blocks , or even      \\nthe formal BGP name, Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). The reason for \\nnot using the word subnet is that, in practice, BGP seldom advertises address blocks as small as an individual subnet. \\nBGP differs from IGPs in its purpose, including the fact that, for an enterprise, BGP can be used to advertise the enterprise’s public IPv4 prefix to its local ISP. In Figure 12-1, the enterprise sits on the far left, with a BGP peering relationship to the enterprise’s ISP (ISP1 in this case). The enterprise then advertises its public prefix, Class C network 192.0.2.0/24, into ISP1. To create the global Internet, ISPs connect to each other, so ISP1 then advertises this prefix (192.0.2.0/24) to the other ISPs as shown, so that all parts of the Internet know how to forward packets to addresses in 192.0.2.0/24.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B, D 2 C 3 B, D 4 A 5 D 6 A, D\\nptg17396363304  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe term autonomous system number  (ASN) plays    a key role in BGP, even more so than \\nit does within EIGRP. With BGP, as with EIGRP, the term autonomous system  (AS) refers    \\nto a network that operates separately from other networks (that is, autonomously). BGP \\nuses the ASN—the number that identifies each AS—for many BGP features, including a part of the best path selection process (to choose the best BGP route). The ASN is also used     as part of a routing loop prevention mechanism. \\nInternal and External BGP\\nThe one BGP exam topic uses the acronym eBGP, rather than simply BGP. eBGP refers to \\nExternal BGP , used in         contrast to Internal BGP  (iBGP). To see what those terms mean, \\nyou need to think in a little more detail about what happens with BGP update messages.\\nWhen an enterprise connects to an ISP, the physical connection is chosen to be as short as is \\nreasonably possible, on purpose. For instance, in Figure 12-2, enterprise Router R1 and ISP1 Router ISP1-1 may sit in the same city; in fact, ISPs build their networks to place   points of presence (PoP) near their customers, so that the WAN link from the customer to the ISP is short. \\niBGP\\neBGP\\niBGPeBGP\\neBGPEnterprise ISP1 ISP2\\nISP3ISP1-1 R1ISP1-2\\nISP1-3ISP2-1\\nISP3-1\\nASN 1001 ASN 1ASN 2\\nASN 3\\nFigure 12-2 eBGP Versus iBGP\\nTo create the global Internet, ISPs connect to each other. Some ISPs may be regional, or \\ncover one country. Some cover major geographies of the world (for example, Europe), or a few may cover most of the globe. However, ISP1’s sites may span the entire country, conti-nent, or globe. ISP2 and ISP3 have different locations, in different geographies as well. To physically create the Internet, by connecting all ISPs to other ISPs in some way, the ISPs connect their routers someplace in the world. In fact, ISPs often co-locate routers in the same room, called an Internet exchange, for high-speed connections between ISPs.\\nNow think about BGP as used to exchange routes across enterprises, to their ISPs, and \\nbetween all the ISPs, with the ISPs spread across major geographical regions. For BGP to work for the global Internet, BGP must first exchange prefix information between ASNs (External BGP). However, to then be able to advertise prefixes out other links in other parts of an ISP’s network, the ISP must advertise those prefixes to other routers inside the same ASN (Internal BGP), as shown in the center of Figure 12-2.\\nBasically, eBGP refers to BGP’s use in advertising routes between two different ASNs. iBGP \\nrefers to using BGP to advertise routes to other routers inside the same ASN. BGP uses slightly different rules and details of what it advertises and how it works         based on whether a neighbor is an eBGP or iBGP peer. This chapter deals with eBGP only.\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  305\\nChoosing the Best Routes with BGP\\nThe beginning of this chapter stated that all routing protocols learn prefixes, choose the \\nbest route if multiple routes exist, and converge when the network changes. BGP focuses on that first action—advertising reachability for a prefix. Additionally, like the IGPs, BGP has a concept like a metric, so that BGP can choose the best route among competing routes. However, BGP uses a much different approach      to defining a metric and a different approach to the logic BGP uses to determine the best route. \\nFirst, BGP does not use a single idea of a metric. Instead, it uses \\npath attributes . BGP \\nadvertises each prefix along with a list of different path attributes. The path attributes are \\ndifferent facts about the route (path) to reach that subnet. By using multiple concepts (mul-tiple path attributes), BGP allows for a much wider variety of decisions about which route is best.\\nBGP then uses a process called the \\nbest path selection  process to choose the best route \\nbetween two competing routes. When receiving a BGP update that lists a prefix that already \\nexists, the router has a simple choice to make: Is the old route better, or is this new one bet-ter? The best path selection process works through a series of comparisons (about ten) until a comparison shows one of the routes as being better. Understanding the process requires a detailed understanding of the path attributes by the network engineer (and is beyond the scope of this chapter). However, BGP on the routers requires very little work to make the comparisons, much less than, say, OSPF’s SPF process, so the BGP best path selection pro-cess scales well.\\nWhile that general description of best path selection is accurate, a single example can help. \\nBGP uses the AS_Path path attribute (PA) in one step of the best path selection process. AS_Path is a path attribute sent with routes in BGP, and this attribute lists the ASNs in the route. The best path selection process considers a shorter AS_Path as better; you can think of it a little like a hop count, but the hops are entire ASNs rather than single routers.\\nFigure 12-3 shows an example with two competing routes to reach prefix 192.0.2.0/24, one \\nwith a shorter AS_Path length. The enterprise advertises its public prefix 192.0.2.0/24 to ISP1, which then advertises it to other ISPs. ISP3 eventually learns two possible routes to that prefix, one that lists an AS_Path with three ASNs, and the shorter one with two ASNs (the best path, as noted with the >). \\nEnterprise\\n192.0.2.0/24ASN 1001ISP1\\nASN 1ISP2\\nASN 2\\nISP3\\n Prefix\\n 192.0.2.0/24\\n> 192.0.2.0/24eBGPeBGP eBGP\\neBGP\\nAS_Path\\n2-1-1001\\n1-1001ASN 3\\nFigure 12-3 ASNs and Shortest AS_Path as Chosen at ISP3 for Prefix 192.0.2.0/24\\nptg17396363306  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIf you continue down the routing and switching      track in your Cisco studies, you will learn \\nmore and more about BGP and the best path algorithm. Both CCNP ROUTE and CCIE R&S include many details of BGP.\\neBGP and the Internet Edge\\nThe term Internet edge  refers     to the connection between an ISP customer and an ISP. The \\none BGP exam topic focuses the BGP discussion on the Internet edge, specifically the eBGP peering between an enterprise and an ISP, and what BGP can usefully do at the edge. \\nInternet Edge Designs and Terminology\\nThe term single homed  (used in the one BGP exam topic) refers to a particular Internet \\nedge design with a single link       to one ISP, as shown in Figure 12-4. A single-homed design has a single link between the enterprise and an ISP. You would typically find a single-homed Internet edge design used when connecting an enterprise branch office to the Internet, or for a simple connection from a core site at the enterprise.\\nEnterprise ISPSingle Homed\\nFigure 12-4 Single-Homed Design: Single Link, One Home (ISP)\\nA single-homed design allows any kind of WAN link. That is, it could be DSL, cable, fiber Ethernet, or even a wireless LTE connection. The more important points are that the enter-prise site connects to a single ISP, and that only one link exists to that ISP. Figure 12-5 expands upon those concepts.\\nEnterprise\\nNetworkISP\\nNetworkAny WAN ConnectionSingle: 1 Link Homed: 1 ISP\\n(DSL, Cable, LTE, Serial, MPLS) R1 R2\\nFigure 12-5 Any Physical Link in Single-Homed Internet Edge\\nA single-homed connection has some  pros and cons. With only a single link, if the link fails, the ability to reach the Internet fails as well. A failure on either of the routers on the ends of the links also causes the Internet connection to fail. Of course, a single Internet connec-tion, versus multiple, saves money.\\nOther Internet edge designs do exist, of course, mostly adding redundancy, increasing \\ncapacity, and raising the cost and complexity. Figure 12-6 shows three similar designs, in growing levels of complexity. Note that the designs with  \\ndual  in the name refer to designs \\nwith two (or more) links to the same router, while  multihomed  refers to having connec-\\ntions to multiple ISPs.\\nYou need basic BGP skills only to understand what happens in single-homed and dual-\\nhomed designs—in fact, this chapter focuses mostly on the needs of the single-homed designs, with some extra information useful to dual-homed designs. The added redundancy of the different multihomed designs requires a much deeper understanding of BGP      con-cepts, path attributes, best path selection, and configuration. \\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  307\\nEnterprise ISPDual Homed\\nEnterprise ISP1Single Multihomed\\nISP2\\nEnterprise ISP1Dual Multihomed\\nISP2\\nFigure 12-6 Different Internet Edge Designs\\nNOTE The one CCNA R&S exam topic limits BGP specifically to eBGP and to single-\\nhomed designs. Frankly, the enterprises that use a single-homed Internet connection often do not even bother to use eBGP, often using static routing instead. However, BGP has many rules and configuration options. Cisco’s limits on the BGP exam topic gives CCNA candi-dates a chance to begin learning a little about BGP, but in a limited way that avoids most of BGP’s complexity. \\nAdvertising the Enterprise Public Prefix into the Internet\\nNext, consider what routes should be advertised      between two eBGP peers at the Internet edge. Begin with routes advertised by the enterprise to the ISP, as with a typical enterprise site on the left side of Figure 12-7. In that particular design, the enterprise uses\\nPrivate 10.0.0.0/8: Like many companies, this enterprise uses private IP network 10.0.0.0 \\nfor most hosts in the enterprise.\\nPublic 192.0.2.0/24: The public IPv4 network assigned to the company. As shown, it has \\nbeen subnetted, one subnet for use with NAT, the other used for a DMZ with public-facing web servers.\\nptg17396363308  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\neBGP192.0.2.0/24R1 ISP110.0.0.0/8\\nFW1\\nDMZ\\n192.0.2.128/26192.0.2.0/29\\nLoopback1NAT\\nFigure 12-7 Public and Private IPv4 Address Prefixes Advertised to an ISP\\nWorking through the public addressing in a little more detail, the enterprise uses public IP \\nnetwork 192.0.2.0/24. It uses a NAT configuration on the router, with subnet 192.0.2.0/29 configured on a loopback interface, ready for use by NAT. The design also includes a security demilitarized zone (DMZ), where public-facing servers, such as public web servers, can reside. These hosts also use some of the enterprise’s public address range, from subnet 192.0.2.128/26 in this case.\\nNote that over the eBGP connection from R1 to ISP1, R1 advertises only one route: a route \\nfor public address prefix 192.0.2.0/24. Private IP networks should never be advertised into the Internet; the ISP would filter that advertisement anyway. For the public address range, the ISP wants to receive one route for each public address block, rather than hearing about each subnet, because the ISP does not care how the enterprise subnets the network. Figure 12-7 shows the one prefix the enterprise would normally advertise to the ISP in an eBGP update.\\nWhy advertise the enterprise’s public prefix to the ISP at all? So that the ISP can then adver-\\ntise the prefix to other ISPs, and eventually all ISPs have a route to deliver packets to the enterprise’s public IP address. Figure 12-8 shows the idea. At Step 1, R1, in the enterprise, uses eBGP to advertise its public IPv4 prefix to ISP1. At Step 2, ISP1 advertises      that same prefix to two different ISPs. \\nEnterprise\\nISP3ISP2\\n192.0.2.0/24ISP1\\nR1 ISP1\\n12\\neBGPeBGP\\n2eBGP\\nFigure 12-8 Enterprise Advertises the Public Prefix; ISP Propagates\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  309\\nLearning Default Routes from the ISP\\nNow turn the logic around, and think about what the ISP can and should advertise with \\neBGP to the enterprise. The Internet core       routers have almost 600,000 IPv4 routes. An enterprise router at the Internet edge could learn all those routes from the ISP, and put those in its IPv4 routing table. Then, through a process called  \\nredistribution , that router \\ncould take all those BGP-learned routes and advertise them into the rest of the enterprise routers using the IGP.\\nHowever, what would all those new IP routes list as their next-hop addresses? All those new \\nroutes would send packets toward R1, and R1 would send them toward ISP1. Typically, the routers normally used by enterprises would not be designed to perform well with hundreds of thousands of routes in their routing tables.\\nUsing a default route makes much more sense for a single-homed Internet edge design as \\ncompared with learning all those extra IP routes. The enterprise router that connects to the ISP needs one default route, so that for any unknown destinations, the packets are sent to the ISP. The idea is exactly what is discussed in regard to how OSPF advertises default routes back in Chapter 8.\\nWhen using a default routing strategy at the Internet edge, you can statically configure the \\ndefault route, or learn it with eBGP. The OSPF chapter showed the static default route con-figuration, so of course, this chapter shows the effects of using eBGP.\\nFigure 12-9 shows the basic concept. At Step 1, the ISP advertises a default route with \\neBGP. At Step 2, router R1 takes the steps necessary with its IGP so that the IGP then reacts to the eBGP-learned default route, advertising a default route into the enterprise with the IGP.\\nEnterprise\\nIGP –\\nDefault\\n0.0.0.0/0ISP1\\nR1 ISP1\\neBGP12\\nFigure 12-9 ISP Advertises a Default Route; IGP Propagates\\nThat concludes the overview       of BGP and eBGP in preparation for the configuration and \\nverification topics. The rest of the chapter focuses on the eBGP peering between the enter-prise and the ISP, particularly on the enterprise side of the configuration. That includes the details of configuring the peering relationship with the ISP router, advertising the pub-lic prefix (with the \\nnetwork  BGP subcommand), and verifying the eBGP advertised and \\nreceived routes.\\neBGP Configuration and Verification\\nIGP configuration focuses on enabling the routing protocol on interfaces. The configuration may use the \\nnetwork  router subcommand, which the router then compares to interface \\nIPv4 addresses. Alternately, the IGP configuration may use an interface subcommand like \\nptg17396363310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nip ospf  process-id  area  number , which enables the IGP directly    on the interface. Once \\nenabled on an interface, the IGP\\n■Dynamically discovers neighbors that share the same data link off that interface\\n■Advertises known routes to those dynamically discovered neighbors\\n■Advertises about the subnet connected to the interface\\nBGP configuration, in contrast, does    none of the actions in the preceding list. (BGP does use \\na network  command, but for a different purpose.) BGP does form neighbor relationships, \\nbut BGP has no concept of being enabled on an interface, or of dynamically discovering neighbors. Instead, with BGP:\\n■Predefine neighbors with the neighbor  ip-address  remote-as  asn BGP subcommand\\n■Advertise about prefixes that have been added to the BGP table using\\n■The BGP network command\\n■Route redistribution\\n■By learning preﬁ  xes from a neighbor\\nIn some ways, you have to unlearn some of what you know about IGP configuration to learn BGP configuration. This section walks you through the basics.\\nBGP Configuration Concepts\\nBGP uses TCP to transport its messages between two BGP peers, using well-known port 179. When you configure BGP, it opens port 179, waiting for incoming connection requests from other routers. Once a peer connects, the TCP connection is formed. \\nOnce two routers form      a TCP connection for use by BGP, the BGP process on each router \\nmust decide whether the two routers should become neighbors or not. The idea is much like the overall process with OSPF and EIGRP neighbors exchanging messages to decide if they should become neighbors. The two BGP routers send BGP messages that do some basic checks of parameters to make sure the two routers should become peers. If all checks are passed, the two routers become BGP peers (neighbors). At that point, the two routers can exchange routing information.\\nBGP uses the update message to exchange information. Once the BGP peer has been estab-\\nlished, BGP peers send update messages        which hold prefix/length (NLRI) information and the associated path attributes (PA). Those PAs include the AS_Path introduced earlier in the chapter. Figure 12-10 shows an example, the four steps of which are described as follows:\\nStep 1. Because of proper neighbor configuration in the two routers, the two routers \\ncreate a TCP connection with each other and become BGP peers.\\nStep 2. Because of additional configuration, possibly the BGP \\nnetwork  subcommand, \\nRouter R1 adds one or more NLRI and associated PAs to its local BGP table.\\nStep 3. eBGP on R1 advertises all the best routes in its BGP table—that is, the routes it \\nconsiders as best for each NLRI—in a BGP update message sent to router ISP1. \\nIn this case, R1 advertises about NLRI 192.0.2.0/24.\\nStep 4. BGP on ISP1 processes that received update, adding a BGP table entry for \\n192.0.2.0/24.\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  311\\nR1 ISP1\\nNLRI\\n192.0.2.0/24\\n...3$·V\\nAS_Path, etc.NLRI192.0.2.0/24\\n...3$·V\\nAS_Path, etc.21\\n3\\n4UpdateeBGP TCP Connection\\nFigure 12-10 Steps for Advertising a Public Prefix from the Enterprise to an ISP\\nThis process requires two key configuration steps: configuring neighbors, and configuration \\nthat adds entries to a router’s BGP table. The next few pages explain both.\\nConfiguring eBGP Neighbors Using Link Addresses\\nBGP configuration            begins with a familiar type of command: the router bgp  asn command, \\nwhere asn is the AS number used by that enterprise or ISP. That command moves the CLI \\nuser into BGP configuration mode, much like the router ospf , router eigrp , and other \\nsimilar commands.\\nIn a single-homed eBGP design, one link exists between the two routers that need to be \\neBGP peers. As a result, the two routers can use their interface IP addresses. The neighbor  \\npeer-ip-address  BGP subcommand defines the IP address of the neighbor, as shown in \\nFigure 12-11.\\nASN 1\\nG0/2G0/2 198.51.100.1\\nG0/1\\nneighbor 198.51.100.2198.51.100.2 R1 ISP1ASN 1001\\nrouter bgp 1001neighbor 198.51.100.1router bgp 1\\nFigure 12-11 Using Link Addresses for BGP Peering in a Single-Homed Design\\nHowever, the neighbor 198.51.100.2  command shown in the figure for R1 (and the simi-\\nlar command on Router ISP1) is just a partial command. In IOS BGP configuration, you can define many different parameters for a single peer. To do so, IOS expects multiple \\nneigh-\\nbor commands for a single peer. Each command sets a different parameter. For instance, \\nthis chapter shows these options at various points in the chapter:\\nbgp peer-ip-address remote-as asn\\nbgp peer-ip-address shutdown\\nOf these, only the bgp peer-ip-address  remote-as  command     is required. The router bgp  \\nasn global command defines the local router’s ASN, and each bgp peer-ip-address  \\nremote-as  asn command defines a neighbor’s IP address and ASN, as shown in Figure 12-12.\\nptg17396363312  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nASN 1\\nG0/2G0/2 198.51.100.1\\nG0/1 198.51.100.2 R1 ISP1ASN 1001\\nrouter bgp 1001router bgp 1\\nneighbor 198.51.100.2 remote-as 1neighbor 198.51.100.1 remote-as 1001\\nFigure 12-12 Design for Sample eBGP Neighbor Configurations\\nExample 12-1 shows the relevant eBGP configuration          on Routers R1 and ISP1 for the \\ndesign shown in Figures 12-11 and 12-12. \\nExample 12-1 eBGP Neighbor Configuration\\n!

This chapter discusses only this case of \\nusing the common link’s interface IP addresses in eBGP neighbor  commands. eBGP allows \\nthe neighbor  command to refer to any IPv4 address on the BGP neighbor, but other con-\\ncepts must first be understood, and other BGP commands must be configured, for those alternate configurations to work.\\nVerifying eBGP Neighbors\\nThe previous configuration gets BGP started, and         causes an eBGP neighbor relationship to form, but it does not complete the initial configuration. Remember, from earlier Figure 12-10, that BGP must also add entries to its BGP table before it can then advertise that entry (NLRI and associated PAs). With the configuration so far, Routers R1 and ISP1 should be eBGP peers, but not yet have any BGP table entries to send to each other. Example 12-2 shows some sample output to confirm the neighbor relationship, and to confirm that BGP has an empty BGP table. The explanation follows the example. \\nExample 12-2 eBGP Neighbor States and TCP Connection\\nR1# show tcp brief\\nTCB       Local Address               Foreign Address (state)\\n0D0D3F00  198.51.100.1.63680 198.51.100.2.179 ESTAB\\nR1# show ip bgp summary\\nBGP router identifier 192.0.2.1, local AS number 1001\\nBGP table version is 1, main routing table version 1\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  313\\nNeighbor V AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down  State/PfxRcd\\n198.51.100.2    4 1 2 2 1    0    0 00:00:49 0\\nR1#\\nR1# show ip bgp\\nR1#\\nFirst, the show tcp brief  command shows all      TCP connections that terminate at this router \\n(R1), whether BGP or not. Each line lists the local router IP address and TCP port, and the \\nforeign (other device) address and port. In this case, note that 198.51.100.2 uses BGP well-known port 179. With BGP, one router initiates the TCP connection and uses a dynamic port (R1 with port 63680 in this case), connecting to the well-known BGP TCP port 179 on the         other peer.\\nThe \\nshow ip bgp summary  command   lists one line per BGP peer. That one line identifies \\nthe neighbor IP address and the neighbor’s ASN (both found in the neighbor remote-as  \\ncommand). However, that one line of output does not directly identify whether the peer is \\nan eBGP or iBGP peer; instead, you have to compare the neighbor’s AS (in the AS column of the output) with the local ASN in the first line of the output. In this case, with local ASN 1001 and neighbor ASN 1, this particular peer is an eBGP peer.\\nThe \\nshow ip bgp summary  command also lists the BGP process’s BGP router ID. Like \\nIGPs, BGP uses a router ID to identify itself in BGP messages. BGP also uses a familiar pro-\\ncess to choose the router ID, with the same overall logic as OSPF and EIGRP:\\n1.

If unset per Steps 1 and 2, use the same logic as Step 2, but for all nonloopback inter-\\nfaces in an interface up state.\\nContinuing the tour of Example 12-2, make sure and look to the far right of the show ip \\nbgp summary  command, to the heading “State/PfxRcd.” That column either lists the neigh-\\nbor state or, if the neighbor is in a working (“established”) state, lists the number of prefixes \\n(BGP table entries) received from that neighbor. In the output of Example 12-2, the number of prefixes is listed as 0 because Router R1 has learned no prefixes as of yet from the ISP.\\nWhen the neighbor relationship is correct and complete, the final working state is the estab-\\nlished state. When in that state, this column lists the number of prefixes learned from the neighbor. However, if the peer has not yet reached the established state, this column lists             that interim state. Table 12-2 lists the various other BGP neighbor states.\\nTable 12-2 BGP Neighbor States\\nBGP Neighbor \\nStateTypical Reasons\\nIdle The neighbor has been administratively disabled ( neighbor shutdown ), or \\nthe router is waiting before the next retry.\\nConnect The TCP connection is being attempted but has not completed.\\nptg17396363314  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nBGP Neighbor \\nStateTypical Reasons\\nActive The TCP connection has been completed, but no BGP messages have been \\nsent yet.\\nOpensent The TCP connection exists, and this router has sent the first message to \\nestablish the BGP neighbor relationship (a BGP Open message).\\nOpenconfirm The TCP connection exists and the local router has received an Open \\nmessage from the other router.

So, to make it easy to bring down a neighbor, rather than requiring the com-\\nplete removal of those multiple neighbor  commands for that one neighbor, IOS supports \\nthe neighbor shutdown  BGP     subcommand. This command administratively disables that \\nBGP neighbor. The no neighbor shutdown  command then re-enables the neighbor con-\\nnection. Example 12-3 shows an example, as well as the resulting BGP peer state (Idle).\\nExample 12-3 Neighbor State with the Neighbor Shut Down\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

As mentioned in Table \\n12-2, the BGP neighbor Idle state simply refers to a neighbor           that has been configured with \\nthe neighbor shutdown  command.\\nInjecting BGP Table Entries with the network Command\\nAt this point in the sample configurations, R1, the       enterprise router, is not advertising any routes to the ISP with BGP. BGP has a couple of methods of injecting information into the BGP table so that BGP will then advertise those routes. The next few pages show how to make that happen with the BGP \\nnetwork  command, which is the one method specifically \\nmentioned in the exam topics.\\nptg1739636312Chapter 12: Implementing External BGP  315\\nThe BGP network  command works differently than the network  command supported by \\nthe various IGPs. This section details several examples to show the differences, as follows:\\n■Advertising a route for an entire classful network or public address block\\n■Advertising routes for subnets of the public address block\\n■Advertising routes for larger address blocks when only subnets exist in the routing table\\nInjecting Routes for a Classful Network\\nTo begin, consider this straightforward case of an eBGP connection. The enterprise uses a \\nClass C public network (192.0.2.0/24), placing          that entire Class C network in its DMZ, as shown in Figure 12-13.\\neBGP192.0.2.0/24ISP1Rest of\\nEnterprise–\\nPrivate\\n10.0.0.0\\nFW1\\nDMZ\\n192.0.2.0 /24R1\\nG0/2G0/3\\n10.2.2.2G0/1 G0/2198.51.100.2 198.51.100.2\\n10.2.2.1\\nFigure 12-13 All of Class C Network 192.0.2.0/24 Used as DMZ Subnet\\nR1 needs to advertise its public prefix (192.0.2.0/24) to the ISP. R1 also needs to avoid advertising its private address space to the ISP (10.0.0.0/8). Why? Routers in the Internet need to know how to forward packets to the enterprise’s public address range. However, many companies use the same private IPv4 networks, such as IPv4 network 10.0.0.0, and by definition, these networks are not advertised into the Internet.\\nTo advertise its public prefix, the enterprise network engineer can configure a BGP \\nnetwork  command on R1. This command lets the engineer easily control which prefixes R1 \\nadds to its BGP table. Once in the BGP table, the router then advertises the prefixes to the \\nISP. The network  command basically tells BGP this:\\nPut this prefix/length into the BGP table, assuming that prefix/length is in the IP routing \\ntable. \\nFigure 12-14 details the logic of the BGP network  prefix  mask  DDN-mask  command. \\nThe network  command lists a prefix and DDN-style mask (Step 1 in the figure). IOS then \\ncompares that prefix and mask to the prefix/mask for the routes in the IPv4 routing table. \\nBGP looks for an exact match (Step 2), meaning that the BGP network  command’s prefix \\nand mask both exactly match a prefix and mask in a route in the routing table. If a match is found (Step 3), BGP on that router creates a matching BGP table entry. BGP advertises the best valid routes from its BGP table to its BGP peers (Step 4).\\nptg17396363316  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRouter Internals\\nnetwork 192.0.2.0\\n mask 255.255.255.0Update1\\n234IP Routing Table\\n10.1.1.0/24\\n10.1.2.0/24192.0.2.0/24BGP Table\\nNLRI\\n192.0.2.0/24\\nFigure 12-14 Configuration Concept: the BGP network  Command\\nWhen the router using eBGP already has an IP route for the exact prefix it wants to adver-\\ntise with BGP, configuring the BGP network  command is easy. All you have to do is config-\\nure a BGP network  command, listing that exact IPv4 prefix and mask. For example, in the \\ndesign both shown in Figure 12-13 and represented logically in Figure 12-14, Router R1 will know a route for classful network 192.0.2.0/24, as learned via OSPF from the firewall. \\nExample 12-4 continues the same configuration example begun with Figure 12-12 and \\nExample 12-1. It shows the addition of the \\nnetwork 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0  \\nBGP subcommand, which lists that exact prefix and exact mask (although in DDN format, not prefix format). The output at the end of the example confirms that R1 has that route, and the BGP          table entry created on Router R1—basically the first three steps in Figure 12-14.\\nExample 12-4 R1 BGP Configuration with \\nnetwork  Command; Resulting BGP Table\\nEntry\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The show ip route \\n192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes  command lists all IPv4 routes in the range of \\n192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0, one route per line. Note that only one route exists in this range: a route for exactly 192.0.2.0/24, with next-hop address 10.2.2.2 (which is the firewall’s IP address).\\nThe \\nshow ip bgp  command lists R1’s BGP table, first with several lines of legend, followed \\nby one line for each prefix in the table (only one entry in this case). First, look at the values \\nin the network and next hop columns: it lists the same prefix and next-hop as taken from the IP routing table. Also, of particular importance, note the characters * and > on the far left, which per the legend mean that the route is valid and that this route is the best route to reach this prefix. In cases for which BGP has learned multiple routes to reach one prefix, BGP lists a > beside the best route per the BGP best path algorithm.\\nNow that R1 has a table entry for the enterprise’s public prefix of 192.0.2.0/24, R1 adver-\\ntises that prefix and associated PAs to its eBGP peer. Example 12-5          shows the BGP table and IPv4 routing table on Router ISP1.\\nExample 12-5 ISP1’s BGP and IP Routing Tables \\nISP1# show ip bgp\\nBGP table version is 2, local router ID is 2.2.2.2\\nStatus codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal, \\nr RIB-failure, S Stale, m multipath, b backup-path, f RT-Filter, \\nx best-external, a additional-path, c RIB-compressed, \\nOrigin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete\\nRPKI validation codes: V valid, I invalid, N Not found\\n     Network          Next Hop Metric LocPrf Weight Path\\n *>  192.0.2.0 198.51.100.1 2 0 1001 i\\nISP1# show ip route 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes    \\n!

Note that the show ip bgp  command’s Path column now lists ASN 1001, whereas \\nthat column in R1’s output listed no ASNs. (That column lists the AS_Path PA, which in this case lists the enterprise’s ASN.) Also, note ISP1’s next-hop address for this prefix, 198.51.100.1, which is R1’s IP address on the link between R1 and ISP1. By default, when a router learns a prefix with eBGP, like the route ISP1 is shown to learn in Example 12-5, the router uses the IP address of the eBGP neighbor as the next-hop address. \\nptg17396363318  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nISP1’s show ip route  command lists one route, the route for 192.0.2.0/24. Of note, see \\nthat the administrative distance is 20 (the first number inside square brackets). eBGP has a \\ndefault administrative distance of 20, while iBGP routes use 200. The code on the far left lists “B,” for a BGP-learned route, and the same next-hop IP address of 198.51.100.1 as listed          in the BGP table. \\nAdvertising Subnets to the ISP \\nOften, an enterprise takes its one public address          block and breaks it into subnets. As a result, the Internet edge router likely has routes for each of those subnets, rather than one route for the entire public address block. \\nOne method to solve this problem is to advertise the subnets of the public address block \\nto the ISP. The ISP probably does not want to use this solution, but for the sake of show-ing another example, this section includes one example, based on Figure 12-15. The enterprise has been assigned Class C network 192.0.2.0/24, and has created two subnets: 192.0.2.128/26, used for the DMZ on the other side of a firewall, and 192.0.2.0/29, used for NAT, and assigned to interface loopback 1 on Router R1. \\nFW1\\nDMZ\\n192.0.2.128 /26G0/2\\n10.2.2.2 eBGP192.0.2.0/29R1 ISP1Rest of\\nEnterprise–\\nPrivate\\n10.0.0.0192.0.2.0 /29\\nLoopback1NAT\\nG0/3 G0/1 G0/2\\n10.2.2.1192.0.2.128/26\\nFigure 12-15 Using Two Subnets of 192.0.2.0/24: DMZ and NAT\\nExample 12-6 begins with all the IPv4 addressing configured per Figure 12-15, only needing the addition of the BGP configuration. For this solution, the engineer configured          \\nnetwork  \\ncommands that match the two specific subnets: 192.0.2.0/29 and 192.0.2.128/26. \\nExample 12-6 R1 BGP Configuration with two network  Commands\\nR1# show ip route 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes\\n192.0.2.0/24 is variably subnetted, 3 subnets, 3 masks\\nC 192.0.2.0/29 is directly connected, Loopback1\\nL 192.0.2.1/32 is directly connected, Loopback1\\nO 192.0.2.128/26 [110/2] via 10.2.2.2, 03:45:00, GigabitEthernet0/2R1#\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

R1 \\nwould then advertise both subnets to Router ISP1. However, in most cases, the ISP does not want to learn about the subnets of the enterprise’s public address block: the ISP wants to learn one route for the whole public address block (in these examples, 192.0.2.0/24). The challenge with this latest example is that R1 does not have a route for 192.0.2.0/24, so the \\nnetwork  command cannot trigger the process of adding a BGP table entry for 192.0.2.0/24.\\nOne method to overcome that problem (and the only one shown in this chapter) uses a static IPv4 route called   a \\ndiscard route . In Example 12-6, the network 192.0.2.0 mask \\n255.255.255.0  would not add a BGP table entry on R1 because R1 did not have a match-\\ning IPv4 route. The solution? Configure a static route for that exact prefix, causing a static route to be added to the IPv4 routing table. However, give the route an outgoing interface of \\nnull0 . This route, the discard route, makes the router discard any packets that match the \\nroute. (If you are now confused, be patient and work through this next example. Using a discard route collects several concepts beyond BGP, so it takes a few moments to see how the pieces fit together.)\\nSo, review Figure 12-15 again, to get your bearings. R1 has routes for 192.0.2.0/29 and \\n192.0.2.128/26. Then, instead of the BGP configuration shown in Example 12-6, use the configuration in Example 12-7, which includes the addition of the discard route.\\nExample 12-7 R1 BGP Configuration with Discard Route for 192.0.2.0/24\\nip route 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 null0\\n!\\nrouter bgp 1001\\n network 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0\\nNext, look just at the IPv4 routes in the range of 192.0.2.0/24, as shown in Example 12-8. It \\nshows the 192.0.2.0/29 subnet used by NAT (and the 192.0.2.1/32 route for the interface IP address for that interface). It shows the route for prefix 192.0.2.128/26 used for the DMZ. And         it shows an overlapping route, the discard route, for 192.0.2.0/24.  \\nptg17396363320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 12-8 Evidence of Discard Route\\nR1# show ip route 192.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 longer-prefixes\\n!

As a result, with these overlapping routes:\\n1. Packets sent to the NAT subnet (192.0.2.0/29) would match both the 192.0.2.0/29\\nroute and the route to 192.0.2.0/24, but IOS uses the more specific (longer prefix)\\nroute with the /29 prefix length.\\n2. Packets sent to the DMZ subnet (192.0.2.128/26) would match both the\\n192.0.2.128/26 route and the route to 192.0.2.0/24, but IOS uses the more specific(longer prefix) route with the /26 prefix length, and forwards packets to the firewall.\\n3. Other packets in the range of network 192.0.2.0/24 that do not also match\\n192.0.2.0/29 or 192.0.2.128/26 would match only the discard route (192.0.2.0/24) andare discarded.\\nAdding this static discard route has not harmed IPv4 routing at all, in that packets going \\nto the used IP addresses in the 192.0.2.0/24 address range already have a more specific working route. However, adding that static discard route solves our BGP problem: the BGP \\nnetwork  command now sees a route for 192.0.2.0/24 in the IP routing table, so BGP adds \\nan entry to the BGP         table per that route.

This route is another eBGP-learned route, so it lists the eBGP neighbor as the next-hop address by default. At the far right, the AS_Path lists one short ASN (ASN 1), ISP1’s ASN.

Part \\nIII of this book looks at one long-available option, in Chapter 13, breaking down the idea of a serial link and the protocols that control those links. Chapter 14 then moves on to the more common private WAN technologies seen today, namely Metro Ethernet and MPLS. Part III closes with Chapter 15, which examines how a company can use the Internet to cre-ate a private WAN using Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology. Chapter 15 goes into some implementation depth with two protocols that enable the VPNs in the Internet, spe-cifically GRE and PPPoE.\\nptg17396363Part III\\nWide-Area Networks\\nChapter 13:  Implementing Point-to-Point WANs\\nChapter 14:  Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS\\nChapter 15:  Private WANs with Internet VPNs\\nPart III Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 13\\nImplementing Point-to-Point WANs\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n3.0 WAN Technologies\\n3.1 Configure and verify PPP and MLPPP on WAN interfaces using local authentication\\nLeased-line WANs—also known as serial links—require much less thought than many other \\ntopics, at least to the depth required for the CCENT and CCNA R&S exams. That simplic-ity allows the Cisco exams to discuss leased lines briefly for the ICND1 exam, while using leased lines as part of larger discussions of IP routing.\\nThis chapter finally takes the discussion of leased-line WANs deeper than has been discussed \\nso far. This chapter briefly repeats the leased line concepts from the ICND1 book, to lay a foundation to discuss other concepts. More important, this chapter looks at the configuration, verification, and troubleshooting steps for leased lines that use the familiar High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) data-link protocol and the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).\\nThis chapter breaks the material down into three major sections. The first looks at leased-\\nline WANS that use HDLC, by reviewing and adding details about the physical links them-selves, along with HDLC (and related) configuration. The second major section discusses PPP, an alternate data-link protocol that you can use instead of HDLC, with a focus on con-cepts and configuration. The final major section then discusses typical root causes of serial link problems and how to find those problems.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

None of the above.\\nFoundation Topics\\nLeased-Line WANs with HDLC\\nA physical leased-line WAN works a lot like in an Ethernet crossover cable connecting two \\nrouters, but with no distance limitations. As shown in Figure 13-1, each router can send at any time (full duplex). The speed   is also symmetric, meaning that both routers send bits at the same speed.\\nR2 R1\\nAll the TimeX bits/second\\nX bits/second\\nFigure 13-1 Leased Line: Same Speed, Both Directions, Always On\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  331\\nAlthough the leased line provides a physical layer bit transmission facility, routers also \\nneed to use a data link protocol on the WAN link to send bits over the link. The story should be familiar by now: routers receive frames in LAN interfaces, and then the router de-encapsulates the network layer packet. Before forwarding the packet, the router encapsulates the packet inside a WAN data link protocol like High-level Data Link Control    (HDLC), as shown at Step 2 of Figure 13-2. \\nPC1LAN1 HDLC LAN2\\nPC2\\nR1 R2\\n802.3 IP Packet 1 HDLC IP Packet 2 802.3 IP Packet 3 802.3 HDLC 802.3\\nFigure 13-2 Routers and Their Use of HDLC to Encapsulate Packets\\nThese first two figures review some of the Layer 1 and Layer 2 details, respectively, of leased-line WANs. This first major section of this chapter begins by discussing these links again, first with the Layer 1 details, followed by the Layer 2 details. This   section ends with an explanation of HDLC configuration details.\\nLayer 1 Leased Lines\\nLeased lines have been around a long time, roughly 20 years longer than LANs. However, they still exist today as a WAN service.\\nAs a result of their long history in the market, the networking world has used a large num-\\nber of different terms. First, the term leased line refers to the fact that the company using the leased line does not own the line, but instead pays a monthly lease fee to use it. Often, you lease the service from a telephone   company, or telco. However, many people today use \\nthe generic term  service provider to refer to a company that provides any form of WAN connectivity, including Internet services. Table 13-2 lists some of those names so that you can understand the different terms you will encounter in a real networking job.\\nTable 13-2 Different Names for a Leased Line\\nName Meaning or Reference\\nLeased circuit, \\ncircuitThe words line and circuit are often used as synonyms in telco terminology; circuit makes reference to the electrical circuit between the two endpoints.\\nSerial link, serial lineThe words link and line are also often used as synonyms. Serial in this case \\nrefers to the fact that the bits flow serially and that routers use serial interfaces. \\nPoint-to-point link, point-to-point lineRefers to the fact that the topology stretches between two points, and two points only. (Some older leased lines allowed more than two devices.) \\nT1 A specific type of leased line that transmits data at 1.544 megabits per second (1.544 Mbps). \\nW AN link, link Both these terms are very general, with no reference to any specific technology.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B 2 A, C 3 C 4 A, D 5 B, D 6 A, E 7 C, D\\nptg17396363332  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe Physical Components of a Leased Line\\nTo create a leased line, the telco     must create some physical transmission path between the \\ntwo routers on the ends of the link. The physical cabling must leave the buildings where each router sits. Then the telco must create the equivalent of a two-pair circuit from end to end, with one circuit to send data in each direction (full duplex). Figure 13-3 shows one such example, in which the telco uses a couple of traditional central office (CO) switches to create a short leased line between two routers.\\nCustomer Site1\\nUndergroundTelco CO1 Telco CO2 Customer Site2\\nSwitch-1 Switch-2R1 R2\\nFigure 13-3 Possible Cabling Inside a Telco for a Short Leased Line\\nThe details in the center of Figure 13-3 probably show more than you ever need to know about leased-line WANs, at least from the enterprise customer perspective. More common-ly, most network engineers think more about a leased line from the perspective of Figure 13-4, which shows a few key components and terms for the equipment on the ends of a leased line, as follows:\\nCustomer premises equipment (CPE): This telco   term refers to the gear that sits at their \\ncustomers’ sites on the ends on the link.\\nChannel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU): This    device provides a function \\ncalled clocking, in which it physically controls the speed and timing at which the router \\nserial interface sends and receives each bit over the serial cable.\\nSerial cable: This is a short cable  that connects the CSU and the router serial interface.\\nCSU CSUTELCO\\nCPE CPEShort Cables (Usually Less Than 50 Feet)\\nR1 R2Long Cables (Can Be Several Miles Long)\\nFigure 13-4 Point-to-Point Leased Line: Components and Terminology\\nThe CPE includes several separately orderable parts. When using an external CSU/DSU, \\na serial cable must be used to connect the CSU to the router serial interface. These serial interfaces usually exist as part of a removable card on the router, called either       WAN inter-face cards (WIC), High-speed WICs (HWIC), or Network Interface Modules (NIM). Most \\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  333\\nof the serial interfaces use one style (size/shape) of physical connector called a smart serial \\nconnector, whereas the CSU has one of several other types of connectors. So, when install-ing the leased line, the engineer must choose the correct cable type, with connectors to match the WIC on one end and the CSU/DSU on the other. Figure 13-5 shows a drawing of one type of serial cable, with the smart serial connector on the left, and the popular V.35 connector on the right. The figure shows a     side view of the entire cable, plus direct views into the connector on the ends of the cable.\\nDirect\\nViewSide\\nViewDirect\\nView\\nV.35Side\\nView\\nSmart\\nSerial\\nFigure 13-5 Serial Cables Used Between a CSU and a Router\\nToday, many leased lines make use of Cisco WICs with an integrated CSU/DSU. That is, the WIC hardware includes the same functions as a CSU/DSU, so an external CSU/DSU is not needed. Compared to Figure 13-4, the external CSU/DSU and serial cable on each end are not needed, with the cable from the telco connecting directly to the WIC.\\nFigure 13-6 shows a photo of a router with two NIM slots. Each slot currently shows a \\nfaceplate with no NIM cards installed. The foreground of the figure shows a NIM with two serial ports, with smart serial interfaces. The cable end on the left of the drawing in Figure 13-5 would attach to one of these smart serial ports on the NIM in Figure 13-6.\\n2-Port Serial NIMGi0/1Aux\\n2 NIM Slots\\nRS-45\\nConsole\\nGi0/0\\n(RJ-45 or SFP)USB\\nFigure 13-6 Photo of Router with Serial NIM on the Right \\nTelcos offer a wide variety of speeds for leased lines. However, a telco customer cannot pick just any speed. Instead, the speeds follow the standards of an age-old technology called the      T-carrier system.\\nptg17396363334  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nBack in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S.-based Bell companies developed and deployed digital \\nvoice and the T-carrier system. As part of that work, they standardized different transmis-sion speeds, including 64 Kbps, 1.544 Mbps, and 44.736 Mbps.\\nThose same Bell companies developed   time-division multiplexing (TDM) technology that let \\nthem combine multiples of these base speeds onto a single line. For instance, one popular standard, a   Digital Signal level 1 (DS1), or T1, combines 24 DS0s (at 64 Kbps) plus 8 Kbps of overhead into one physical line that runs at 1.544 Mbps. However, to allow flexibility of speeds offered to customers, the telco could install a T1 line to many sites, but run some at slower speeds and some at faster speeds—as long as those speeds were multiples of 64 Kbps.\\nNow back to the idea of the speed of a leased line. What can you actually buy? Basically, at \\nslower speeds, you get any multiple of 64 Kbps, up to T1 speed. At faster speeds, you can get multiples of T1 speed, up to T3 speed. Table 13-3 summarizes     the speeds typically seen in the United States, with a few from Europe.\\nTable 13-3 WAN Speed Summary\\nNames of Line Bit Rate\\nDS0 64 Kbps \\nFractional T1 Multiples  of 64 Kbps, up to 24X \\nDS1 (T1) 1.544 Mbps (24 DS0s, for 1.536 Mbps, plus 8 Kbps overhead)  \\nE1 (Europe) 2.048 Mbps (32 DS0s) \\nFractional T3 Multiples  of 1.536 Mbps, up to 28X \\nDS3 (T3) 44.736 Mbps (28 DS1s, plus mana gement overhead)  \\nE3 (Europe) Approx. 34 Mbps (16 E1s, plus mana gement overhead) \\nThe Role of the CSU/DSU\\nFor our last bit of discussion about WAN links in a working enterprise internetwork, next consider the role of the     CSU/DSU (called CSU for short). For the sake of discussion, the next few paragraphs, leading up to Figure 13-7, assume a leased line with external CSU/DSUs, like earlier in Figure 13-4.\\nThe CSU sits between the telco leased line and the router; it understands both worlds and \\ntheir conventions at Layer 1. On the telco side, that means the CSU connects to the line from the telco, so it must understand all these details about the T-carrier system, TDM, and the speed used by the telco. On the router side of the equation, the CSU connects to the router, with roles called the DCE and DTE, respectively. The CSU, acting as   DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment), controls the speed of the router serial interface. The router, acting as   DTE (data terminal equipment), is controlled by the clocking signals from the CSU (DCE). That is, the CSU tells the router when to send and receive bits; the router attempts to send and receive bits only when the DCE creates the correct electrical impulses (called clocking) on the cable. Figure 13-7     shows a diagram of those main concepts of the role of the CSU/DSU.\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  335\\nCSU/\\nDSU– Send When Clocked\\n– Receive When Clocked– Use Clocking to Control Router– Use Configured Speed\\nDTE DCESerial CableClock Signals\\nFigure 13-7 DCE and DTE Roles for a CSU/DSU and a Router Serial Interface\\nBuilding a WAN Link in a Lab\\nOn a practical note, to prepare for the CCENT and CCNA R&S exams, you might choose \\nto buy some used router and switch hardware for hands-on practice. If you do, you can create the equivalent of a leased line, without a real leased line from a telco, and without CSU/DSUs, just using a cabling trick. This short discussion tells you enough information to create a WAN link in your home lab.\\nFirst, when building a real WAN link      with a real telco facility between sites, the serial cables \\nnormally used between a router and an external CSU/DSU are called DTE cables. That is, \\nthe serial cables in earlier Figure 13-4 are DTE cables.\\nYou can create an equivalent WAN link just by connecting two routers’ serial interfaces using \\none DTE cable and a slightly different DCE cable, with no CSUs and with no leased line from the telco. The DCE cable has a female connector, and the DTE cable has a male connector, which allows the two cables to be attached directly. That completes the physical connection, providing a path for the data. The DCE cable also does the equivalent of an Ethernet crossover cable by swapping the transmit and receive wire pairs, as shown in Figure 13-8.\\nSerial\\nCableSerial\\nCableDTE DCEclock rate Command Goes Here\\nTx\\nRxTx\\nRxTxRxTx\\nRx\\nDTE Cable DCE CableRouter 2 Router 1\\nFigure 13-8 Serial Cabling Uses a DTE Cable and a DCE Cable\\nThe figure shows the cable details at the top, with the wiring details at the bottom. In particu-\\nlar, at the bottom of the figure, note that the DTE serial cable acts as a straight-through cable and does not swap the transmit and receive pair, whereas the DCE cable does swap the pairs.\\nNOTE Many vendors, for convenience, sell a single cable that combines the two cables shown in Figure 13-8 into a single cable. Search online for “Cisco serial crossover” to find examples.\\nptg17396363336  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinally, to make the link work, the router with the DCE cable installed must provide clock-\\ning. A router serial interface can provide clocking, but it can do so only if a DCE cable is connected to the interface and by the configuration of the clock rate command. Newer IOS versions will sense the presence of a DCE cable and automatically set a clock rate, so that the link will    work, but old IOS versions require that you configure the clock rate command.\\nLayer 2 Leased Lines with HDLC\\nA leased line provides a Layer 1 service. It promises to deliver bits between the devices con-nected to the leased line. However, the leased line itself does not define a data link layer protocol to be used on the leased line. HDLC provides     one option for a data link protocol for a leased line.\\nHDLC has only a few big functions to perform with the simple point-to-point topology of a \\npoint-to-point leased line. First, the frame header lets the receiving router know that a new frame is coming. Plus, like all the other data link protocols, the HDLC trailer has a   Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field that the receiving router can use to decide whether the frame had errors in transit, and if so, discard the frame.\\nCisco adds another function to the ISO standard HDLC protocol by adding an extra field \\n(a Type field) to the HDLC header, creating a Cisco-specific version of HDLC, as shown in Figure 13-9. The Type field allows Cisco routers to support multiple types of network layer packets to cross the HDLC link. For example, an HDLC link between two Cisco routers can forward both IPv4 and IPv6 packets because the Type field can identify which type of packet is      encapsulated inside each HDLC frame.\\nProprietary Cisco HDLC (Adds Type Field)\\nBytes 11 1 2 Variable 2\\nFlagAddress Control Data FCS Type\\nFigure 13-9 Cisco HDLC Framing\\nToday, the HDLC Address and Control fields have little work to do. For instance, with only two routers on a link, when a router sends a frame, it is clear that the frame is sent to the only other router on the link. Both the Address and Control fields had important purposes in years past, but today they are unimportant.\\nRouters use HDLC just like any other data link protocol used by routers: to move packets \\nto the next router. Figure 13-10 shows three      familiar routing steps, with the role of HDLC sitting at Step 2. \\nPC1LAN1 HDLC LAN2\\nPC2\\nR1 R2\\n802.3 IP Packet 1 HDLC IP Packet 2 802.3 IP Packet 3 802.3 HDLC 802.3\\nFigure 13-10 General Concept of Routers De-encapsulating and Re-encapsulating IP \\nPackets\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  337\\nHere is a walkthrough of the steps in the figure:\\n1. To send the IP packet to router R1, PC1 encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet\\nframe.\\n2. Router R1 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet, encapsulates the packet into anHDLC frame using an HDLC header and trailer, and forwards the HDLC frame torouter R2.\\n3. Router R2 de-encapsulates (removes) the IP packet, encapsulates the packet into anEthernet frame, and forwards the Ethernet frame to PC2.\\nIn summary, a leased line with HDLC creates a WAN link between two routers so that they \\ncan forward packets for the devices on the attached LANs. The leased line itself provides the physical means to transmit the bits, in both directions. The HDLC frames provide the means to encapsulate the network layer packet correctly so it crosses the link between routers.\\nConfiguring HDLC\\nThink back to router Ethernet interfaces for a moment. Router Ethernet interfaces require no configuration related to Layers 1 and 2 for the interface to be up and working, for-warding IP traffic. The Layer 1 details occur by default once the cabling has been installed correctly. Router Ethernet interfaces, of course, use Ethernet as the data link protocol by default. The router only needs to configure an IP address on the interface, and possibly enable the interface with the no shutdown command if the interface is in an “administra-tively down” state.\\nSimilarly, serial interfaces on Cisco routers need no specific Layer 1 or 2 configuration com-\\nmands. For Layer 1, the cabling needs to be completed, of course, but the router attempts to use the serial interface once the no shutdown command is configured. For Layer 2, IOS defaults to use HDLC on serial interfaces. As on Ethernet interfaces, router serial interfaces usually only need an ip address command, and possibly the no shutdown command, assum-ing both routers’ interfaces otherwise have default settings.\\nHowever, many optional commands exist for serial links. The following list outlines some \\nconfiguration steps, listing the conditions     for which some commands are needed, plus com-mands that are purely optional:\\nStep 1. Use the ip address address mask command in interface configuration mode to \\nconfigure the interface IP address.\\nStep 2. The following tasks are required only when the specifically listed conditions are true:\\nA. If an encapsulation protocol interface subcommand already exists, \\nfor a non-HDLC protocol, use the encapsulation hdlc command in interface configuration mode to enable HDLC. Alternatively, use the no \\nencapsulation protocol command in interface configuration mode to \\nuse the default setting of HDLC as the data link protocol.\\nB. If the interface line status is administratively down, use the no \\nshutdown command in interface configuration mode to enable the interface.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg17396363338  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nC. If the serial link is a back-to-back serial link in a lab (or a simulator), use \\nthe clock rate speed command in interface configuration mode to con-\\nfigure the clocking rate. Use this command only on the one router with \\nthe DCE cable (per the show controllers serial number command).\\nStep 3. The following steps are always optional and have no impact on whether the link works and passes IP traffic:\\nA. Use the bandwidth speed-in-kbps command in interface configuration \\nmode to configure the link’s documented speed so that it matches the actual clock rate of the link.\\nB. For documentation purposes, use the description text command in \\ninterface configuration mode to configure a description of the purpose of the interface.\\nIn practice, when you configure a Cisco router with no preexisting interface configuration \\nand install a normal production serial link with CSU/DSUs, the ip address and no shutdown \\ncommands are likely the only configuration commands you would need.\\nFigure 13-11 shows a sample internetwork, and Example 13-1 shows the matching HDLC \\nconfiguration. In this case, the serial link was created with a back-to-back serial link in a lab, requiring Steps 1 (ip address) and 2C (clock rate) from     the preceding list. It also shows optional Step 3B (description).\\nDCE192.168.2.2192.168.2.1 192.168.1.1\\nS0/0/0 G0/0192.168.4.2\\nG0/1S0/0/1 R1 R2192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.4.0/24\\nFigure 13-11 Typical Serial Link Between Two Routers\\nExample 13-1 HDLC Configuration\\nR1# show running-config\\n!

The matching configuration on R2’s S0/0/1 \\ninterface simply needs an ip address command plus the default settings of encapsulation hdlc and no shutdown. The clock rate command would not be needed on R2 because R1 has the DCE cable, so R2 must be connected to a DTE cable.\\nExample 13-2 lists two commands that confirm the configuration on R1 and some other \\ndefault settings. First, it lists the output from the show controllers command for S0/0/0, which confirms that R1 indeed has a DCE cable installed and that the clock rate has been set to 2000000 bps. The show interfaces S0/0/0 command lists the various configuration settings near the top, including the default encapsulation value (HDLC) and default band-width setting on a serial interface (1544, meaning 1544 Kbps or 1.544 Mbps). It also lists the IP address,      prefix-style mask (/24), and description, as configured in Example 13-1.\\nExample 13-2 Verifying the Configuration Settings on R1\\nR1# show controllers serial 0/0/0\\nInterface Serial0/0/0\\nHardware is SCC\\nDCE V.35, clock rate 2000000\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nR1# show interfaces s0/0/0\\nSerial0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Hardware is WIC MBRD Serial  Description: link to R2\\n  Internet address is 192.168.2.1/24\\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec,\\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255  Encapsulation HDLC, loopback not set\\n  Keepalive set (10 sec)\\n  Last input 00:00:01, output 00:00:00, output hang never\\n  Last clearing of \"show interface\" counters never  Input queue: 0/75/0/0 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0\\n  Queueing strategy: fifo\\n  Output queue: 0/40 (size/max)\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n     276 packets input, 19885 bytes, 0 no buffer\\n     Received 96 broadcasts (0 IP multicasts)\\n     0 runts, 0 giants, 0 throttles     0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored, 0 abort\\n     284 packets output, 19290 bytes, 0 underruns\\n     0 output errors, 0 collisions, 5 interface resets\\n     0 unknown protocol drops     0 output buffer failures, 0 output buffers swapped out\\n     7 carrier transitions\\n     DCD=up  DSR=up  DTR=up  RTS=up  CTS=up\\nptg17396363340  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinally, the router uses the serial interface only if it reaches an up/up interface status, as \\nshown in the first line of the output of the show interfaces S0/0/0 command in Example 13-2.

However, HDLC was created for a world without routers. In contrast, PPP, defined in the 1990s, was designed with routers, TCP/IP, and other network layer protocols in mind, with many more advanced features.\\nThis second major section of this chapter first discusses PPP concepts, including one exam-\\nple of a more advanced PPP feature (authentication). This section ends with some configura-tion examples using PPP.\\nPPP Concepts\\nPPP provides several basic but    important functions that are useful on a leased line that con-nects two devices:\\n■Definition of a header and trailer that allows delivery of a data frame over the link\\n■Support for both synchronous and asynchronous links\\n■A protocol Type field in the header, allowing multiple Layer 3 protocols to pass over the\\nsame link\\n■Built-in authentication tools: Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge\\nHandshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  341\\n■Control protocols for each higher-layer protocol that rides over PPP, allowing easier\\nintegration and support of those protocols\\nThe next several pages take a closer look at the protocol field, authentication, and the con-\\ntrol protocols.\\nPPP Framing\\nUnlike the standard     version of HDLC, the PPP standard defines a protocol field. The protocol field identifies the type of packet inside the frame. When PPP was created, this field allowed packets from the many different Layer 3 protocols to pass over a single link. Today, the protocol Type field still provides the same function, usually supporting packets for the two different versions of IP (IPv4 and IPv6). Figure 13-12 shows the PPP framing, which happens to mirror the Cisco-proprietary HDLC framing that includes a protocol Type field (as shown earlier in Figure 13-9).\\nPPP\\nBytes 11 1 2 Variable 2\\nFlagAddress Control Data FCS Type\\nFigure 13-12 PPP Framing\\nPPP Control Protocols\\nIn addition to HDLC-like framing, PPP defines a set of Layer 2 control protocols that per-form various link control functions. The      idea of these extra protocols works a little like how Ethernet includes additional protocols like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Ethernet has headers and trailers to deliver frames, plus it defines overhead protocols like STP to help make the frame forwarding process work better. Likewise, PPP defines the frame format in Figure 13-12, plus it defines other protocols to help manage and control the serial link.\\nPPP separates these control protocols into two main categories:\\n■Link Control Protocol (LCP): This one   protocol has several different individual func-\\ntions, each focused on the data link itself, ignoring the Layer 3 protocol sent across thelink.\\n■Network Control Protocols (NCP): This is a category of   protocols, one per networklayer protocol. Each protocol performs functions specific to its related Layer 3 protocol.\\nThe PPP LCP implements the control functions that work the same regardless of the Layer 3 \\nprotocol. For features related to any higher-layer protocols, usually Layer 3 protocols, PPP uses a series of PPP control protocols (CP), such as IP Control Protocol (IPCP). PPP uses one instance of LCP per link and one NCP for each Layer 3 protocol defined on the link. For example, on a PPP link using IPv4, IPv6, and Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), the link uses      one instance of LCP plus IPCP (for IPv4), IPv6CP (for IPv6), and CDPCP (for CDP).\\nTable 13-4 summarizes the functions of LCP, gives the LCP feature names, and describes \\nthe features briefly. Following the table, the text explains one of the features, PPP authen-tication, in more detail. Later, the section “Implementing Multilink PPP” discusses the Multilink PPP (MLPPP) feature. \\nptg17396363342  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 13-4 PPP LCP Features\\nFunction LCP Feature Description\\nLooped link \\ndetectionMagic number Detects whether the link is looped, and disables the \\ninterface, allowing rerouting over a working route  \\nError detection Link-quality \\nmonitoring (LQM)Disables an interface that exceeds an error percentage threshold, allowing rerouting over better routes\\nMultilink support Multilink PPP Load balances tra ffic over multiple parallel links\\nAuthentication PAP and CHAP Exchanges names and passwords so that each device \\ncan verify the identity of the device on the other end of the link\\nPPP Authentication\\nIn networking, authentication gives one     device a way to confirm that another device is truly \\nthe correct and approved device with which communications should occur. In other words, authentication confirms that the other party is the authentic other party, and not some imposter.\\nFor instance, with PPP, if R1 and R2 are supposed to be communicating over a serial link, \\nR1 might want R2 to somehow prove that the device claiming to be R2 really is R2. In that scenario, R1 wants to authenticate R2, with the authentication process providing a way for R2 to prove its identity.\\nWAN authentication is most often needed when dial lines are used. However, the configu-\\nration of the authentication features remains the same whether a leased line or dial line is used.\\nPPP defines two authentication protocols: PAP and CHAP. Both protocols require the \\nexchange of messages between devices, but with different details. With PAP, the process works with the to-be-authenticated device starting the messages, claiming to be legitimate by listing a secret password in clear text, as shown in Figure 13-13.\\nAck.Wait on Other Router\\nFred\\n(Authenticating)Here is My Text Password\\nBarney\\n(Being Authenticated)I Am Barney\\nPassword = Betty1\\n2\\nFigure 13-13 PAP Authentication Process\\nIn the figure, when the link comes up, authentication takes two steps. At Step 1, Barney sends the shared password in clear text. Fred, who wants to authenticate Barney—that is, confirm that Barney is the real Barney—sees the password. Fred, configured with Barney’s name and password, checks that configuration, confirming that it is the correct password, and sends back an acknowledgment that Barney has passed the authentication process.\\nCHAP, a much      more secure option, uses different messages, and it hides the password. \\nWith CHAP, the device doing the authentication (Fred) begins with a message called   a chal-lenge, which asks the other device to reply. The big difference is that the second message \\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  343\\nin the flow (as shown in Figure 13-14) hides the authentication password by instead sending \\na hashed version of the password. Router Fred has been preconfigured with Barney’s name and password in such a way that Fred can confirm that the hashed password sent by Barney is indeed the same password that Fred lists in his configuration for Barney. If the password is indeed the correct password, Fred sends back a third message to confirm the successful authentication     of Barney.\\nI Am #$%#$@Ask Other Router\\nFred\\n(Authenticating)React to Challenge\\nBarney\\n(Being Authenticated)Challenge! 1\\nAccepted 32\\nFigure 13-14 CHAP Authentication Process\\nBoth Figures 13-13 and 13-14 show authentication flows when authentication works. When it fails (for instance, if the passwords do not match), a different final message flows. Also, if the authentication fails, PPP leaves the interface in an up/down state, and the router cannot forward and receive frames on the interface.\\nPAP flows are much less secure      than CHAP because PAP sends the hostname and password \\nin clear text in the message. These can be read easily if someone places a tracing tool in the circuit. CHAP instead uses a one-way hash algorithm, called message digest 5 (MD5), with input to the algorithm being a password that never crosses the link plus a shared random number.\\nThe CHAP process also uses a hash value only one time so that an attacker cannot just \\nmake a copy of the hashed value and send it at a later date. To make that work, the CHAP challenge (the first CHAP message) states a random number. The challenged router runs the hash algorithm using the just-learned random number and the secret password as input, and sends the results back to the router that sent the challenge. The router that sent the challenge runs the same algorithm using the random number (sent across the link) and the password (as stored locally); if the results match, the passwords must match. Later, the next time the authentication process     work occurs, the authenticating router generates and uses a different random number.\\nPAP and CHAP are a few examples of the work done by PPP’s LCP. The next topic looks at \\nhow to configure and verify PPP.\\nImplementing PPP\\nConfiguring PPP, as compared to HDLC, requires     only one change: using the encapsulation ppp command on both ends of the link. As with HDLC, other items can be optionally con-figured, such as the interface bandwidth, and a description of the interface. And of course, the interface must be enabled (no shutdown). But the configuration to migrate from HDLC to PPP just requires the encapsulation ppp command on both routers’ serial interfaces.\\nExample 13-4 shows a simple configuration using the two routers shown in Figure 13-11, \\nthe same internetwork used for the HDLC example. The example includes the IP address configuration, but the IP addresses do not have to be configured for PPP to work.\\nptg17396363344  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 13-4 Basic PPP Configuration\\n!

The output looks just like it does for HDLC up until the first highlighted line in the example. The two highlighted lines confirm the con-figuration (“Encapsulation PPP”). These lines also confirm that LCP has completed its work successfully, as noted with the “LCP Open” phrase. Finally, the output lists the fact that two CPs, CDPCP and IPCP, have also successfully been enabled—all good indications     that PPP is working properly.\\nExample 13-5 Finding PPP, LCP, and NCP Status with show interfaces\\nR1# show interfaces serial 0/0/0\\nSerial0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Hardware is WIC MBRD Serial\\n  Description: link to R2\\n  Internet address is 192.168.2.1/24  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec,\\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation PPP, LCP Open\\n  Open: IPCP, CDPCP, loopback not set! Lines omitted for brevity\\nImplementing PPP CHAP\\nThe simplest version of CHAP       configuration requires only a few commands. The configura-\\ntion uses a password configured on each router. (As an alternative, the password could be configured on an external authentication, authorization, and accounting [AAA] server out-side the router.)\\nTo configure PPP along with CHAP on an interface that has all default configuration on the \\nserial interfaces of both routers, follow these steps:\\nStep 1. Use the encapsulation ppp command   in interface configuration mode, on the \\nserial interfaces on both routers, to enable PPP on the interfaces.\\nStep 2. Define the usernames and passwords used by the two routers:\\nA. Use the hostname name command in global configuration mode on \\neach router, to set the local router’s name to use when authenticating.

Use the username name password password command in global con-\\nfiguration mode on each router, to define the name (case-sensitive) used \\nby the neighboring router, and the matching password (case-sensitive). (The name in the username command should match the name in the neighboring router’s hostname command.)\\nStep 3. Use the ppp authentication chap command   in interface configuration mode on each router to enable CHAP on each interface.\\nFigure 13-15 shows the configuration on both R1 and R2 to both enable PPP and add \\nCHAP to the link. The figure shows how the name in the hostname command on one router \\nmust match the username command on the other router. It also shows           that the password \\ndefined in each username command must be the same (mypass in this case).\\ninterface serial 0/0/0\\n   ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0    encapsulation ppp   ppp authentication chapinterface serial 0/0/1   ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0   encapsulation ppp   ppp authentication chaphostname R1            \\nusername R2 password mypass hostname R2            username R1 password mypass \\nRouter R1 Router R2\\nFigure 13-15 CHAP Configuration\\nYou can confirm that CHAP authentication has succeeded in a couple of ways. First, if \\nCHAP authentication is enabled but CHAP authentication fails, the protocol status of the interface falls to a down state. To check that status, use the usual          show interfaces [type number] command or show interfaces status command. Additionally, if CHAP is enabled but CHAP authentication fails, the show interfaces command does not list “LCP Open” as shown in this example. Example 13-6 lists the output of the show interfaces serial0/0/0 \\ncommand from R1, with CHAP enabled per Figure 13-15, with CHAP working. However, note that this command does not tell us whether authentication has been configured or not. \\nExample 13-6 Confirming CHAP Authentication with show interfaces\\nR1# show interfaces serial 0/0/0\\nSerial0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up \\n  Hardware is WIC MBRD Serial\\n  Description: link to R2\\n  Internet address is 192.168.2.1/24  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec, \\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation PPP, LCP Open\\n  Open: IPCP, CDPCP, loopback not set  Keepalive set (10 sec)\\n!

This command lists a single line per PPP connection in the router. The highlighted header in the example is the column where this command lists various PPP protocols and their status, with a plus sign (+) meaning that the listed protocol is OPEN, and a minus sign (–) meaning that the protocol has failed. The highlighted parts of this command in the example confirm that Serial0/0/0 uses PPP, with CHAP authentication, and       that CHAP authentication worked (as proved by the OPEN status of the CHAP protocol).\\nImplementing PPP PAP\\nPAP configuration differs from CHAP       configuration in a couple of ways. First, PAP uses the similar authentication ppp pap command   instead of the authentication ppp chap com-mand. Then, PAP configures the sent username/password pair much differently than CHAP. A router defines the username/password pair it will send using   the ppp pap sent-username \\ncommand, configured as an interface subcommand. Once sent, the other router receives that username/password pair, and compares those values with its various username password global commands. Figure 13-16 shows a completed configuration for two rout-ers (R1 and R2), with emphasis on matching the ppp pap sent-username command on one router with the username password commands on the other router.\\nR1 Interface Commands R2 Global Commands\\nR2 Interface Commands R1 Global Commandsusername R1 password pass1 \\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n   ip address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.0   encapsulation ppp   ppp authentication pap   ppp pap sent-username R2 password pass2 interface serial 0/0/0   ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0    encapsulation ppp   ppp authentication pap   ppp pap sent-username R1 password pass1\\nusername R2 password pass2 \\nFigure 13-16 PAP Configuration\\nExample 13-7 now shows two commands used to verify PAP operation. In particular, note \\nthat the show interfaces command    tells us nothing more and nothing less as compared to using CHAP authentication. The line protocol status being up confirms that authentication, if configured, worked. (However, nothing in the show interfaces command output tells us whether or not CHAP or PAP has been configured.) As with CHAP, the LCP status of Open also confirms that authentication worked, again assuming authentication is configured. \\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  347\\nHowever, just as is the case when using CHAP, or when using no authentication at all, \\nthis command does not confirm whether authentication has been configured or, if it is configured, which authentication protocol is used. The better confirmation comes from the   show ppp all command at the bottom of the example, which identifies PAP as configured on interface Serial0/0/0, and in this case the protocol is OPEN, meaning        that authentication worked.\\nExample 13-7 Configuring and Verifying PAP Authentication \\nR1# show interfaces serial 0/0/0\\nSerial0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up \\n  Hardware is WIC MBRD Serial\\n  Description: link to R2\\n  Internet address is 192.168.2.1/24  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec, \\n     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation PPP, LCP Open\\n  Open: IPCP, CDPCP, loopback not set  Keepalive set (10 sec)\\n!

You can       configure to try PAP first or CHAP first. Just configure the commands to support both, and add the ppp \\nauthentication pap chap command to try PAP first, or the ppp authentication chap pap command to try CHAP first.\\nImplementing Multilink PPP \\nNetwork designers sometimes use multiple parallel serial links between two routers, rather than a single serial link. That motivation may be to improve availability, so if one link fails, at least the others are working. The motivation may be simple economics—it may be cheap-er to install two or three parallel T1 lines (at about 1.5 Mbps each) rather than move up to the next faster type of line, a T3 line, using a fractional T3 service. Whatever the reasons, you end up with a design that looks like the design in Figure 13-17, with   multiple serial links between two routers.\\n192.168.1.0/24\\n192.168.2.1192.168.9.0/24\\n192.168.2.2\\nS0/0/0 S0/0/1\\n192.168.3.1 192.168.3.2S0/1/1 S0/1/0R1 R2\\nFigure 13-17 Multiple Parallel Serial Links Between Routers\\nptg17396363348  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIf the network engineer configures the parallel serial links as discussed so far in this chapter, \\neach link has IP addresses and can be used to forward IP packets. To make that happen, the interior routing protocol would run over each of the parallel links, with routing protocol neighbor relationships formed over each link. As a result, each router would learn multiple routes to every remote destination subnet—one such route for each parallel link. \\nFigure 13-18 shows the concept of having multiple equal-metric routes, one for each of the \\nparallel serial links. It shows the same design as Figure 13-17, with two links. R1 has one route for network 192.168.9.0/24 over the top link, and one over the bottom link. If using EIGRP, R1 would have two EIGRP neighbor relationships with R2, one over each link.\\n192.168.9.0/24\\n.1\\n.2Two EIGRP Neighbor RelationshipsRoute to 192.168.9.0/24\\nR21\\n2Route to 192.168.9.0/24R1\\nFigure 13-18 Two IP Routes for One Network, One Per Parallel Serial Link\\nThe Layer 3 routing logic in Cisco IOS will then balance packets across the multiple links \\nusing the routes as shown in the figure. By default, IOS balances on a destination-by-destination address basis—for instance, in Figure 13-18, all packets to 192.168.9.1 might flow over the top link, with all packets going to destination address 192.168.9.2 being routed over the lower link. IOS can be configured to balance on a packet-by-packet basis.\\nUsing the Layer 3 features discussed in the last page or so works, and works well in many \\ncases. However, PPP offers a feature that simplifies the Layer 3 operations in topologies that use multiple parallel PPP links, with a feature called Multilink PPP (MLPPP).\\nMultilink PPP Concepts\\nMultilink PPP (MLPPP) is a PPP feature     useful when using multiple parallel serial links between two devices. It provides two important features. First, it reduces the Layer 3 com-plexity by making the multiple serial interfaces on each router look like a single interface from a Layer 3 perspective. Instead of multiple subnets between routers, with multiple routing protocol neighbor relationships, and multiple equal-metric routes learned for each remote subnet, routers would have one subnet between routers, one routing protocol neigh-bor relationship, and one route per destination subnet. Figure 13-19 shows these main ideas for the same physical    topology shown in Figure 13-18, which has multiple physical links.\\n192.168.1.0/24\\n192.168.5.1192.168.9.0/24\\n192.168.5.2\\nMultilink 1 Multilink 1\\nR1 R2\\nEIGRP NeighborsOnly Route to 192.168.9.0/24\\nFigure 13-19 Layer 3 Concept Created by Multilink Interface\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  349\\nMLPPP makes the multiple physical links work like a single link by using a virtual interface \\ncalled a multilink interface. The Layer 3 configuration (like IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routing protocol interface subcommands) is added to the multilink interface. Then the con-figuration associates the physical serial interfaces      with the multilink interface, connecting the Layer 2 logic that works with the multiple serial links with the Layer 3 logic that works on the single multilink interface.\\nIn addition to simplifying Layer 3 details as just described, MLPPP balances the frames \\nsent at Layer 2 over the multiple links. With MLPPP, a router’s Layer 3 forwarding logic forwards each packet out the multilink interface. When    IOS internally routes a packet out a multilink interface, MLPPP load-balancing logic takes over, encapsulating the packet into a new data link frame, and load balancing the frame.\\nInterestingly, MLPPP load balances the data link frame by fragmenting the frame into mul-\\ntiple smaller frames, one per active link, as shown with the process in Figure 13-20. Steps 1 and 2 show normal routing, with an encapsulated IP packet arriving at Step 1, and the router making the usual routing decision at Step 2. However, with the packet exiting a multilink interface, MLPPP fragments the packet into pieces (called fragments), with a PPP header/trailer around each, with a few extra header bytes to manage the fragmentation process. The receiving router reassembles the fragments back into the original packet (Step 4), with nor-mal IP routing shown at Step 5.\\nR1 R21\\nIP5\\nIP\\n33 2 4PPP IP\\nPPP IP\\nFigure 13-20 Layer 2 Fragmentation to Balance Traffic over Multiple Links\\nMLPPP’s load-balancing process    allows for some small variations in the sizes of the frag-ments, but for the most part, Cisco routers will balance the bytes sent equally across the active links in the multilink bundle. For instance, if three links are active, the router for-wards about one-third of the byte volume of traffic.\\nConfiguring MLPPP\\nImplementing MLPPP requires a longer    configuration than most features discussed in this book. So first, to set the context a bit, think about these main three configuration require-ments for MLPPP: \\nStep 1. Configure matching multilink interfaces on the two routers, configuring the \\ninterface subcommands for all Layer 3 features (IPv4, IPv6, and routing proto-col) under the multilink interfaces (and not on the serial interfaces).\\nStep 2. Configure the serial interfaces with all Layer 1 and 2 commands, like     clock rate (Layer 1) and ppp authentication (Layer 2).\\nStep 3. Configure some PPP commands on both the multilink and serial interfaces, to both enable MLPPP and associate the multilink interface with the serial inter-faces.\\nptg17396363350  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 13-21 shows all the specific MLPPP commands in a working example. The example \\nis based on the design in Figures 13-19 and 13-20. Note that for space, Figure 13-21 shows the configuration for only one of the two serial interfaces, but all serial interfaces would have the same subcommands when used for MLPPP. \\nFirst, focus on the six configuration commands noted with white highlight boxes in Figure \\n13-21 as pointed to with arrows. The interface multilink 1 command   on each router creates the multilink interface on that router. The network engineer chooses the interface number, but the number must be the same on both routers, or the link will not work. Additionally, the multilink interfaces and the physical serial interfaces must all have both   a ppp multilink group 1 command, and they must all again refer to that same number (1 in this example). Any number in range could be used, but the number must match with the commands high-lighted in the figure.\\nR1 Multilink (Layer 3) Interface R2 Multilink (Layer 3) Interface\\nR1 Layer 2 Interfaces R2 Layer 2 Interfacesinterface multilink 1\\n   encapsulation ppp   ppp multilink   ip address 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.0   ppp multilink group 1interface multilink 1   encapsulation ppp   ppp multilink   ip address 192.168.5.2 255.255.255.0   ppp multilink group 1\\nMust Be Same Numberinterface Serial0/0/0   encapsulation ppp   ppp multilink   no ip address   ppp multilink group 1   !

Authentication goes here\\nFigure 13-21 MLPPP Configuration\\nNow look at   the ip address commands. Note that the configuration shows IPv4 addresses \\nconfigured on the multilink interfaces, but no IPv4 address at all on the serial interface. In short, the multilink interface has the Layer 3 configuration, and the serial interfaces do not. As a result, the routing and routing protocol logic will work with the multilink interface.\\nFinally, note that both the multilink and serial interfaces have two additional commands: \\nencapsulation ppp (which enables PPP), and ppp multilink (which        adds multilink support).\\nNOTE Figure 13-21 shows only one serial interface, but each serial interface in the multi-link group would need the same configuration.\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  351\\nVerifying MLPPP\\nTo verify that an MLPPP interface is working, it helps    to think about the Layer 3 features \\nseparately from Layer 1 and Layer 2 details. For Layer 3, all the usual IPv4, IPv6, and rout-ing protocol commands will now list the multilink interface rather than the physical serial interfaces. You can also just ping the IP address on the other end of the multilink to test the link. Example 13-8 shows a few commands to confirm the current working state of the MLPPP link, taken from the working configuration in Figure 13-21. \\nExample 13-8 Verifying Layer 3 Operations with an MLPPP Multilink Interface\\nR1# show ip route\\n!

However, the two serial interfaces are not listed at all, because they do not have IP addresses and the router’s rout-ing logic works with the multilink interface instead. Similarly, the show ip eigrp interfaces \\nptg17396363352  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ncommand   lists interfaces on which EIGRP is enabled, listing Mu1 (Multilink 1), and not list-\\ning either of the two serial interfaces in the MLPPP bundle. Finally, note that the   show ip \\ninterface brief command does list both the serial interfaces and the multilink interface, but the output confirms that no IP address has been configured on the serial interfaces, as noted with the “unassigned” text under the IP-Address column.\\nEach multilink interface has a line and protocol status like any other interface, and if that \\nstatus is up/up, IOS believes the multilink interface is working. By default, that working state implies that at least one of the physical links in the MLPPP group is also working—that is, some of the physical links can fail, and the multilink stays up. You can always direct-ly verify the serial interfaces in the multilink group with the same commands discussed earlier in the chapter (show controllers, show interfaces). Additionally, the two commands \\nin Example 13-9        give some insight into the specifics of MLPPP operation.\\nExample 13-9 Verifying Operational Details of an MLPPP Group\\nR1# show interfaces multilink 1\\nMultilink1 is up, line protocol is up \\n  Hardware is multilink group interface\\n  Internet address is 192.168.5.1/24\\n  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 3088 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec,      reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation PPP, LCP Open, multilink Open\\n  Open: IPCP, CDPCP, loopback not set\\n  Keepalive set (10 sec) ! lines omitted for brevity\\nR1# show ppp multilink \\nMultilink1\\n  Bundle name: R2\\n  Remote Username: R2\\n  Remote Endpoint Discriminator: [1] R2  Local Username: R1\\n  Local Endpoint Discriminator: [1] R1\\n  Bundle up for 16:50:33, total bandwidth 3088, load 1/255\\n  Receive buffer limit 24000 bytes, frag timeout 1000 ms    0/0 fragments/bytes in reassembly list\\n    0 lost fragments, 96 reordered\\n    0/0 discarded fragments/bytes, 0 lost received\\n    0x654D7 received sequence, 0x654D5 sent sequence  Member links: 2 active, 0 inactive (max 255, min not set)\\n    Se0/1/1, since 16:50:33\\n    Se0/0/0, since 16:23:16\\nNo inactive multilink interfaces\\nFirst, notice that the show interfaces multilink 1 command lists many familiar details and \\nsome mentions about multilink. In particular, the output shows the traditional line and \\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  353\\nprotocol status, both in an up state, meaning that the interface is working. On the sixth line, \\nthe output mentioned a working multilink state of “Open” in the section about PPP control protocols, confirming that MLPPP is in effect. \\nFinally, the output of the show ppp multilink command   identifies the links configured in \\neach multilink bundle, as well as which ones are active. In this case, on R1, interfaces S0/0/0 and S0/1/1 are active, as highlighted at the bottom of the example. The timer to the side shows that both have been active a little over 16 hours. Seeing these two interfaces in the list confirms not only that the physical interfaces are working, but that the MLPPP configu-ration    includes both of these links in multilink group 1. \\nTroubleshooting Serial Links\\nThis final major section discusses how to isolate and find the root cause of problems related to topics covered earlier in this chapter. Also, this section does not attempt to repeat the IP troubleshooting coverage in Part II of this book, but it does point out some of the possible symptoms on a serial link when a Layer 3 subnet mismatch occurs on opposite ends of a serial link, which prevents the routers from routing packets over the serial link.\\nA simple ping command can determine      whether a serial link can or cannot forward IP \\npackets. A ping of the other router’s serial IP address—for example, a working ping \\n192.168.2.2 command on R1 in Figure 13-11, the figure used for both the HDLC and PPP configuration examples—proves that the link either works or does not.\\nIf the ping does not work, the problem could be related to functions at Layer 1, 2, or 3. The \\nbest way to isolate which layer is the most likely cause is to examine   the interface status codes described in Table 13-5.\\nTable 13-5 Interface Status Codes and T ypical Meanings When a Ping Does Not Work\\nLine Status Protocol Status Likely General Reason/Layer\\nAdministratively down Down Interface shutdown\\nDown Down Layer 1\\nUp Down Layer 2\\nUp Up Layer 3\\nThe serial link verification and troubleshooting process should begin with a simple three-step process:\\nStep 1. From one router, ping the other router’s serial IP address.\\nStep 2. If the ping fails, examine the interface status on both routers and investigate \\nproblems related to the likely problem areas listed in Table 13-5.\\nStep 3. If the ping works, also verify that any routing protocols are exchanging routes over the link, as discussed in Chapter 11, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols.”\\nNOTE The interface status codes can be found using the show interfaces, show ip \\ninterface brief, and show interfaces description commands.\\nptg17396363354  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe rest of this section explores the specific items to be examined when the ping fails, \\nbased on the combinations of interface status codes    listed in Table 13-5.\\nTroubleshooting Layer 1 Problems\\nThe interface status codes, or interface state, play a key role in isolating the root cause of problems on serial links. In fact, the status on both ends of the link may differ, so it is important to examine the status on both ends of the link to help determine     the problem.\\nFor example, a serial link fails when just one of the two routers has administratively disabled \\nits serial interface with the     shutdown interface subcommand. When one router shuts down \\nits serial interface, the other router sits in a down/down state (line status down, line proto-col status down), assuming the second router’s interface is not also shut down. The solution is to just configure a no shutdown interface configuration command on the interface.\\nA serial interface with a down line status   on both ends of the serial link—that is, both ends \\nin a down/down state—usually points to some Layer 1 problem. Figure 13-22 summarizes the most common causes of this state. In the figure, R2’s serial interface has no problems at all; the center and left side of the figure show common root causes that then result in R2’s serial interface being in a down/down state.\\nCSUTELCO Facilities ProblemBad Cable, Unplugged Cable\\nR1 R2\\nLine: Down\\nProtocol: DownCSUInterface\\nShutdown\\nS0/0/0 S0/0/1Misconfigured or Broken CSU\\nFigure 13-22 Problems That Result in a Down/Down State on Router R2\\nTroubleshooting Layer 2 Problems\\nData link layer problems on serial links usually     result in at least one of the routers having a serial interface status of up/down. In other words, the line status (the first status code) is up, while the second status (the line protocol status) is down. Table 13-6 lists some of these types of problems.\\nTable 13-6 Likely Reasons for Data Link Problems on Serial Links\\nLine Status Protocol Status Likely Reason\\nUp Down on both ends1Mismatched encapsulation commands\\nUp Down on one end, up on \\nthe otherKeepalive disabled on the end in an up state when using HDLC\\nUp Down on both ends PAP/CHAP authentication failure\\n1 In this case, the state may flap from up/up, to up/down, to up/up, and so on, while the router keeps trying \\nto make the encapsulation work.\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  355\\nThe first of these problems—a mismatch between the configured data link protocols—is \\neasy to identify and fix. The show interfaces command lists the encapsulation type on about the seventh line of the output, so using this command on both routers can quickly identify the problem. Alternatively, a quick look at the configuration, plus remembering that HDLC is the default serial encapsulation, can confirm whether the encapsulations are mismatched. The solution is simple: Reconfigure one of the two routers to match the other router’s encapsulation command.\\nThe other two root causes require a little more discussion to understand the issue and deter-mine if they are the real root cause. The next two sections     take a closer look at each.\\nKeepalive Failure\\nThe router keepalive feature helps    a router notice when a link is no longer functioning. Once a router believes the link no longer works, the router can bring down the interface, allowing the routing protocol to converge to use other routes it they exist.\\nThe keepalive function on an interface causes routers to send keepalive messages to each \\nother every keepalive interval, defaulting to 10 seconds. For instance, on a serial link between R1 and R2, R1 sends a keepalive message every 10 seconds, and R2 expects to receive those keepalive messages every 10 seconds. If R2 fails to receive the keepalive mes-sages for a set number of consecutive keepalive intervals (usually three or five intervals), R2 believes R1 has failed, and R2 changes the link to an up/down state. The keepalive process happens in both directions as well—R1 sends keepalives with R2 expecting to receive them, and R2 sends keepalives with R1 expecting to receive them.\\nA keepalive mismatch occurs when one router has keepalives enabled and one router does \\nnot. That combination is a mistake, and should not be used. Note that this keepalive mis-match mistake only breaks HDLC links; the PPP keepalive feature prevents the problem. Figure 13-23 shows one such example with HDLC and with R1 mistakenly disabling keep-alives.\\n192.168.2.2192.168.2.1\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1 R1 R2interface serial 0/0/1\\n encapsulation hdlc\\nLine: Up\\nProtocol: DownLine: Up\\nProtocol: Upinterface serial 0/0/0\\nencapsulation hdlcno keepalive\\nFigure 13-23 Results when Using HDLC with a Keepalive Mismatch\\nNote that the router interface that disables keepalives remains in an up/up state. In the sce-\\nnario shown in Figure 13-23, R2’s interface fails because\\n■R1 does not send keepalive messages, because keepalives are disabled.\\n■R2 still expects to receive keepalive messages, because keepalives are enabled.\\nYou can verify the keepalive setting by looking at the configuration or by using the show \\ninterfaces command. The examples in this chapter list several examples of the show \\ninterfaces command that happen to list the text “Keepalive set (10 second),” meaning    that keepalives are enabled with a 10-second interval. R1 would list the text “Keepalive not set” in this case. \\nptg17396363356  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPAP and CHAP Authentication Failure\\nAs mentioned earlier, a failure in the PAP/CHAP authentication             process results in both \\nrouter interfaces failing to an up and down state. As shown in Examples 13-6 and 13-7, you can use the show interfaces and show ppp all commands to look further into the status of the PPP authentication process. By doing so, you can isolate and discover the root cause of why the interface is in an up/down state, ruling out or ruling in PPP authentication as the root cause.\\nAnother deeper method to troubleshoot PPP authentication problems   uses the debug ppp \\nauthentication command. \\nCHAP uses a three-message exchange, as shown back in Figure 13-14, with a set of mes-\\nsages flowing for authentication in each direction by default. If you enable the debug, shut down the link, and bring it back up, you will see debug messages that  match that three-way exchange. If authentication fails, you see a failure message at the point at which the process fails, which may help you decide what specifically needs to be fixed.\\nExample 13-10 shows the three related debug messages when a link comes up. The network \\nconnects R1’s S0/0/0 to router R2. The example extracts the three related debug messages from what would be a few dozen debug messages, so you would have to look for these. However, the output highlights the important parts of the process as seen back in     Figure 13-14, as follows:\\n1. The “O” refers to output, meaning that this local router, R1, has output (sent) a\\nChallenge message. Note the “from R1” at the end of the debug message, stating who\\nthe message is from.\\n2. The “I” refers to input, meaning that this local router, R1, has input (received) a\\nResponse message. Note the “from R2” at the end of the line.\\n3. The “O FAILURE” refers to R1 sending out a Failure message, telling R2 that the\\nauthentication process failed.\\nExample 13-10 Debug Messages on Router R1 Confirming the Failure of CHAP\\nR1# debug ppp authentication\\nPPP authentication debugging is on\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\n*Nov 18 23:45:48.820: Se0/0/0 CHAP: O CHALLENGE id 1 len 23 from \"R1\"\\n*Nov 18 23:45:48.820: Se0/0/0 CHAP: I RESPONSE id 1 len 23 from \"R2\"*Nov 18 23:45:48.820: Se0/0/0 CHAP: O FAILURE id 1 len 25 msg is \"Authentication\\n  failed\"\\nWhile using a debug command may tell us something about the problem, it does not always \\npoint to the specific command that is misconfigured. In this case, the fact that both rout-ers send at least one CHAP message implies that both router interfaces can send frames, and that they have enabled CHAP. It looks more like R1 has rejected the hashed password supplied by R2. Note that this example was built by changing the username command to have an                 incorrect password, so that the CHAP process worked but the authentication was rejected.\\nptg1739636313Chapter 13: Implementing Point-to-Point WANs  357\\nTroubleshooting Layer 3 Problems\\nThis chapter suggests that the best starting place     to troubleshoot serial links is to ping the \\nIP address of the router on the other end of the link—specifically, the IP address on the serial link. Interestingly, the serial link can be in an up and up state but the ping can still fail because of Layer 3 misconfiguration. In some cases, the ping may work but the routing protocols might not be able to exchange routes. This short section examines the symptoms, which differ slightly depending on whether HDLC or PPP is used and the root cause.\\nFirst, consider an HDLC link on which the physical and data link details are working fine. \\nIn this case, both routers’ interfaces are in an up and up state. However, if the IP addresses configured on the serial interfaces on the two routers are in different subnets, a ping to the IP address on the other end of the link will fail because the routers do not have a matching route. For example, consider an example with a working HDLC link with the IP addresses shown earlier in Figure 13-23. Then, if R1’s serial IP address remained 192.168.2.1, and R2’s was changed to 192.168.3.2 (instead of 192.168.2.2), still with a mask of /24, the two rout-ers would have connected routes to different subnets. They would not have a route match-ing the opposite router’s serial IP address.\\nFinding and fixing a mismatched subnet problem with HDLC links is relatively simple. You \\ncan find the problem by doing the usual first step of pinging the IP address on the other end of the link and failing. If both interfaces have a status of up/up, the problem is likely this mismatched IP subnet.\\nFor PPP links with the same IP address/mask misconfiguration, the ping to the other router’s \\nIP address actually works. However, the IP subnet mismatch still prevents EIGRP and OSPF neighbor relationships from forming, so it is still a good idea to follow the rules and put both serial interface IP addresses in the same subnet.\\nPPP makes the ping work with the mismatched subnet by adding a host route, with a /32 \\nprefix length, for the IP address of the other router. Example 13-11 shows the working PPP link with addresses in different subnets.\\nNOTE A route with a /32 prefix, representing a single host, is called   a host route.\\nExample 13-11 PPP Allowing a Ping over a Serial Link, Even with Mismatched Subnets\\nR1# show ip route\\n!

R1 thinks this subnet is the subnet connected to S0/0/0 because of R1’s configured IP address (192.168.2.1/24). The second highlighted line shows the host route created by PPP, specifically for R2’s new serial IP address (192.168.3.2). (R2 will have a similar route for 192.168.2.1/32, R1’s serial IP address.) So, both routers have a route to allow them to forward packets to the IP address on the other end of the link, even though the other router’s address is in a different subnet. This extra host route allows the ping to the other     side of the serial link to work in spite of the addresses on each end being in different subnets.\\nTable 13-7 summarizes the behavior on HDLC and PPP     links when the IP addresses on each \\nend do not reside in the same subnet but no other problems exist.\\nTable 13-7 Summary of Symptoms for Mismatched Subnets on Serial Links\\nSymptoms When IP Addresses on a Serial Link Are in Different \\nSubnetsHDLC PPP\\nDoes a ping of the other router’s serial IP address work?

As usual for this book’s discussion of WAN services, the service is viewed mostly from the perspective of the enterprise, as the customer of some    WAN service provider (SP). That means the discussion focuses on what the enterprise receives from the service, rather than how the service provider imple-ments the service inside its network. (Note that Cisco’s Service Provider certification track explores the details of how an SP implements its network.)\\nThis chapter reflects probably the biggest single change to what Cisco includes for WAN \\ntopics in the CCNA R&S certification for the entire history of the certification. Cisco intro-duced the CCNA certification back in 1998 (now called CCNA Routing and Switching). At that time, Frame Relay was the dominant   WAN technology, and leased lines, an older tech-nology, were still used. Cisco has included both leased lines and Frame Relay in CCNA R&S for the certification’s entire history until the release of new exams in 2016, with the CCNA 200-125 exam (which is sometimes referenced by Cisco as CCNA v3.0). Frame Relay is not mentioned at all in the current exam topics, although serial links do still get a brief mention because of some related data link protocols. \\nCisco replaces Frame Relay in the exam topics with two notable WAN technologies more \\ncommonly used today: Metro Ethernet and MPLS. For perspective, Figure 14-1 shows a timeline of approximately when some of the more common private WAN services entered the marketplace.\\nThis chapter begins with Metro Ethernet in the first major section, followed by MPLS VPNs \\nin the second, even though MPLS VPNs came first historically. Introducing Metro Ethernet first should be easier to learn, given the many similarities between using Ethernet in the LAN and using Ethernet in the WAN. \\nptg173963632010Digital\\nLeased LinesX.25 Packet\\nSwitchingFrame\\nRelay\\n1960 1970 1980 1990 2000MPLS\\nVPNsMetro\\nEthernet\\nFigure 14-1 General Timeline of Entering the Market for Some Private WAN Services\\nNOTE For those of you interested in reading about the old Frame Relay topics, the previ-\\nous edition’s two chapters about Frame Relay are included with this book, as Appendixes H and I.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

Second, the service is a Layer 2 service in that the WAN provider forwards Ethernet frames from one customer device to another. \\nTo begin the conversation with a basic view, Metro Ethernet acts much as if the WAN ser-\\nvice were created by one Ethernet switch, as shown in Figure 14-2. The figure shows four sites in the same company, each with a router. Each router is connected to the WAN ser-vice with an Ethernet link of some kind; those Ethernet links typically use one of the fiber Ethernet standards due to the distances involved. From the customer’s perspective (that is, from the perspective of the enterprise that is the customer of the WAN SP), the WAN ser-vice acts like a LAN switch in that it forwards Ethernet frames.\\nNOTE Throughout this chapter, the word \\ncustomer  refers to the customer of the service \\nprovider; that is, the enterprise that is purchasing the WAN service.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  365\\nR1 R3\\nR2 R4Layer\\n2SW1Customer Router\\nCustomer RouterCustomer RouterCustomer RouterMetro Ethernet WAN Service\\nFigure 14-2 Metro Ethernet Concept as a Large Ethernet Switch\\nAlthough the main concept makes a Metro Ethernet service act like a big LAN switch, there \\nare many options, and you should understand the basics of each. Additionally, many cus-tomers connect to a Metro Ethernet service with either routers or Layer 3 switches, which brings up some Layer 3 issues with IP addressing and routing protocols. This section closes with a discussion of the Layer 3 issues.\\nMetro Ethernet Physical Design and Topology\\nFrom an enterprise perspective, to use a Metro Ethernet service, each site needs to connect to the service with (at least) one Ethernet link. There is no need to connect each enter-prise router to each other enterprise router directly      with a physical link. For instance, in Figure 14-2 in the previous section, each of the four enterprise routers connects to the SP’s MetroE service with one physical Ethernet link, rather than connecting directly to the other enterprise routers. \\nFrom the SP perspective, the SP needs to build a network to create the Metro Ethernet \\nservice. To keep costs lower the SP puts a device (typically an Ethernet switch) physically near to as many customer sites as possible, in an SP facility called  a \\npoint of presence  \\n(PoP). Those SP switches need to be near enough to many customer locations so that some Ethernet standard supports the distance from the SP’s PoP to each customer site. Figure 14-3 collects some of these terms and ideas together. \\nWorking through the details in the figure, the physical link between the customer and the \\nSP is called an \\naccess link  or, when       using Ethernet specifically, an Ethernet access link . \\nEverything that happens on that link falls within the definition of the   user network inter-\\nface , or UNI. Breaking down the term UNI, the word network refers to the SP’s network, \\nwhile the SP’s customer (the enterprise) is known as the user of the network. \\nFocusing on the center of Figure 14-3, the SP’s network remains hidden to a great extent. The SP promises to deliver Ethernet frames across the WAN. To do that, the access links connect to an Ethernet switch. As you can imagine, the switch will look at the Ethernet header’s MAC address fields and at 802.1Q trunking headers for VLAN tags, but the      details inside the network remain hidden. \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B, C 2 A 3 A, D 4 B, C 5 D 6 A\\nptg17396363366  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nUNIUser Network\\nEthernet\\nUNIAccess LinkAccess LinkR1\\nR3Access Link\\nUNIR2Ethernet\\nEthernetSP Network -\\nDetails Hidden\\nLocated in SP\\nPoint of Presence (PoP)\\nDistances Set\\nby Ethernet Standards\\nFigure 14-3 Ethernet Access Links into a Metro Ethernet Service\\nNOTE The term carrier Ethernet , meaning   Ethernet WAN service provider by a carrier \\n(that is, service provider) is also used instead of Metro Ethernet. Metro Ethernet began \\nas a technology used to create networks in metropolitan areas of cities (generically called metropolitan-area networks, or MANs), so the name Metro Ethernet made more sense. Carrier Ethernet is a better name today, because it is not limited to a single city.\\nThe UNI references a variety of standards, including the fact that any IEEE Ethernet stan-dard can be used for the access link. Table 14-2 lists some of the standards you might expect to see used as Ethernet access links, given their support of longer distances           than the standards that use UTP cabling. \\nTable 14-2 IEEE Ethernet Standards Useful for Metro Ethernet Access\\nName Speed Distance\\n100Base-LX10 100 Mbps 10 Km\\n1000Base-LX 1 Gbps 5 Km\\n1000Base-LX10 1 Gbps 10 Km\\n1000Base-ZX 1 Gbps 100 Km\\n10GBase-LR 10 Gbps 10 Km\\n10GBase-ER 10 Gbps 40 Km\\nEthernet WAN Services and Topologies\\nBeyond adding a physical Ethernet connection      from each site into the SP’s Metro Ethernet WAN service, the enterprise must choose between several possible variations of MetroE services. Those variations use different topologies that meet different customer needs. \\nMEF (http://www.mef.net) defines the standards for Metro Ethernet, including the specifi-\\ncations for different kinds      of MetroE services. Table 14-3 lists three service types described in this chapter, and their topologies. The next few pages after the table go into more depth about each.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  367\\nTable 14-3 Three MEF Service Types and Their T opologies \\nMEF Service \\nNameMEF Short NameTopology Terms Description\\nEthernet Line ServiceE-Line Point-to-point Two cust omer premise e quipment (CPE) \\ndevices can exchange Ethernet frames, similar in concept to a leased line.\\nEthernet LAN ServiceE-LAN Full mesh Acts like a LAN, in that all devices can send frames to all other devices.\\nEthernet Tree ServiceE-Tree Hub-and-spoke; \\npartial mesh; point-to-multipointA central site can communicate to a defined set of remote sites, but the remote sites cannot communicate directly.\\nNOTE You may see the term     Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) used for what MEF \\ndefines as E-Line service, and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) used for what MEF \\ndefines as E-LAN service. You might also see the term Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS). All \\nthese terms refer to cases in which the SP uses MPLS internally to create what the customer sees as an Ethernet WAN service.\\nEthernet Line Service (Point-to-Point)\\nThe Ethernet Line Service, or E-Line, is the simplest            of the Metro Ethernet services. The customer connects two sites with access links. Then the MetroE service allows the two cus-tomer devices to send Ethernet frames to each other. Figure 14-4 shows an example, with routers as the CPE devices.\\nMetro Ethernet\\nR1 R2 Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC)\\nFigure 14-4 Point-point Topology in Metro Ethernet E-Line Service Between Routers\\nAs with all MetroE services, the promise made by the service is to deliver Ethernet frames across the service, as if the two customer routers had a rather long crossover cable con-nected between them. In fact, the E-Line service is the same Ethernet WAN service you have already seen in many examples throughout the ICND1 Cert Guide and in this book. For instance, in this case:\\n■The routers would use physical Ethernet interfaces.\\n■The routers would configure IP addresses in the same subnet as each other.\\n■Their routing protocols would become neighbors and exchange routes.\\nThe MetroE specifications define the concept of an   Ethernet Virtual Connection , or \\nEVC, to define which user (customer) devices can communicate with which. By definition, an E-Line service (as shown in Figure 14-4) creates a point-to-point EVC, meaning that the service allows two endpoints to communicate.\\nptg17396363368  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIt may be that an enterprise wants to implement a network exactly as shown in Figure 14-4, \\nwith two sites and two routers, with MetroE WAN connectivity            using an E-Line service. Other variations exist, even other variations using an E-Line.\\nFor example, think of a common enterprise WAN topology with a central site and 100 \\nremote sites. As shown so far, with an E-Line service, the central site router would need 100 Ethernet interfaces to connect to those 100 remote sites. That could be expensive. As an alternative, the enterprise could use the design partially shown in Figure 14-5 (just three remote sites shown). In this case:\\n■The central site router uses a single 10-Gbps access link.\\n■The central site connects to 100 E-Lines (only three shown).\\n■All the E-Lines send and receive frames over the same access link.\\nR2\\nR1 R3\\nR4\\nThree Different E-linesOne 10 Gbps\\nAccess Link\\nFigure 14-5 Using Multiple E-Lines, One for Each Remote Site\\nNote that this chapter does not get into the configuration details for WAN services. However, designs like Figure 14-5, with multiple E-Line services on a single access link, use 802.1Q trunking, with a different VLAN ID for each E-Line service. As a result, the router configuration can use a typical router configuration with trunking and subinterfaces.\\nBefore moving on to the next MetroE service, note that the customer could use switches \\ninstead of routers to connect to the WAN. Historically, enterprise engineers place routers at the edge of a WAN, in part because that device connected to both the WAN and the LAN, and the LAN and WAN used different types of physical interfaces and different data link protocols. As a result of how routing works, routers served as the perfect device to sit at the edge between LAN and WAN (called the WAN edge). With MetroE, the LAN and WAN            are both Ethernet, so an Ethernet switch becomes an option. \\nEthernet LAN Service (Full Mesh)\\nImagine an enterprise needs to connect several            sites to a WAN, and the goal is to allow every site to send frames directly to every other site. You could do that with E-Lines, but you would need possibly lots of E-Lines. For instance, to connect three sites with E-Lines so that each site could send frames directly to each other, you only need three E-Lines. But with four, five, and six sites, you would need 6, 10, and 15 E-Lines, respectively. Get up to 20 sites for which all could send frames directly to each other, and you would need 190 E-Lines. (The formula is N(N – 1) / 2.)\\nThe people who created MetroE anticipated the need for designs that allow a full mesh—\\nthat is, for each pair of nodes in the service to send frames to each other directly. In fact, \\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  369\\nallowing all devices to send directly to every other device sounds a lot like an Ethernet \\nLAN, so the MetroE service is called an Ethernet LAN service , or E-LAN.\\nOne E-LAN service allows all devices connected to that service to send Ethernet frames directly to every other device, just as if the Ethernet WAN service were one big Ethernet switch. Figure 14-6 shows a representation of a single E-LAN EVC. In this case, the one EVC connects to four customer sites, creating one E-LAN. Routers R1, R2, R3, and R4 can all send frames directly to each other. They would also all be in the same Layer 3 subnet on the WAN. \\nR1 R2\\nR3 R4\\nFigure 14-6 MetroE Ethernet LAN Service—Any-to-Any Forwarding over the Service\\nAn E-LAN service connects the sites in a full mesh. The term full mesh refers to a design \\nthat, for a set of devices, creates a direct communication path for each pair. In contrast, a partial            mesh refers to a design in which only some of the pairs can communicate directly. Ethernet Tree service (E-Trees), as discussed in the next topic, create a partial mesh design.\\nEthernet Tree Service (Hub and Spoke)\\nThe Ethernet Tree service (E-Tree) creates            a WAN topology in which the central site device can send Ethernet frames directly to each remote (leaf) site, but the remote (leaf) sites can send only to the central site. Figure 14-7 shows the topology, again with a single EVC. In this case, Router R1 is the root site, and can send to all three remote sites. Routers R2, R3, and R4 can send only to R1. \\nR2\\nR1 R3\\nR4E-Tree RootE-Tree Leaves\\nFigure 14-7 E-Tree Service Creates a Hub-and-Spoke Topology\\nWith an E-Tree, the central site serves as the root of a tree, and each remote site as one of the leaves. The topology goes by many names: partial mesh, hub-and-spoke, and point-to-multipoint. Regardless of the term you use, an E-Tree service creates a service that works well for            designs with a central site plus many remote sites. \\nptg17396363370  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nLayer 3 Design Using Metro Ethernet\\nNow that you know the basics of the E-Line (point-to-point), E-LAN (full mesh), and E-Tree \\n(point-to-multipoint, hub-and-spoke) services, this next topic reviews some Layer 3 design details when using each of these three services. That is, if the enterprise uses routers or Layer 3 switches as its WAN edge devices, how should the engineer plan for IP addresses and subnets? What is the impact on routing protocols? This section      answers those ques-tions.\\nNote that this section uses routers as the enterprise’s devices, but the concepts apply to \\nLayer 3 switches as well.\\nLayer 3 Design with E-Line Service\\nEvery E-Line uses a point-to-point topology. As a result, the two routers on the ends of an E-Line need to be in the same subnet. Similarly, when an enterprise uses multiple E-Lines, each           should be in a different subnet. As an example, consider Figure 14-8, which shows two E-Lines, both of which connect to Router R1 on the left.  \\nR2\\nR1 R3\\nTwo E-Lines (Point-to-Point)\\nFigure 14-8 Routing Protocol Neighbor Relationships over Metro Ethernet E-Line\\nFocusing on the E-Lines, and ignoring the access links for the most part, think of each E-Line as a subnet. Each router needs an IP address in each subnet, and the subnets need to be unique. All the addresses come from the enterprise’s IP address space. Figure 14-9 shows an example of the addresses, subnets, and two OSPF-learned routes in the routing table of R3.\\n.1R2\\nR1 R310.1.1.0/2410.1.2.0/24\\nSubnet 10.1.12.0 /24\\nSubnet\\n10.1.1.0/2410.1.2.0/2410.1.12.0/2410.1.3.0/2410.1.13.0/24InterfaceG0/1.13G0/1.13G0/1.13G0/2G0/1.13R3 Routing Table\\nNext-hop10.1.13.110.1.13.110.1.13.1N/AN/A.1\\n.3.2\\nG0/1.13 Subnet 10.1.13.0 /24\\n10.1.3.0/24Next-Hop for Routes\\nCode\\nOOOCCG0/2\\nFigure 14-9 Layer 3 Forwarding Between Remote Sites—Through Central Site\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  371\\nExamine the IP routing table in the lower right of the figure, first focusing on the route to \\nsubnet 10.1.1.0/24, which is the LAN subnet off Router R1. R3’s route points to a next-hop router IP address that is R1’s IP address on the Ethernet WAN, specifically the address on the other side of the E-Line that connects R1 and R3. This route should not be a surprise: For R3 to send packets to a subnet connected to R1, R3 sends the packets to R1. Also, it happens to use a subinterface (G0/1.13), which means that the design is using 802.1Q trunk-ing on the link.\\nNext, look at R3’s route for subnet 10.1.2.0/24, which supports the fact that R3 cannot \\nsend packets directly to R2 with the current WAN design. R3 does not have an E-Line that allows R3 to send frames directly to R2. R3 will not become routing protocol neigh-bors with R2 either. So, R3 will learn its route for subnet 10.1.2.0/24 from R1, with R1’s 10.1.13.1 address as the next-hop address. As a result, when forwarding packets, R3 will           for-ward packets to R1, which will then forward them over the other E-Line to R2.\\nLayer 3 Design with E-LAN Service\\nIf you connected four routers to one LAN switch, all in the same VLAN, what would you expect for the IP addresses on those routers? And if all           four routers used the same routing protocol, which would become neighbors? Typically, with four routers connected to the same switch, on the same VLAN, using the same routing protocol, normally all four routers would have IP addresses in the same subnet, and all would become neighbors.\\nOn an E-LAN service, the same IP addressing design is used, with the same kinds of rout-\\ning protocol neighbor relationships. Figure 14-10 shows an example that includes subnets and addresses, plus one route as an example. Note that the four routers connected to the E-LAN service in the center all have addresses in subnet 10.1.99.0/24.\\n10.1.1.0/24 10.1.2.0/24 .1\\n.4.2\\n.3\\nG0/1.99Subnet  10.1.99.0 /24\\n10.1.3.0/24 10.1.4.0/24\\nSubnet\\n10.1.2.0/2410.1.1.0/2410.1.4.0/24InterfaceG0/1.99G0/1.99G0/1.99R3 Routing Table (OSPF Routes Only)\\nNext-hop10.1.99.210.1.99.110.1.99.4\\nMetroE E-LAN ServiceR1 R2\\nR4 R3\\nFigure 14-10 Layer 3 Forwarding Between Sites with E-LAN Service\\nLook at R3’s routing table in the figure, the route from R3 to R2’s LAN subnet (10.1.2.0/24). \\nIn this case, R3’s next-hop address is the WAN address on R2 (10.1.99.2), and R3 will send \\nptg17396363372  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\npackets (encapsulated in Ethernet frames) directly to R2. Note also that the other two \\nroutes in the routing table list the next-hop addresses of R1 (10.1.99.1) and           R4 (10.1.99.4).\\nLayer 3 Design with E-Tree Service\\nWith an E-Tree service, the Layer 3 design again           matches the EVC. That is, all the devices using the same single EVC have an address in the same subnet. However, an E-Tree can present some challenges for routing protocols, because of the three services discussed in this chapter, it is the only one in which some of the sites in the same EVC cannot send frames directly to each other. \\nFor example, Figure 14-11 shows one E-Tree service with R1 as the root. Routers R2 and \\nR3, as leaves, cannot send frames directly to each other, and therefore do not form routing protocol neighbor relationships. However, all three connect to the same E-Tree service. As a result:\\n■All three routers have an IP address in the same subnet (10.1.123.0/24).\\n■R1 will form a routing protocol neighbor relationship with both R2 and R3, but R2 will\\nnot form a routing protocol neighbor relationship with R3.\\n■As a result, packets between the leaf sites will flow through the root site.\\n.1R310.1.1.0/2410.1.2.0/24\\nSubnet 10.1.123.0 /24\\n.3.2\\nG0/1.13\\n10.1.3.0/24R2\\nR1\\nSubnet\\n10.1.1.0/2410.1.2.0/24InterfaceG0/1.13G0/1.13R3 Routing Table (OSPF Routes Only)\\nNext-hop10.1.123.110.1.123.1\\nFigure 14-11 Layer 3 Forwarding Between Leaves with E-Tree Service\\nThe routing (forwarding) process follows the path of the EVC, as shown in R3’s rout-\\ning table in the figure. The two routes are for remote subnets 10.1.1.0/24 (off R1) and 10.1.2.0/24 (off R2). Both of R3’s routes list R1 as the next-hop router (10.1.123.1), because that is the only possible next-hop router available to the leaf site with Router R3 on the WAN. When R3 needs to send packets to subnet 10.1.2.0/24, R3 will route them to R1, which will then route them to R2.\\nThis example may seem a lot like the example with E-Lines shown with Figure 14-9, but \\nthere are a couple of key differences. First, an E-Tree uses one subnet for all devices on the E-Tree service, while the example showing multiple E-Lines in Figure 14-9 shows one sub-net for each (point-to-point) E-Line. Additionally, some routing protocols require           additional configuration effort to work when using an E-Tree service, but those details are beyond the scope of this book.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  373\\nEthernet Virtual Circuit Bandwidth Profiles\\nBefore leaving MetroE to move on to MPLS, it helps to consider some ideas about data \\nusage over the WAN links and a whole topic area related to EVC Bandwidth Profiles (BWP).\\nFirst, ignoring MetroE for a moment, anyone who has shopped for mobile phone data \\nplans in the 2010s has already thought about data usage with carrier networks. With mobile phones, many carriers offer some kind of tiered pricing: the more data you want to send and receive, the more money you spend per month. Why do they charge more based on usage? The SP spends a lot of capital and a lot of ongoing operational expense to build and operate its network. It seems fair to charge those who use less of the network a little less money, and those who use more a little more money. Simple enough. \\nMost private WAN services use the same kind of usage-based pricing, and this last MetroE \\ntopic discusses some of the terminology and concepts.  \\nThe first big idea is this: The access links transmit bits at a set predefined speed based on \\nEthernet standards. Each Ethernet access link     on a MetroE WAN uses a specific Ethernet standard that runs at a specific speed. Those speeds are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps (that is, 1 Gbps), 10 Gbps, and so on. And while the IEEE has begun adding some new speeds for Ethernet standards, speeds that are not a multiple of 10 versus the next slower speed, the point is this: If a site’s MetroE access link is using an Ethernet standard that is a 100-Mbps standard, then the bits are transmitted at 100 Mbps.\\nAt the same time, the MetroE SP wants to be able to charge customers based on usage, \\nand to be a little more flexible than pricing based on the speed of the access links. These final few pages of the MetroE topics in this chapter show how a MetroE SP can charge for speeds other than the access link speeds.\\nCharging for the Data (Bandwidth) Used\\nThink through this scenario. A potential customer looks at a MetroE provider’s pricing. This customer wants an E-Line service between      two sites only. They know that they need at least 100 Mbps of capacity (that is, bandwidth) between the sites. But because the service has the word “Ethernet” in it, the potential customer thinks the service is either 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and so on. So they look up pricing for an E-Line service at those prices, and think:\\n■100 Mbps: Reasonably good price, but we need more capacity\\n■1000 Mbps: More than we want to spend, it’s enough capacity, but probably too much\\nAs it turns out, what this customer really wants is 200 Mbps between the two sites. However, there is no Ethernet standard that runs at 200 Mbps, so there is no way to use access links that run at 200 Mbps. But there is a solution: an E-Line service, with a Bandwidth Profile that defines a 200-Mbps committed information rate   (CIR) over the point-to-point EVC between the customer’s two routers. Figure 14-12 shows the ideas and terms.\\nptg17396363374  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n200 Mbps CIR EVC\\nG0/1\\n1 Gbps Access LinkG0/2 SW SW R1 R2\\n1 Gbps Access Link\\nFigure 14-12 Example: 200-Mbps CIR Supported by 1-Gbps Access Links\\nThe big ideas are simple, although the methods to control the data are new. The SP, per the \\ncontract with the customer, agrees to not only forward Ethernet frames between the two E-Line sites, but commits to a CIR of 200 Mbps. That is, the carrier commits to pass 200 Mbps worth of Ethernet frames over time.\\nWhen a customer asks for a new E-Line with a 200-Mbps CIR, they could send lots more \\ndata than 200 Mbps. Remember, the literal transmission rate would be 1 Gbps in this exam-ple, because the access links are 1-Gbps links. But over time, if all the customers that asked for a 200-Mbps CIR E-Line sent lots more than 200 Mbps worth of data, the SP’s network could become too congested. The SP builds its network to support the traffic it has com-mitted to send, plus some extra for expected overuse, and some extra for growth. But it is too expensive to build a network that allows customers that ask for and pay for 200 Mbps      to send at 1 Gbps all the time. \\nControlling Overages with Policing and Shaping\\nTo make the idea of fast access links with a slower      CIR on the EVCs work, and work well, both the SP and the customer have to cooperate. The tools are two Quality of Service (QoS) tools called policing and shaping.\\nHistorically, in some similar WAN services (like Frame Relay), the SP would actually let \\nyou send more data than your CIR, but MetroE networks typically use policing to discard the excess. A policer can watch incoming frames and identify the frames associated with each EVC. It counts the bytes in each frame, and determines a bit rate over time. When the customer has sent more bits than the CIR, the SP discards enough of the currently arriving frames to keep the rate down to the CIR. Figure 14-13 shows the location of policing in the same example shown in Figure 14-12.\\n200 Mbps CIR\\nG0/1 G0/2 SW SW R1 R2Police to 200 Mbps;\\nDiscard Frames!Police to 200 Mbps;\\nDiscard Frames!\\nFigure 14-13 SP Polices Incoming Traffic to Discard Excess Beyond CIR\\nRecapping this scenario, the customer decides to ask the MetroE SP for an E-Line. The customer’s routers use a 1-Gbps access link that allows the E-Line to support a 200-Mbps CIR. To protect the SP’s network, the SP now uses ingress  policing to monitor the bits/sec-ond received over each end of the E-Line’s point-to-point EVC. And the SP discards some incoming frames when the rate gets too high.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  375\\nHaving the SP discard a few frames is actually not that harmful if QoS is implemented cor-\\nrectly, but with MetroE, if the SP is policing as shown in Figure 14-13, the customer needs to use the other QoS tool: shaping. Shaping, as implemented on the customer routers, lets the routers slow down. Shaping tells the routers, on the MetroE access link, to send some frames, and then wait; then send more, then wait; and to do that repeatedly. Shaping  can be configured for that same rate as the CIR (200 Mbps in this case), so that the SP does not have to discard any traffic.\\nSummarizing some of these key points:\\n■MetroE uses the concept of an Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC), tying a committed\\nnumber of bits/second called the committed information rate (CIR) to the EVC.\\n■The access links need to be fast enough to handle the combined CIRs for all EVCs that\\ncross the link.\\n■For each EVC, the SP commits to forward the bits/second defined as the CIR for that\\nEVC.\\n■To protect its network from being overrun with too much traffic, the SP can use polic-\\ning, monitoring the incoming traffic rate on each EVC and discarding traffic that goes\\nbeyond the CIR.\\n■To prevent too much of its traffic from being discarded by the SP, the customer slows\\ndown its rate of sending over the EVC to match that same CIR, using      shaping on the cus-tomer router.\\nMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)\\nFrom your CCENT and CCNA R&S exam preparation, you have already learned a lot about \\nhow to build the basic components of an enterprise network. For each site, you buy some routers and switches. You connect the wired LAN devices to the switches, which in turn connect to a couple of routers. The routers connect to some WAN links    that connect to other sites, where you installed more routers and switches. \\nYou already understand a lot about the Layer 3 routing as well, as represented by the pack-\\net flowing left to right in Figure 14-14. Each router makes a separate forwarding decision to forward the packet, as shown as Steps 1, 2, and 3 in the figure. Each router makes a com-parison between the packet’s destination IP address and that router’s IP routing table; the matching IP routing table entry tells the router where to forward the packet next. To learn those routes, the routers typically run some routing protocol.\\nAn MPLS WAN service appears very much like that same model of how an IP network \\nworks with routers. This section discusses MPLS Layer 3 virtual private network (VPN) ser-vices, which create a Layer 3 WAN service. As a Layer 3 service, MPLS VPNs promise to forward IP packets across the WAN between the customer’s routers. \\nptg17396363376  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nR1 R2\\nR4 R310.1.1.0/24 10.1.2.0/24\\n10.1.3.0/24 10.1.4.0/241\\nIP2\\nIP3\\nIP\\nFigure 14-14 Basic IP Routing of IP Packets\\nAn SP could just build an IP network and connect customers to it. However, MPLS allows \\nthe SP to connect to many customers and keep their IP traffic separated in some important ways. For instance, packets sent by one customer will not be forwarded to a second cus-tomer, and vice versa. So, rather than just build a generic IP network with routers, SPs use MPLS, which gives them many advantages when creating a Layer 3 service for their cust-omers.\\nAs with all the WAN services, how the SP creates the service is hidden from the customer \\nfor the most part. However, just to give you a little insight as to why MPLS is not just an IP network with routers, internally, the devices in an MPLS network use label switching, hence the name MPLS. The routers on the edge of the MPLS network add and remove an MPLS header as packets enter and exit the MPLS network. The devices inside the MPLS network    then use the label field inside that MPLS header when forwarding data across the MPLS network. \\nNOTE While MPLS VPNs provide a Layer 3 service to customers, MPLS itself is some-times called a Layer 2.5 protocol, because it adds the MPLS header between the data link header (Layer 2) and the IP header (Layer 3).\\nAs usual, the discussion of WAN services in this book ignores as much of the SP’s network as possible. For instance, you do not need to know how MPLS labels work. However, because MPLS VPNs create a Layer 3 service, the customer must be more aware of what the SP does, so you need to know a few facts about how an MPLS network approaches some Layer 3 functions. In particular, the SP’s MPLS network: \\n■Needs to know about the customer’s IP subnets\\n■Will run IP routing protocols to learn those routes\\n■Will use routes about the customer’s IP address space to make forwarding decisions\\nMPLS Virtual Private Networks (MPLS VPNs) is one      common offering from SPs, available since the early 2000s, and is one of the most commonly used private WAN services today. Note that MPLS standards can be used to create other services besides Layer 3 MPLS VPNs. However, for the purposes of this chapter, all references to MPLS are specifically about MPLS VPNs. \\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  377\\nAs an aside, note that an MPLS VPN service does not encrypt data to make the network pri-\\nvate, as is done in some VPN services. Instead, MPLS VPNs make the data private by ensur-ing that data sent by one customer is not sent to a second customer, and vice versa, even though the packets for those two customers may pass through the same devices and links inside the MPLS network.\\nThis second of two major sections of the chapter works through the basics of MPLS, specif-\\nically MPLS VPNs. This section first looks at the design, topology, and terminology related to building the customer-facing parts of an MPLS network. It then    looks at the impact and issues created by the fact that the MPLS network provides a Layer 3 service.\\nMPLS VPN Physical Design and Topology\\nMetroE provides a Layer 2 service by forwarding Layer 2 Ethernet frames. To do that, the SP often uses Ethernet switches at the edge of its network. Those switches are configured to do more than what you learn about Ethernet LAN switches for CCNA, but a LAN switch’s most fundamental job is to forward an Ethernet frame, so it makes sense for MetroE to use an Ethernet switch at the edge of the SP’s MetroE network.\\nMPLS provides a Layer 3 service in that it promises to forward Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and \\nIPv6). To support that service, MPLS SPs typically      use routers at the edge of the MPLS net-works, because routers provide the function of forwarding Layer 3 packets. \\nAs usual, each WAN technology has its own set of terms and acronyms, so Figure 14-15 \\nshows two important MPLS terms in context: customer edge     (CE) and provider edge (PE). Because MPLS requires so much discussion about the devices on the edge of the customer and SP network, MPLS uses specific terms for each. The \\ncustomer edge  (CE) device is typi-\\ncally a router, and it sits at a customer site—that is, at a site in the company that is buying the MPLS service. The \\nprovider edge  (PE) devices sit at the edge of the SP’s network, on \\nthe other end of the access link. \\n10.1.1.0/24\\nMPLS:\\nHidden\\nDetailsCustomer\\nEdgeCustomer\\nEdge\\nProvider Edge10.1.2.0/24\\n10.1.3.0/24 10.1.4.0/24R1 R2\\nR4 R3\\nFigure 14-15 MPLS Layer 3 Design, with PE and CE Routers\\nNext, to appreciate what MPLS does, think back to how routers use their different kinds of \\nphysical interfaces and different kinds of data link protocols. When routing a packet, rout-ers discard an incoming data link frame’s data link header and trailer, and then build a new data link header/trailer. That action allows the incoming packet to arrive inside a frame of one data link protocol, and leave out an interface with another data link protocol.\\nptg17396363378  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWith MPLS, the fact that the devices      are routers, discarding and adding new data link head-\\ners, means that MPLS networks support a variety of access links. The fact that MPLS acts as a Layer 3 service, discarding incoming data link headers, means that any data link protocol could in theory be used on MPLS access links. In reality, MPLS does support many types of access links, as shown in Figure 14-16. \\n10.1.1.0/24\\nMPLS:\\nHidden\\nDetailsSerial\\n(TDM)\\nAccess Links10.1.2.0/24\\n10.1.3.0/24 10.1.4.0/24CE2\\nCE4 PE2 CE3PE3\\nPE4Frame\\nRelay\\nATMMetro\\nEthernetCE1 PE1Access Links\\nFigure 14-16 Popular MPLS Access Link Technologies\\nThe variety of access links available for MPLS networks makes MPLS a great option for \\nbuilding large enterprise networks. For sites that      are near MetroE services, especially for sites that need at least 10 Mbps of bandwidth, using MetroE as an access link makes great sense. Then, for sites that are more remote, the carrier may not offer MetroE services to that area, but many carriers can install a serial link to remote sites. Or, the enterprise may replace an existing Frame Relay or ATM network with MPLS, and in that case, the same physical links can be used, and the carrier can move those over to the MPLS network as MPLS access links. \\nMPLS and Quality of Service\\nMPLS was also the first WAN service for which the SP provided effective quality of service (QoS) features. And even though you have not yet gotten to Chapter 18, “Quality of Service (QoS),” you should be able       to get a general idea of an MPLS QoS benefit with the following basic example.\\nIP networks can and often do forward voice traffic in IP packets, called     Voice over IP \\n(VoIP). If a WAN service does not provide QoS, that means that the WAN service does not treat one packet any differently than any other packet. With QoS, the SP’s network can treat packets differently, giving some packets (like VoIP) better treatment. For a voice call to sound good, each voice packet must have low loss (that is, few packets are discarded); low one-way delay through the network; and low variation in delay (called jitter). Without QoS, a voice call over an IP network will not sound good.\\nWith a QoS-capable WAN, the customer can mark VoIP packets so that the MPLS network \\ncan recognize VoIP packets and treat them better, resulting in better voice call quality. But to make it work correctly, the customer and MPLS provider need to cooperate. \\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  379\\nFor instance, for VoIP packets travelling left to right in Figure 14-17, Router CE1 could be \\nconfigured with QoS marking tools. Marking tools could recognize VoIP packets, and place a specific value in the IP header of VoIP packets (a value called DSCP EF, per the figure). The MPLS WAN provider would then configure its QoS tools to react for packets that have that marking, typically sending that packet as soon as possible. The result: low delay, low jit-ter, low loss, and a better call quality.\\nCE1 CE2 PE1 PE2Before Sending, Mark\\nVolP as DSCP EFForward DSCP EF Now for Low: Delay, Jitter, Loss\\nMPLS1 2 3\\nFigure 14-17 MPLS VPN QoS Marking and Reaction in the MPLS WAN\\nNote that Chapter 18 is devoted to these same mechanisms, and others like it.\\nSummarizing the ideas so far, MPLS supports a variety of access links. An enterprise would \\nselect the type and speed of access link for each site based on the capacity (bandwidth) required for each site. Beyond that basic connectivity, the enterprise will want to work with the SP to define other features of the service. The customer and SP will need to work through the details of some Layer 3 design choices (as discussed in more depth in the next section). The customer will also likely want to ask for QoS services from the MPLS pro-vider, and     define those details.\\nLayer 3 with MPLS VPN\\nBecause MetroE provides a Layer 2 service, the SP has no need to understand anything about the customer’s Layer 3 design. The SP knows nothing about the customer’s IP addressing plan, and has no need to participate with routing protocols.\\nMPLS VPNs       take the complete opposite approach. As a Layer 3 service, MPLS must be \\naware of the customer IP addressing. The SP will even use routing protocols and advertise those customer routes across the WAN. This section takes a closer look at what that means.\\nFirst, keep the primary goals in mind. The customer pays good money for a WAN service \\nto deliver data between sites, with certain levels of availability and quality (for instance, low delay, jitter, and loss for VoIP). But to support that base function of allowing packet deliv-ery from each WAN site to the other, the CE routers need to exchange routes with the PE routers in the MPLS network. Additionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routers—a process that relies on the PE routers.\\nTo move into the specifics, first, the CE routers and the PE router on the ends of the same \\naccess link need to exchange routes, as shown in Figure 14-18. The figure shows the CE-PE routing protocol neighbor relationships (as lines with circles on the ends). In this case, the customer chose to use EIGRP. However, MPLS allows for many familiar routing protocols on the edge of the MPLS network: RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, and even eBGP. \\nptg17396363380  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n10.1.1.0/24\\n10.1.4.0/2410.1.3.0/2410.1.2.0/24\\nEIGRPEIGRPEIGRP\\nEIGRP\\nCE1 PE1CE2 PE2\\nCE3\\nCE4PE3\\nFigure 14-18 Routing Protocol Neighbor Relationships with MPLS Customer Edge \\nRouters\\nAdditionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routers. However, a \\nCE router does not form routing protocol neighbor relationships directly with the other CE routers, as noted in Figure 14-18. Summarizing what does and does       not happen: \\n■A CE router does become neighbors with the PE router on the other end of the access\\nlink.\\n■A CE router does not become neighbors with other CE routers.\\n■The MPLS network will advertise the customer’s routes between the various PE routers,\\nso that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing proto-\\ncol neighbor relationship.\\nTo advertise the customer routes between the PE routers, the PE routers use another \\nrouting protocol along with a process called   route redistribution . Route redistribution \\nhappens inside one router, taking routes from one routing protocol process and injecting them into another. MPLS does route redistribution in the PE routers between the routing protocol used by the customer and a variation of BGP called    Multiprotocol BGP (MPBGP). (Redistribution is needed when the PE-CE routing protocol is not BGP.) Figure 14-19 shows the idea.\\nCE1 CE3 PE1 PE3EIGRP MPBGPRedistribution\\nEIGRPRedistribution\\nFigure 14-19 MPLS VPN Using Redistribution with MPBGP at PE Router\\nJust as a quick aside about MPBGP, MPLS VPNs use MPBGP (as opposed to other routing protocols) because MPBGP can advertise routes from multiple customers while keeping the routes logically separated. For instance, continuing the example in Figure 14-19, Router PE1 might sit in one PoP but connect to dozens of different customers. Likewise, Router PE3 might connect to many of those same customers. MPBGP can advertise routes for all those customers and mark which routes are from which customers, so that only the correct routes are advertised       to each CE router for different customers.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  381\\nOSPF Area Design with MPLS VPN\\nNow that you know the basics about        what happens with routing protocols at the edge of \\nan MPLS network, take a step back and ponder OSPF area design. For all the other WAN services discussed in the book, the WAN service is just one more data link, so the WAN sits inside one area. With MPLS, the MPLS service acts like a bunch of routers. If you use OSPF as the PE-CE routing protocol, some choices must be made about OSPF areas, and about which WAN links are in which area, and where the backbone       area can and should be.\\nMPLS allows for a couple of variations on OSPF area design, but they all use an idea that \\nwas added to OSPF for MPLS VPNs, an idea that has come to be known informally as the    OSPF \\nsuper backbone . The idea is an elegant solution that meets OSPF needs and the \\nrequirement that the MPLS PEs, when using OSPF, must be in some OSPF area:\\n■The MPLS PEs form a backbone area by the name of a super backbone.\\n■Each PE-CE link can be any area—a non-backbone area or the backbone area.\\nAlthough the super backbone supports some functions and logic beyond the scope of this book, for the purposes of getting a basic understanding of OSPF’s use with MPLS, you can think of the super backbone as simply the majority of an enterprise’s OSPF backbone area, but with the option to make the backbone area larger. The CE routers at a customer site may not be part of the backbone area, or may be, at the choice of the customer network engineers.\\nFor example, for a nice clean design, each of the four customer sites in Figure 14-20 uses \\na different area. The PE-CE links are part of those individual areas. The OSPF backbone area still exists, and each area connects to the backbone area, but the backbone              exists in the MPLS PE routers only.\\nArea 1Area 0\\n(Superback bone) Area 2\\nArea 3 Area 4CE2\\nCE4 PE CE3PE\\nPECE1 PE\\nFigure 14-20 MPLS Design with (Super Backbone) Area 0, Non-Backbone Area for Each \\nSite\\nThe area design in Figure 14-20 provides a clean OSPF area design. However, if migrating \\nfrom some other type of WAN service, with an existing OSPF design, the network engi-neers may prefer to keep parts of an existing OSPF design, which means some sites may still need to include the backbone area. In fact, multiple WAN sites can be configured to be in the backbone area, and still function correctly. Figure 14-21 shows one such example.\\nptg17396363382  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nArea 1Area 0Area 0\\n(Super Backbone) Area 2\\nArea 3 Area 0CE2\\nCE4 PE CE3PE\\nPEPECE1R1\\nR2\\nR3\\nFigure 14-21 Using Area 0 on CE-PE Link, or for Entire Site\\nIn effect, the super backbone combines with the two other parts of the network configured \\nas area 0 for one contiguous backbone area. Notice on the left side of Figure 14-21 the two sites with area 0 noted. Normally, if both customer sites implement area 0, but there were links from some other area between them, the design would break OSPF design rules. However, the OSPF backbone (area 0) links on the left, plus the OSPF super backbone area 0 created by MPLS, act together in regard to OSPF design.  \\nNext, focus on the site at the upper left. That site represents what might have existed \\nbefore migrating to an MPLS design, with Router R1’s links in area 0, and the links con-nected to Routers R2 and R3 in area 1. The enterprise network engineer may have decided to leave the OSPF area design alone when connecting to the MPLS network. To support those backbone area links off Router R1, the engineer put the CE1-PE1 link into area 0. As a result, the combined              customer area 0 instances and the super backbone area 0 creates one contiguous backbone area.\\nRouting Protocol Challenges with EIGRP\\nUsing EIGRP as the PE-CE routing protocol poses            fewer challenges than when using OSPF. However, there is one configuration setting that impacts the routing protocol metrics with EIGRP, so it is worth a brief mention.\\nWith an MPLS service, because of the effects of route redistribution to exchange routes, \\nthe PE-CE configuration at each site could use a different EIGRP AS number (ASN) in the configurations. For example, in Figure 14-22, thinking about route exchange from CE1 all the way to CE2, the process uses EIGRP from CE1 to PE1, and from PE2 to CE2. But what happens between PE1 and PE2 is an independent process that does not use EIGRP, but rather MPBGP, so the requirement to use the same ASN on both ends is removed.\\nAlthough a customer could use different EIGRP ASNs, EIGRP metrics are more realistic if \\nyou use the same EIGRP ASN at all sites. In fact, if the enterprise did use the same EIGRP ASN, the entire MPLS network’s impact on EIGRP metrics would act as if everything between the PEs (in the middle of the MPLS network) did not exist. For instance, with the same ASN used at all sites in Figure 14-22, the EIGRP topology, from a metrics perspective, looks more like the            design in Figure 14-23.\\nptg1739636314Chapter 14: Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS  383\\nCE2\\nCE4 PE4 CE3PE2\\nPE3CE1 PE1EIGRP\\nASN 1\\nEIGRP\\nASN 3EIGRP\\nASN 2\\nEIGRP\\nASN 4\\nFigure 14-22 Routing Protocol Neighbor Relationships with EIGRP\\nCE4 CE3PECE2 CE1EIGRP ASN 1\\nEIGRP ASN 1 EIGRP ASN 1EIGRP ASN 1\\nFigure 14-23 EIGRP Metrics Unaffected by MPLS VPN Internals\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

The stars of this chapter are generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnels and PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE). To support those topics, the chapter touches on a variety of related topics, including some Internet access technologies, security basics, and some important VPN protocols such as IP Security (IPsec) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). \\nThis chapter breaks the material into three major sections. The first discusses Internet access \\noptions and the basics of VPN protocols used over the Internet. The second and third major sections are traditional concept, configure, verify, and troubleshoot sections, with the sec-ond section about GRE, and the third about PPPoE. \\nFrom a study planning perspective, this chapter is one of the longest chapters in the book. \\nAll the topics are related, so I decided to keep them in one larger chapter. However, you can easily treat each major section as a separate chapter from the sense of managing your time.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

The   Internet core connects ISPs to each other using a variety of high-speed technologies. Additionally, Internet access links connect an ISP to each customer, again with a wide variety of technologies. The combination on ISP networks and customer networks that connect to the ISPs together create the worldwide Internet.\\nFor these customer access links, the technologies need to be inexpensive so that a typi-\\ncal consumer can afford to pay for the service. But businesses can use many of these same technologies to connect to the Internet. Some    WAN technologies happen to work particu-larly well as Internet access technologies. For example, several use the same telephone line installed into most homes by the phone company so that the ISPs do not have to install additional cabling. Others use the cable TV cabling, whereas others use wireless.\\nWhile consumers connect to the Internet to reach destinations on the Internet, businesses \\ncan also use the    Internet as a WAN service. An enterprise can connect each business site to the Internet. Then, using virtual private network (VPN) technology, the enterprise can create an Internet VPN. An Internet VPN   can keep the enterprise’s packet private through encryp-tion and other means, even while sending the data over the Internet.\\nThis first of three major sections of the chapter reviews some of the basics of Internet \\naccess links. These details are needed as background for some of the exam topics discussed later in the chapter. This section then introduces the basics of how an enterprise can com-municate securely over the internet, making the public Internet act like a private network, by creating an Internet VPN. \\nInternet Access \\nPrivate WAN technology   may be used to access an ISP’s network, including all the private WAN technologies discussed in Chapter 14, “Private WANs with Ethernet and MPLS.” Businesses often use time-division multiplexing (TDM) serial links, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), or Metro Ethernet to access the Internet. Figure 15-1 shows a few of these, just as a visual reminder of these options.\\nThe next few pages review some of the Internet access technologies not yet discussed \\nelsewhere in the book. These topics exist to give you a little more context about the more detailed topics of building Internet VPNs.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A 2 A 3 C 4 B 5 C 6 B, D 7 A\\nptg17396363390  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nMPLS VPN\\nMetro EthernetInternet\\n- Delivers IP Packets- Public!TDM (T3, E3)ISP\\nRoutersCustomer\\nSites\\nFigure 15-1 Three Examples of Internet Access Links for Companies\\nDigital Subscriber Line\\nIn the consumer Internet access space, one     big speed breakthrough happened with the intro-\\nduction of the digital subscriber line (DSL). It represented a big technological breakthrough in terms of raw speed in comparison to some older technologies, such as analog modems. These faster speeds available through DSL also changed how people could use the Internet, because many of today’s common applications would be unusable with the earlier Internet access technologies (analog modems and Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN). \\nNOTE If you are interested in a few pages of information about the older Internet access technologies of analog modems and ISDN, look to this book’s DVD Appendix K, “Topics from Previous Editions,” for a section titled “Dial Access with Modems and ISDN.”\\nTelephone companies (telcos) greatly   influenced the creation of DSL. As a technology, DSL gave telcos a way to offer much faster Internet access speeds. As a business opportunity, DSL gave telcos a way to offer a valuable high-speed Internet service to many of their exist-ing telephone customers, over the same physical phone line already installed, which created a great way for telcos to make money.\\nFigure 15-2 shows some of the details of how DSL works on a home phone line. The phone \\ncan do what it has always done: plug into a phone jack and send analog signals. For the data, a DSL modem connects to a spare phone outlet. The DSL modem sends and receives the data, as digital signals, at higher frequencies, over the same local loop, even at the same time as a telephone call. (Note that the physical installation often uses frequency filters that are not shown in the figure or discussed here.)\\nBecause DSL sends analog (voice) and digital (data) signals on the same line, the telco has \\nto somehow split those signals on the telco side of the connection. To do so, the local loop must be connected   to a DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM) located in the nearby telco cen-tral office (CO). The DSLAM splits out the digital data over to the router on the lower right in Figure 15-2, which completes the connection to the Internet. The DSLAM also splits out the analog voice signals over to the voice switch on the upper right.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  391\\nVoice\\nSwitchPSTN\\nPhone\\nCable\\nDSL \\nModem\\nHome Telco CODSLAMEthernet Cable\\nInternetTelephone\\nLine\\nFigure 15-2 Wiring and Devices for a Home DSL Link\\nDSL has some advantages and disadvantages, of course. For instance, one variation of \\nDSL, called asymmetric   DSL (ADSL), offers a faster speed toward the customer (download speed), which better matches the traffic patterns of most consumer traffic. Many consumer ADSL offerings routinely support speeds in the 5-Mbps range, and up to 24 Mbps in ideal conditions. (DSL includes other options that have symmetric speeds as well.) However, DSL works only at certain distances from the CO to the customer site, and the speeds degrade at those longer cabling distances. So, the quality of the DSL service, or availability of the service at all, may    be impacted simply by the distance between the home/business site and the CO.\\nCable Internet\\nDSL uses the local link (telephone line) from the    local telco. Cable Internet instead uses the cabling from what has become the primary competitor to the telco in most markets: the cable company.\\nCable Internet creates an Internet access service which, when viewed generally rather than \\nspecifically, has many similarities to DSL. Like DSL, cable Internet takes full advantage of existing cabling, using the existing cable TV (CATV) cable to send data. Like DSL, cable Internet uses asymmetric speeds, sending data faster downstream than upstream, which works well for most consumer locations. And cable Internet still allows the normal service on the cable (cable TV), at the same time as the Internet access service is working.\\nCable Internet also uses the same general idea for in-home cabling as DSL, just using CATV \\ncabling instead of telephone cabling. The left side of Figure 15-3 shows a TV connected to the CATV cabling, just as it would normally connect. At another cable outlet, a cable modem connects to the same cable. The Internet service flows over one frequency, like yet another TV channel, just reserved for Internet service.\\nSimilar to DSL, on the CATV company side of the connection (on the right side of the fig-\\nure), the CATV company must split out the data and video traffic. Data flows to the lower right, through a router, to the Internet. The video comes    in from video dishes for distribu-tion out to the TVs in people’s homes.\\nptg17396363392  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nCATV\\nCable\\nCable \\nModem\\nHomeCable\\nCo\\nEthernet Cable\\nInternet\\nFigure 15-3 Wiring and Devices for a Home Cable Internet Link\\nWireless WAN (3G, 4G, LTE)\\nMany of you reading this book have     a mobile phone that has Internet access. That is, you \\ncan check your email, surf the Web, download apps, and watch videos. Many of us today rely on our mobile phones, and the Internet access built in to those phones, for most of our tweets and the like. This section touches on the big concepts behind the Internet access technology connecting those mobile phones.\\nMobile phones use radio waves to communicate through a nearby mobile phone tower. The \\nphone has a small radio antenna, and the provider has a much larger antenna sitting at the top of a tower somewhere within miles of you and your phone. Phones, tablet computers, laptops, and even routers (with the correct interface cards) can communicate through to the Internet using this technology, as represented in Figure 15-4.\\nMobile\\nProvider\\nas\\nISPInternet\\nFigure 15-4 Wireless Internet Access Using 3G/4G Technology\\nThe mobile phone radio towers also have cabling and equipment, including routers. The mobile provider builds its own IP network, much like an ISP builds out an IP network. The customer IP packets pass through the IP router at the tower into the mobile provider’s IP network and then out to the Internet.\\nThe market for mobile phones and wireless Internet access for other devices is both large and \\ncompetitive. As a result, the mobile providers spend a lot of money advertising their services, with lots of names for one service or the other. Frankly, it can be difficult to tell what all the marketing jargon means, but a few terms tend to be used throughout the industry:\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  393\\nWireless Internet: A general term for   Internet services from a mobile phone or from any \\ndevice that uses the same technology.\\n3G/4G Wireless: Short for third generation   and fourth generation, these terms refer to \\nthe major changes over time to the mobile phone companies’ wireless networks.\\nLTE: Long-Term Evolution, which is   a newer and faster technology considered to be part \\nof fourth generation (4G) technology.\\nThe takeaway from all this jargon is this: When you hear about wireless Internet services \\nwith a mobile phone tower in the picture—whether the device is a phone, tablet, or PC—it is probably a 3G, 4G, or LTE wireless Internet     connection.\\nFiber Internet Access\\nThe consumer-focused Internet    access technologies discussed in this section use a couple of different physical media. DSL uses the copper wiring installed between the telco CO and the home. Cable uses the copper CATV cabling installed from the cable company to the home. And of course wireless WAN technologies do not use cables.\\nThe cabling used by DSL and cable Internet uses copper wires, but, comparing different \\ntypes of physical media, fiber-optic cabling generally supports faster speeds for longer dis-tances. That is, just comparing physical layer technologies across the breadth of networking, fiber-optic cabling supports longer links, and those links often run at equivalent or faster speeds.\\nSome ISPs now offer Internet access that goes by the name of fiber Internet, or simply \\nfiber. To make that work, some local company that owns the rights to install cabling under-ground in a local area (often a telephone company) installs new fiber-optic cabling. Once the cable plant is in place (a process that often takes years as well as a large budget), the fiber ISP then connects customers to the Internet using the fiber-optic cabling. Often, the fiber uses Ethernet protocols over the fiber. The end result: high-speed Internet to the home, often    using Ethernet technology.\\nInternet VPN Fundamentals\\nPrivate WANs have some wonderful security features. In particular, the customers who send data through the WAN have good reason to believe that no attackers saw the data in transit, or even changed the data to cause some harm. The private WAN service provider promises to send one customer’s data to other sites owned by that customer, but not to sites owned by other customers, and vice versa.\\nVPNs try to provide the same secure features as a private WAN while sending data over a \\nnetwork that is open to other parties (such as the Internet). Compared to a private WAN, the Internet does not provide for a secure environment that protects the privacy of an enter-prise’s data. Internet VPNs can provide    important security features, like:\\n■Confidentiality (privacy): Preventing  anyone in the middle of the Internet (man in the\\nmiddle) from being able to read the data\\n■Authentication: Verifying that the sender of the   VPN packet is a legitimate device andnot a device used by an attacker\\n■Data integrity: Verifying that the packet was not  changed as the packet transited theInternet\\nptg17396363394  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n■Anti-replay: Preventing a man in the middle from  copying and later replaying the pack-\\nets sent by a legitimate user, for the purpose of appearing to be a legitimate user\\nTo accomplish these goals, two devices near the edge of the Internet create a VPN, some-\\ntimes called a VPN tunnel. These   devices add headers to the original packet, with these headers including fields that allow the VPN devices to make the traffic secure. The VPN devices also encrypt the original IP packet, meaning that the original packet’s contents are undecipherable to anyone who happens to see a copy of the packet as it traverses the Internet.\\nFigure 15-5 shows the general idea of what typically occurs with a VPN tunnel. The fig-\\nure shows a VPN created between a branch office router and a Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), which is one of Cisco’s product names for a firewall. In this case, the VPN is called     a site-to-site VPN because it connects two sites of a company. \\nEnterprise\\nCentral SiteASA-11 2 34 5\\nInternet64.100.9.9 128.107.1.1\\nPC1\\n10.2.2.2\\nBranch OfficeIP PacketSource = 10.2.2.2\\nDestination = 10.1.1.1Source = 10.2.2.2\\nDestination = 10.1.1.1\\nNew IP Hdr VPN Header EncryptedSource = 64.100.9.9\\nDestination = 128.107.1.1\\nIP PacketS1\\n10.1.1.1\\nFigure 15-5 VPN Tunnel Concepts for a Site-to-Site Intranet VPN\\nThe figure shows the following steps, which explain the overall flow:\\n1. Host PC1 (10.2.2.2) on the right sends a packet to the web server (10.1.1.1), just as it\\nwould without a VPN.\\n2. The router encrypts the packet, adds some VPN headers, adds another IP header(with public IP addresses), and forwards the packet.\\n3. An attacker in the Internet copies the packet (called a man-in-the-middle attack).However, the attacker cannot change the packet without being noticed and cannotread the contents of the original packet.\\n4. Device ASA-1 receives the packet, confirms the authenticity of the sender, confirmsthat the packet has not been changed, and then decrypts the original packet.\\n5. Server S1 receives the unencrypted packet.\\nThe benefits of using an Internet-based VPN as shown in Figure 15-5 are many. The cost of \\na high-speed Internet connection   as discussed in the early pages of this chapter is usually much less than that of many private WAN options. The Internet is seemingly everywhere, making this kind of solution available worldwide. And by using VPN technology and proto-cols, the communications are secure.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  395\\nNOTE The term tunnel refers to any protocol’s packet that is sent by encapsulating the \\npacket inside another packet. The term VPN tunnel may or may not imply that the tunnel also uses encryption. Many of the VPN tunnels discussed    in this chapter would normally include encryption when used in production. \\nSite-to-Site VPNs with IPsec\\nAs just discussed regarding the example shown in Figure 15-5, a site-to-site VPN means that two enterprise sites create a VPN tunnel by encrypting and sending data between two devices. One set of rules for creating a     site-to-site VPN is defined by IPsec.\\nIPsec is an architecture or framework for security services for IP networks. The name itself \\nis not an acronym, but rather a name derived from the title of the RFC that defines it (RFC 4301, Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol), more  generally called IP Security, or \\nIPsec.\\nIPsec defines how two devices, both of which connect to the Internet, can achieve the main \\ngoals of a VPN as listed at the beginning of this chapter: confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and anti-replay. IPsec does not define just one way to implement a VPN, instead allowing several different protocol options for each VPN feature. One of IPsec’s strengths is that its role as an architecture allows it to be added to and changed over time as improvements to individual security functions are made.\\nThis chapter does not go through the details of each part of IPsec, but to give you some \\ngeneral idea of some of IPsec’s work, this section shows how two IPsec endpoints encrypt data and add IPsec VPN headers to the encrypted data.\\nThe idea of IPsec encryption might sound intimidating, but if you ignore the math—and \\nthankfully, you can—IPsec encryption is not too difficult to understand. IPsec encryption uses a pair of encryption algorithms, which are essentially math formulas, to meet a couple of requirements. First, the two math formulas    are a matched set:\\n■One to hide (encrypt) the data\\n■Another to re-create (decrypt) the original data based on the encrypted data\\nBesides those somewhat obvious functions, the two math formulas were chosen so that if an attacker intercepted the encrypted text but did not have the secret password (called an   encryption key), decrypting that one packet would be difficult. In addition, the formulas are also chosen so that if an attacker did happen to decrypt one packet, that information would not give the attacker     any advantages in decrypting the other packets.\\nThe process for encrypting data for an IPsec VPN works generally as shown in Figure 15-6. \\nNote that the encryption key is also known    as the session key, shared key, or shared ses-\\nsion key.\\nptg17396363396  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nReceiving Host\\nSession KeySession KeySending Host\\n)·\\x03\\x0b(QFU\\\\SWHG\\x10GDWD\\x0f\\x036HVVLRQ\\x10NH\\\\\\x0c\\x03 \\x03\\x03&OHDU\\x10WH[W\\x03\\'DWDOriginal\\nIP PacketOriginal\\nIP Packet\\n(QFU\\\\SWHG\\x03\\'DWD ,3\\x03+HDGHU 931\\x03+HDGHU1\\n324)\\x0b,3\\x033DFNHW\\x0f\\x036HVVLRQ\\x10NH\\\\\\x0c\\x03 \\x03\\x03\\x03(QFU\\\\SWHG\\x03\\'DWD\\nFigure 15-6 Basic IPsec Encryption Process\\nThe four steps highlighted    in the figure are as follows:\\n1. The sending VPN device (like the remote office router in Figure 15-5) feeds the origi-\\nnal packet and the session key into the encryption formula, calculating the encrypteddata.\\n2. The sending device encapsulates the encrypted data into a packet, which includes thenew IP header and VPN header.\\n3. The sending device sends this new packet to the destination VPN device (ASA-1 backin Figure 15-5).\\n4. The receiving VPN device runs the corresponding decryption formula, using theencrypted data and session key—the same     key value as was used on the sending VPNdevice—to decrypt the data.\\nClient VPNs with SSL\\nThe Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol       serves as an alternative VPN technology to IPsec. \\nIn particular, today’s web browsers support SSL as a way to dynamically create a secure connection from the web browser to a web server, supporting safe online access to financial transactions. This brief topic explains a few details about how you can use SSL to create cli-ent VPNs.\\nWeb browsers use HTTP as the protocol with which to connect to web servers. However, \\nwhen the communications with the web server need to be secure, the browser switches to use SSL. SSL uses well-known port 443, encrypting data sent between the browser and the server and authenticating the user. Then, the HTTP messages flow over the SSL VPN con-nection.\\nThe built-in SSL functions of a web browser create one secure web browsing session, but \\nthis same SSL technology can be used to create a client VPN using a Cisco VPN client. The \\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (or AnyConnect Client for short) is software that sits on a user’s PC and uses SSL to create one end of a VPN remote-access tunnel. As a result, all the packets sent to the other end of the tunnel are encrypted, not just those sent over a single HTTP connection in a web browser. \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  397\\nFor example, the VPN tunnel shown for PC A in Figure 15-7 uses the AnyConnect Client to \\ncreate a client VPN. The AnyConnect Client creates an SSL tunnel to the ASA firewall that has been installed to expect VPN clients to connect to it. The tunnel encrypts all traffic, so that PC A can use any application available at the enterprise network on the right.\\nInternet\\nASA\\nWeb BrowserCisco AnyConnect \\nSecure Mobility Client\\nA\\nB\\nS2S1 SSL (to ASA Firewall)\\nSSL (for a Single Web Browse)\\nFigure 15-7 Client VPN Options (SSL)\\nNote that while the figure shows an ASA firewall used at the main enterprise site, many \\ntypes of devices can be used on the server side of an SSL connection as well. The web server itself can be the endpoint of an SSL connection from a web browser, but often, to improve server performance, the SSL tunnel on the server side terminates on specialized devices like the Cisco ASA or a router.\\nThe bottom of Figure 15-7 shows a client VPN     that supports a web application for a single \\nweb browser tab. The experience is much like when you connect to any other secure website today: the session uses SSL, so all traffic sent to and from that web browser tab is encrypted with SSL. Note that PC B does not use the AnyConnect Client; the user simply opens a web browser to browse to server S2. However, by using SSL, that one session is encrypted with SSL, providing better security.\\nGRE Tunnels and DMVPN\\nThe device on the endpoint of an Internet VPN takes a normal unencrypted packet and per-forms several functions before forwarding that packet. One of those functions is to encrypt the packet, and another is to encapsulate the packet in a new IP header. The new IP header uses addresses in the unsecured network (usually the Internet), allowing the routers between the two VPN tunnel endpoints to forward the VPN IP packet. The original IP packet, including the original IP header, is encrypted and unreadable.\\nThis second major section of this chapter examines a subset of the work to create that kind \\nof site-to-site VPN tunnel. In particular, this section looks at how to set up the tunnel, while ignoring the encryption function. Specifically, this section looks at the concepts and config-uration of how routers create a tunnel, encapsulating the original IP packet inside another IP packet. The goal is to give you some general ideas about how tunneling works, while leaving the detailed security configuration to other certifications like CCNA Security.\\nThis section concludes with a short discussion of Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN). \\nDMVPN helps solve some shortcomings with deploying point-to-point GRE tunnels on a larger scale. \\nptg17396363398  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGRE Tunnel Concepts\\nThis chapter looks at one     type of IP tunnel: generic routing encapsulation (GRE). GRE, \\ndefined in RFC 2784, defines an additional header used by GRE to perform tunneling, along with the new IP header, that encapsulates the original packet. Two routers work together, with matching configuration settings, to create a GRE IP tunnel. Then, IPsec con-figuration can be added to encrypt the traffic.\\nThe discussion of GRE tunnels looks at the concepts from several perspectives. The first sec-\\ntion shows how packets can be routed over a GRE tunnel, much like using a serial link inside a secured enterprise network. The rest of this topic then explains how GRE does its work.\\nRouting over GRE Tunnels\\nA GRE tunnel exists between two routers, with the tunnel working very much like a serial link with regard to packet forwarding. So, before discussing GRE tunnels, this section first reviews some familiar facts about     routers and serial links, using Figure 15-8 as an example.\\nHDLC\\nDestination = 10.1.2.2Packet\\nOriginal PacketS1\\n10.1.1.110.1.2.2S0/0/110.1.3.2\\nS0/0/010.1.3.1\\nR2 R1PC110.1.1.9 10.1.2.9\\nFigure 15-8 Routing an IP Packet over a Serial Link\\nThe small network in Figure 15-8 looks like a part of many enterprise networks. It uses \\nprivate IP addresses (network 10.0.0.0). It has an IP address on each router interface, includ-ing on each serial interface. The IP addresses on the serial interfaces (10.1.3.1 and 10.1.3.2, respectively) are in the same subnet. And when PC1 sends a packet to destination IP address 10.1.2.2, R1 will encapsulate the packet in the data link protocol used on the link, like the default   High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) encapsulation shown in the figure.\\nAlso, note that all the parts of this small enterprise network exist in secure spaces. This net-\\nwork has no need to encrypt data using a VPN.\\nGRE creates a concept that works just like the serial link in Figure 15-8, at least with regard \\nto IP routing. Instead of a serial link with serial interfaces, the routers use virtual interfaces called tunnel interfaces. The       two routers have IP addresses on their tunnel interfaces in the \\nsame subnet. Figure 15-9 shows an example where the serial link has been replaced with these virtual tunnel interfaces.\\nS1\\n10.1.2.210.1.2.9\\n10.1.1.1PC110.1.1.910.1.3.1 10.1.3.2\\nTunnel0 Tunnel1R2 R1\\nDestination = 10.1.2.2Original PacketTunnel(Private) (Private)\\nFigure 15-9 Replacing the Serial Link with an IP Tunnel\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  399\\nSticking with the big ideas about IP routing for now, the tunnel looks like just another link \\nin the secure part of the network. The tunnel IP addresses are from the secure enterprise network. The routers encapsulate the original packet inside a tunnel header, which takes the place of the serial link’s HDLC header. And the routers will even have routes that list the tunnel interfaces (Tunnel0 and Tunnel1 in this case) as the outgoing interfaces.\\nTo make use of the GRE tunnel, the routers    treat it like any other link with a point-to-point \\ntopology. The routers have IPv4 addresses in the same subnet. The routers use a routing protocol to become neighbors and exchange routes over the tunnel. And the routes learned over the tunnel list the tunnel interface as the outgoing interface, with the neighboring rout-er’s tunnel interface IP address as the next-hop router. Figure 15-10 shows an example, with the routes learned by each router listed at the bottom.\\nS1\\n10.1.2.2Routing Protocol\\nR2 R1\\nSubnet\\n10.1.2.0/24R1 Routing Table (OSPF Routes)10.1.1.0/24 10.1.2.0/24\\nInterface\\nTunnel0Next-hop10.1.3.2 Subnet10.1.1.0/24R2 Routing Table (OSPF Routes)\\nInterfaceTunnel1 Next-hop10.1.3.1Tunnel0 Tunnel110.1.3.1 10.1.3.2\\nTunnel\\n10.1.1.1PC1 10.1.1.9 10.1.2.9\\nFigure 15-10 Routes Learned with a Routing Protocol over the IP Tunnel \\nLook closely at the route for subnet 10.1.2.0/24. The subnet exists on the right side of the \\nfigure, connected to R2. R1 has learned a route for the 10.1.2.0/24 subnet, as learned from R2. (R1’s routing table is on the left side of the figure.) To create that route, first R2 will have a connected route to subnet 10.1.2.0/24. R1 and R2 will use some routing protocol (for instance, OSPF) to exchange routing information. R1 will add a new route for subnet 10.1.2.0/24.\\nMost importantly, note the use of the tunnel interface in the route as shown beneath Router \\nR1 in the figure. That route will list R1’s own tunnel interface, Tunnel0, as the outgoing interface. That route lists R2’s tunnel interface IP address, 10.1.3.2, as the next-hop router, as shown in R1’s IP routing table in the bottom-left part of the figure. \\nNOTE From a Layer 3 perspective, the tunnel interface shown in this example works like a point-to-point link. In fact, the tunnel shown in the examples so far is called    a point-to-\\npoint GRE tunnel. DMVPN also uses GRE, but it uses multipoint GRE tunnels, which have more than two endpoints in the same tunnel.\\nAll these concepts show how the GRE tunnel    acts like just one more link in the secure part of an internetwork. The next few pages look at how GRE tunnels forward these packets over an unsecure network between the two routers.\\nptg17396363400  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGRE Tunnels over the Unsecured Network\\nThe previous few figures     have a tunnel between two routers, one that looks like a pipe, but \\nthose diagrams do not tell us much about the physical network behind the tunnel. The tunnel can exist over any IP network. The tunnel is created using an IP network to forward the original packets, so any IP network between Routers R1 and R2 would allow the tunnel to exist.\\nOften, site-to-site VPNs, like the one shown in Figure 15-10, use an unsecured network like \\nthe Internet as the IP network. The whole idea ties back to economics. The monthly cost of high-speed Internet access at each site is often less than paying for other private WAN ser-vices. But no matter what type of Internet connection exists, the routers on the tunnel can use the Internet as a way to forward the packets between the two tunnel routers, as shown in Figure 15-11.\\n10.1.1.1PC110.1.1.9\\nThe Internet1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2\\nS0/0/0 S0/0/1R2 R1\\nDestination = 10.1.2.2Original PacketS1\\n10.1.2.210.1.2.9(Public) (Public)\\nFigure 15-11 Sending the Tunnel over the Internet\\nThe routers on the ends of the GRE tunnel create the tunnel by agreeing to send each other packets over the unsecure network between the two. Figure 15-11 shows many of the details that the engineer needs to know about the two routers before configuring the GRE tunnel on both ends. The figure shows the interfaces R1 and R2 each use to connect to the Internet. And it shows the IP addresses each router uses on its Internet connections, in this case 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 just to use more memorable numbers.\\nThe router configuration uses virtual interfaces called tunnel interfaces. These interfaces \\ndo not exist until the engineer creates the tunnel with the     interface tunnel command. For instance, the command interface tunnel 0 creates a tunnel interface numbered as 0. To cre-ate a tunnel, both routers create a tunnel interface and use IP addresses as if the tunnel     were a point-to-point link.\\nFigure 15-12 shows a conceptual diagram of a packet coming into Router R1 from PC1, one \\nthat needs to be forwarded over the GRE tunnel to Server S1 (10.1.2.2). When the router uses its IP routing logic from the secured part of the network, as shown in Figure 15-9, R1 wants to send the packet over the tunnel. Figure 15-12 shows the encapsulation done by R1.\\nNOTE If the two routers creating this tunnel also configured the IPsec encryption part of the tunnel, before encapsulating the original packet as shown in Figure 15-11, the sending router would first encrypt the original packet.\\nGRE specifies the use of two headers to create the tunnel. GRE defines its own header, used to manage the tunnel itself. GRE also defines the use of a complete 20-byte IP header, called   the delivery header. This header will use IP addresses from the unsecure network. In \\nthis case, the delivery IP header will list R1’s 1.1.1.1 Internet IP address as the source and R2’s 2.2.2.2 Internet IP address as the destination.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  401\\nS1\\n10.1.2.210.1.2.91.1.1.1 2.2.2.2\\nR2 R1\\nDelivery\\nHeaderSource = 1.1.1.1\\nGRE\\nHeaderPayload\\nPacket\\nOriginal PacketDest. = 2.2.2.210.1.1.1PC1 10.1.1.9\\nThe Internet\\nFigure 15-12 Encapsulating the Original IP Packet in a GRE-Formatted Packet\\nWhile this packet passes through the Internet, the routers in the Internet use this outer GRE \\ndelivery IP header to route the packet. The fact that this packet happens to hold another entire IP packet inside does not matter to the IP forwarding process in those routers; they just forward the IP packet based on the 2.2.2.2 destination IP address. Figure 15-13 shows the concept; note that this packet may be routed by many routers in the Internet before arriving at R2.\\n10.1.1.1PC1S1\\n10.1.2.21.1.1.1 2.2.2.2\\nR2 R1\\nDelivery\\nHeader\\nDestination = 10.1.2.2 (Ignored)GRE\\nHeaderPayload\\nPacket\\nDestination = 2.2.2.2 (Used)The Internet\\nFigure 15-13 Internet Routers Forwarding GRE IP Packet Based on Public IP Addresses\\nWhen the GRE packet in Figure 15-13 finally arrives on the right side of the Internet, at R2, R2 needs to extract the original IP packet. With physical links, R2 would normally simply remove the old incoming data link header. With a GRE-encapsulated packet, the receiving router (R2) also needs to remove the delivery header and the GRE header, leaving     the origi-nal packet, as shown in Figure 15-14.\\n10.1.1.1PC1 10.1.1.9S1\\n10.1.2.210.1.2.91.1.1.1 2.2.2.2\\nR2 R1\\nDelivery\\nHeaderGRE\\nHeaderPayload\\nPacketOriginal PacketS0/0/0 S0/0/1 The Internet\\nFigure 15-14 Destination Tunnel Endpoint Decapsulates the Original Packet and \\nForwards It\\nptg17396363402  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE If the routers also configured the IPsec encryption part of the tunnel, just after the \\nsteps shown in Figure 15-14, the receiving router would then decrypt the original packet.\\nConfiguring GRE Tunnels\\nConfiguring GRE tunnels requires    only a few commands. The challenge with GRE configu-ration comes in organizing the configuration parameters. The configuration requires a tunnel interface, with IP addresses from the secured part of the network configured with the ip \\naddress interface command. It also requires that the two routers declare both their own IP address (source) and the other router’s IP address (destination), used in the unsecure part of the network. Figure 15-15 shows the organization of the various configuration parameters.\\nTunnel\\nInterfaceAddressAddresses from Secured Network\\nAddresses from Unsecured Network (Usually Internet)Same SubnetTunnel\\nInterfaceAddress\\nOne Router The Other RouterTunnelSource\\nTunnel\\nDestinationTunnelSource\\nTunnel\\nDestination\\nFigure 15-15 GRE Tunnel Configuration: Relationship of Parameters\\nThe following list details the configuration steps on each router:\\nStep 1. Use the interface tunnel number global command to create a tunnel interface. \\nThe interface numbers have local meaning only and do not have to match \\nbetween the two routers.\\nStep 2. (Optional) Use the tunnel mode gre ip interface subcommand in tunnel inter-\\nface mode to tell IOS to use GRE encapsulation on the tunnel. (This is the default setting for a tunnel interface.) \\nStep 3. Use the ip address address mask interface subcommand to assign an IP \\naddress to the tunnel interface, using a subnet from the secure network’s address range. The two routers on the tunnel should use addresses from the same subnet.\\nStep 4. Configure the tunnel’s source IP address in the unsecured part of the network \\nin one of two ways. Regardless of the method, the local router’s source IP address must match the other router’s tunnel destination.\\nStep 4A.  Use the tunnel source ip-address tunnel interface subcommand to \\ndirectly set the tunnel’s source IP address. \\nStep 4B.  Use the tunnel source interface-id tunnel interface subcommand to \\nindirectly set the tunnel’s source IP address by referencing an inter-face on the local router. Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  403\\nStep 5. Use the tunnel destination {ip-address | hostname} command to configure \\nthe tunnel’s destination IP address in the unsecured part of the network. (This \\nvalue must match the IP address used by the other router as its tunnel source IP address.)\\nStep 6. Add routes that use the tunnel by enabling a dynamic routing protocol on the \\ntunnel or by configuring    static IP routes.\\nAs usual, an example can help quite a bit. The example, as you probably guessed, matches \\nthe example used throughout the last several pages, as shown in Figures 15-9 through 15-14. Figure 15-16 repeats all the interface numbers and IP addresses for reference. R1 and R2 form a tunnel using public addresses 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2, respectively, in the unsecured network (the Internet). The tunnel uses private subnet 10.1.3.0/24, with R1 and R2 using IP addresses 10.1.3.1 and 10.1.3.2, respectively. Example 15-1 shows the configuration on R1, and Example 15-2 shows the configuration on R2.\\n10.1.1.1PC1 10.1.1.9S1\\n10.1.2.210.1.2.9\\n1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2R2 R1\\nS0/0/0 S0/0/1The InternetG0/0 G0/010.1.3.2 10.1.3.1\\nTunnel0 Tunnel1\\nFigure 15-16 Summary Diagram for Upcoming GRE Examples\\nExample 15-1 Tunnel Configuration on R1\\nR1# show running-config\\n!

R2’s S0/0/1 \\ninterface has been configured with IP address 2.2.2.2. Then, under interface tunnel 1, the tunnel source Serial0/0/1 command refers to that same interface, making R2’s source IP address for the tunnel 2.2.2.2. Finally, referring back up to R1’s configuration, its tunnel destination 2.2.2.2 command clearly refers to the same IP address used by R2 as its source address. The same trail can be checked for R1’s source address of 1.1.1.1 and R2’s destina-tion address 1.1.1.1.\\nNote also that IOS supports a variety of tunnel modes, each of which can change the encap-\\nsulation used on the tunnel as well as changing some other behaviors. The example shows the tunnel mode gre ip command   just to let you see the command, although this command \\nconfigures the default setting. That default setting tells IOS to use the encapsulation as shown in Figure 15-12: a delivery header that uses IP (that is, IPv4), with a GRE header to follow. \\nAlthough this chapter does not happen to include configurations that use other tunnel \\nmode command options, it is easy to understand a few other options. For instance, a tunnel \\nmode gre ipv6 command would be used to create a point-to-point GRE tunnel that uses IPv6 to encapsulate the packets instead of IPv4. As another example, the command tunnel \\nmode gre multipoint is used when configuring Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN), a topic discussed      to a conceptual level later in this chapter. \\nVerifying a GRE Tunnel\\nThe ultimate test of the tunnel is whether it can pass end-user traffic. However, some other show commands from the router tell    us a lot about the status before trying a ping or trace-route from the user’s device.\\nFirst, because the tunnel acts very much like a serial link, with interfaces on both routers, \\nthe usual commands that list interface status, IP addresses, and IP routes all show informa-tion about the GRE tunnel. For instance, Example 15-3 shows the     familiar show ip interface \\nbrief command on R1, with R1’s Tunnel0 interface highlighted.\\nExample 15-3 Displaying the Interface State and IP Addresses, Including the Tunnel \\nInterface\\nR1# show ip interface brief\\nInterface                  IP-Address OK?

Example 15-4 lists a sample, again for \\nR1’s Tunnel0 interface. Note that it lists the local router (R1) configuration of the source (1.1.1.1) and destination (2.2.2.2) IP addresses, and it confirms    the use of GRE encapsulation over IP (IPv4), as highlighted in the example.\\nExample 15-4 Tunnel Interface Details\\nR1# show interfaces tunnel0\\nTunnel0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Hardware is Tunnel\\n  Internet address is 10.1.3.1/24\\n  MTU 17916 bytes, BW 100 Kbit/sec, DLY 50000 usec,     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation TUNNEL, loopback not set\\n  Keepalive not set\\n  Tunnel source 1.1.1.1 (Serial0/0/0), destination 2.2.2.2   Tunnel Subblocks:\\nsrc-track:\\nTunnel0 source tracking subblock associated with Serial0/0/0\\nSet of tunnels with source Serial0/0/0, 1 member (includes iterators), on \\ninterface <OK>\\n  Tunnel protocol/transport GRE/IP\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nAlthough a working tunnel interface is important, the routers will not use the tunnel inter-\\nface unless routes try to forward packets over the tunnel interface. The configuration in this example shows that OSPF has been enabled on all interfaces in Class A network 10.0.0.0, the secure part of the internetwork. As a result, the routers should exchange OSPF routes and learn the same routes shown earlier in Figure 15-10. Example 15-5 shows      proof, with R1 listing an OSPF-learned route to R2’s LAN subnet of 10.1.2.0/24.\\nExample 15-5 R1 Routes in Network 10.0.0.0\\nR1# show ip route 10.0.0.0\\nRouting entry for 10.0.0.0/8, 5 known subnets\\n  Attached (4 connections)\\n  Variably subnetted with 2 masks\\nC 10.1.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0L 10.1.1.9/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nO 10.1.2.0/24 [110/1001] via 10.1.3.2, 00:07:55, Tunnel0\\nC 10.1.3.0/24 is directly connected, Tunnel0\\nL 10.1.3.1/32 is directly connected, Tunnel0!

Example 15-6 shows an extended traceroute, sourced from R1’s LAN IP address of 10.1.1.9, and sent to server 1’s 10.1.2.2 IP address.\\nExample 15-6 Extended Traceroute Shows the Tunnel Is Working\\nR1# traceroute\\nProtocol [ip]:\\nTarget IP address: 10.1.2.2\\nSource address: 10.1.1.9\\nNumeric display [n]:Timeout in seconds [3]:\\nProbe count [3]:\\nMinimum Time to Live [1]:\\nMaximum Time to Live [30]:Port Number [33434]:\\nLoose, Strict, Record, Timestamp, Verbose[none]:\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nTracing the route to 10.1.2.2VRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id)\\n  1 10.1.3.2 0 msec 4 msec 0 msec\\n  2 10.1.2.2 4 msec 4 msec 0 msec\\nR1#\\nExample 15-6 shows that the traceroute completes, and it also lists R2’s tunnel IP address \\n(10.1.3.2) as the first router in the route. Note that the traceroute command does not list any routers in the unsecure part of the network, because the packets created      by the traceroute command get encapsulated and sent from R1 to R2, just like any other packet.\\nTroubleshooting GRE Tunnels\\nIn its most basic form, the configuration    for a point-to-point GRE tunnel between two Cisco routers is simple. You refer to your own public IP address, either directly or by ref-erencing an interface. You refer to the destination router, either by IP address or hostname. And you probably will configure some private IP addresses to make use of the tunnel. That is all you need to do to make a GRE tunnel work, assuming everything else works, such as the Internet connections on both ends.\\nFrom that summary, it may seem like there is little to discuss for troubleshooting GRE. This \\nsection takes a few pages to work through a couple of items that could prevent a GRE tun-nel from working, going a bit beyond a configuration mistake in the relatively sparse GRE configuration.\\nTunnel Interfaces and Interface State\\nThe first and easiest configuration       item to check is to make sure that the two routers refer to the correct IP addresses in the unsecure part of the network (typically the Internet). These are the addresses referenced by the     tunnel source and tunnel destination commands. \\nEarlier, Figure 15-15 showed the idea: The source address on one router should be the des-tination address on the other, and vice versa.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  407\\nOf all the items that must be true before a point-to-point GRE tunnel works correctly, most, \\nbut not all, are tied to the tunnel interface state. For the tunnel to work, the tunnel interfac-es on the endpoint routers must both reach an up/up state. To         reach an up/up state, a tunnel interface must be configured with a tunnel source command and a tunnel destination com-mand. Additionally, the following must be true of the tunnel source:\\n1. If configuring the tunnel source command by referencing a source interface, the\\ninterface must\\n■ Have an IP address assigned to it\\n■ Be in an up/up state\\n2. If configuring the tunnel source command by referencing a source IP address, the\\naddress must\\n■ Be an address assigned to an interface on the local router\\n■ Be in an up/up state for that interface on which the address is configured\\nIn short, however it is referenced, the tunnel source must be an IP address on the local \\nrouter on a currently working interface. If that is not true, the tunnel interface will remain in an up/down state. (Note that when a tunnel interface is created, it begins with an up/down state, because it has neither a tunnel source nor tunnel destination configured by default.)\\nA router’s tunnel interface state is also impacted by the tunnel destination configuration, \\nbut those details can be a little trickier. Some settings cause IOS to accept the configuration, but cause the tunnel interface to not reach an up/up state. Other incorrect tunnel \\ndestination configuration settings cause IOS to reject the         configuration. Those checks are\\n1. If configuring the tunnel destination command by referencing a destination IP\\naddress, the router\\n■ Must have a matching route to the destination address, or IOS will not move the\\ntunnel interface to an up/up state\\n■ May use its default route as the matching route\\n2. If configuring the tunnel destination command by referencing a hostname, the routerimmediately attempts to resolve the name into an address per its name resolution set-tings. If:\\n■ The hostname does not resolve to an IP address, IOS rejects the tunnel\\ndestination command and does not store it in the configuration.\\n■ The hostname does resolve to an IP address, IOS stores that IP address in the\\ntunnel destination command in the configuration, and does not store thehostname. Then the earlier rules about the tunnel destination IP address apply.\\nBasically, if you configure using a hostname, IOS immediately resolves the name, and if \\nname resolution works, IOS stores the address, not the name. Then, for the tunnel interface to reach an up/up state, the router must have a route that matches the tunnel destination.\\nExample 15-7 shows a few samples to drive home the points about the tunnel destination. \\nThe example shows the configuration of two tunnel interfaces, both with the same source interface. The source interface meets all requirements. Focusing on the tunnel destination, \\nptg17396363408  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nthe configuration uses two different hostnames         with the following tunnel destination com-\\nmands: \\ntunnel destination test1: Resolves to 10.1.6.1, which also has a matching route\\ntunnel destination test2: Name does not resolve\\nExample 15-7 Examples of Using Hostnames with Tunnels\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The configu-\\nration on interface tunnel 11 uses a hostname (test1). The show running-config interface tunnel11 command reveals that the router resolved that name to address 10.1.6.1. Finally, the show ip interface brief command at the bottom of the example reveals that interface \\ntunnel 11 reaches an up/up state. (Not shown: there is a route that matches 10.1.6.1.) \\nNow focus on interface tunnel 12. In the         configuration section, note that the tunnel \\ndestination test2 command was rejected by IOS. The message stating “Translating test2” \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  409\\nmeans that it is doing name resolution, and that process fails. Because hostname test2 did \\nnot resolve to an IP address, the tunnel destination test2 command was rejected; note that the show running-config interface tunnel12 command does not list a tunnel destination \\ncommand. Finally, the show ip interface brief command at the end of the example shows that interface tunnel 12 remains in an up/down state, because it does not yet have a tunnel destination configured.\\nLayer 3 Issues for Tunnel Interfaces\\nGetting both routers’ tunnel interfaces       to an up/up state is an important starting point. However, even once both routers have an up/up tunnel interface, other problems can exist. For instance, routers do not send packets to each other to test the tunnel to determine whether to put the tunnel in an up/up state.\\nTwo tests give some great clues about whether the tunnel is really working:\\n■Ping the private IP address on the other end of the tunnel. For that to work, both rout-\\ners’ tunnel interfaces must be in an up/up state. Additionally, both routers must be able\\nto place the packet into a GRE header, add a new IP header, forward over the tunnel,and remove the original packet.\\n■Enable a routing protocol on both ends of the tunnel. If a routing protocol neighbor\\nrelationship is formed, that also proves that packets can flow over the tunnel.\\nIssues with ACLs and Security\\nAlmost every networking feature can       then be broken by access control lists (ACL) and other \\nsecurity features like firewalls. In the case of Internet VPNs using GRE tunnels, those tun-nels have endpoints at the edge of an enterprise network, but the tunnel itself runs through the Internet. So, not only can the enterprise’s own devices filter traffic that makes the GRE tunnel fail, other devices not in direct control of the enterprise network engineer might also be filtering packets that impact the GRE tunnel.\\nFor the part of the network in the control of the enterprise network engineer, you should \\nbe ready to notice issues with ACLs. In particular, the GRE protocol can be easily over-looked and discarded by an ACL, even an ACL on the router where the tunnel is config-ured.\\nFirst, as you will review later in Chapter 17, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists,” an \\noutbound ACL on a router does not filter packets that the same router creates. That rule applies for the new packets created by a GRE tunnel. As a result, a router that is a GRE tun-nel endpoint will not filter the packets it creates to send over the tunnel, at least with an outbound ACL on that same router. \\nHowever, routers do not bypass any ACL logic for inbound ACLs. Routers will look at all \\ninbound packets, so a router might filter GRE packets entering the router, depending on the matching logic in the ACL.\\nSo, the first item when thinking about GRE and possible ACL issues is to find inbound \\nACLs on one of the tunnel routers. The second is to make sure the GRE traffic is permitted by those ACLs and any others in the network, and GRE is a bit different compared to some other protocols.\\nptg17396363410  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGRE is not a TCP or UDP application. Instead, GRE acts like another transport protocol in \\nthat the GRE header follows the IPv4 header, like TCP and UDP. The IP header identifies the next protocol after the header with the IP header’s protocol field, as noted       in Figure 15-17.\\nIdentifies Next HeaderIP Header Next Header\\nMiscellaneous\\nHeader\\nFieldsProtocol\\nTypeHeader\\nChecksumSource IP\\nAddressDestination\\nIP AddressOptions9 1 2 44 Variable\\nTCP, UDP\\nICMP, GRE,\\nEIGRP, IGMP,…\\nGRE = 47, TCP = 6, UDP = 17...\\nFigure 15-17 GRE Shown as the Next Header After IP, as IP Protocol 47\\nIP ACLs match the IP protocol field with a series of keywords, with the ip keyword \\nmatching all the protocols. That is the most common mistake. An ACL could have dozens of   permit commands, with permit tcp this, and permit udp that, and none of those would match GRE. GRE is a different IP protocol, and is not a TCP or UDP application. To match GRE with a permit command, the ACL needs to\\n■Have a permit ip … command that matches the GRE tunnel’s unsecured (public) address-\\nes, or…\\n■Have a permit gre … command (which matches the GRE protocol specifically) that also\\nmatches the GRE tunnel’s unsecured (public) IP addresses\\nExample 15-8 shows some pseudocode for an ACL added to Router R1 that explicitly permits GRE. First, it has a couple of pseudocode permit commands that use permit tcp and permit udp, to represent the kinds of matching you would do for other purposes. No \\nmatter what was configured in those commands, they could not match the GRE traffic. The permit gre any any command then matches all GRE packets from all sources and       destina-tions, matching GRE (IP protocol 47).\\nExample 15-8 ACL That Correctly Permits GRE\\nR1# configure terminal\\nR1(config)# ip access-list extended inbound-from-Internet\\nR1(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp (whatever you want)\\nR1(config-ext-nacl)# permit udp (whatever you want)\\nR1(config-ext-nacl)# permit gre any anyR1(config-ext-nacl)# interface S0/0/0\\nR1(config-if)# ip access-group inbound-from-Internet in\\nR1(config-if)# ^Z\\nR1#\\nMultipoint Internet VPNs Using DMVPN\\nSite-to-site VPNs with GRE work well, but the point-to-point topology has some shortcom-\\nings. For instance, consider a company with a central site and hundreds of small retail sites. Those retail sites need Internet access as well as a private WAN to connect back to the \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  411\\ncentral site. Given the relatively low pricing of Internet access options, the company decides \\nto implement a plan with using the Internet as a WAN, using site-to-site VPN tunnels   with GRE and IPsec. Figure 15-18 shows the general idea.\\nAny Internet\\nAccess Technology....R1\\nR4R3R2\\nFigure 15-18 Enterprise WAN with Site-to-Site Internet VPN\\nUsing GRE tunnels on a large scale has some drawbacks, mainly related to the static con-\\nfiguration, the fact that the central site device has a tunnel   interface and configuration per tunnel, and the traffic flow. In particular: \\n■With static configuration on both ends of each GRE tunnel, adding a new remote site\\nmeans that you also have to add configuration at the central site.\\n■The central site configuration can get large due to the per-tunnel configuration.\\n■The traffic flow works well for networks in which most traffic goes between the hub-\\nand-spoke sites, but if the spoke (remote) sites want to send packets to each other, the\\nnetwork engineer must either\\n■Allow routing to send spoke-to-spoke packets through the hub\\n■Manually conﬁ  gure tunnels between spoke sites so that the spokes can send packetsdirectly to each other (which adds even more conﬁ  guration to manage).\\nThe Cisco Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) IOS feature solves these problems while \\nstill using GRE and IPsec. Focusing    on the word multipoint for a moment, DMVPN uses a multipoint GRE tunnel. With a multipoint tunnel, a site can send and receive with any other site on the same multipoint tunnel. Figure 15-19 shows    a drawing meant to represent a mul-tipoint GRE tunnel.\\nptg17396363412  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n10.1.55.1\\nAHubSpokes\\n10.1.55.2\\nB\\n10.1.55.3\\nC\\n10.1.55.4\\nDR4R3 R1R2\\nFigure 15-19 Multipoint VPN Tunnel with DMVPN\\nDMVPN does more than use a multipoint GRE tunnel instead of a point-to-point tunnel. To \\nreduce configuration, and make the operation more dynamic, DMVPN adds some dynamic processes. Those processes rely on a protocol     called Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), which works as follows:\\n1. One site on the tunnel acts as the hub site and as NHRP server.\\n2. The spoke sites initially can communicate only with the hub site.\\n3. The hub sites (as NHRP clients) register their matching public and private IP addresses\\nwith the NHRP server (using NHRP protocol messages). (This is a key step in avoidingany configuration on the hub router for each new hub site added to the network.)\\nFigure 15-20 shows an example of the process. Router R1, as the hub, has only a little \\nconfiguration, including the configuration that sets aside an unsecure (public) IP address to use to send packets over the Internet, and the tunnel interface private IP address. However, the NHRP server (the hub router) learns the information and stores it in an NHRP mapping table, as shown in Figure 15-20 on the lower left. The figure shows an example of R3 regis-tering its private IP address (10.1.55.3) and public IP address (C). (Note that the figure uses A, B, C, and D to represent the public IP addresses; the actual addresses would be assigned by the ISPs    to which each site connects.)\\nSo far in this DMVPN discussion, the hub router now has one tunnel interface to talk to \\nmany hub sites, rather than one tunnel interface per site. Also, the hub site does not need to configure any commands to support a new spoke site, because NHRP learns the relevant information. However, the discussion so far has not yet shown how DMVPN allows spokes to send packets directly to each other without any configuration about the other spoke.\\nUsing the network in Figure 15-20 as an example, imagine that spoke Router R2 needs to \\nsend IP packets to subnets off spoke Router R3. R2 will use a routing protocol, and learn routes for those subnets. Router R2 learns about the subnets at R3’s sites, but R2 does not know R3’s public IP address. How can R2 learn R3’s unsecure (public) IP address, and do so dynamically, without having to configure that setting? The solution is simple: The NHRP server already knows all that information, so just ask the NHRP server. Figure 15-21 shows \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  413\\nthe idea, the hub    router R1 using NHRP messages to announce R3’s public and private \\naddress pair to the other spoke sites.\\n10.1.55.1\\nA10.1.55.2\\nB\\n10.1.55.3\\nNHRP Register\\nPublic   Tunnel\\nB   10.1.55.2\\nC   10.1.55.3D   10.1.55.4Public = CTunnel = 10.1.55.3\\nNHRP Mappings:C\\n10.1.55.4\\nD\\nR4R3 R1R2Public   Tunnel\\nA   10.1.55.1Config\\nFigure 15-20 Spoke Site Registers with NHRP Server to Enable Dynamic Mapping\\n10.1.55.1\\nA10.1.55.2\\nB\\n10.1.55.3\\nNHRP:\\nTunnel is 10.1.55.3Public is C C\\n10.1.55.4\\nDR4R3 R1R2\\n1\\n2Public   Tunnel\\nA   10.1.55.1Config\\nPublic   TunnelB   10.1.55.2\\nC   10.1.55.3D   10.1.55.4NHRP Mappings:\\nFigure 15-21 Spoke Sites Learning Information with NHRP to Enable Spoke-to-Spoke \\nCommunication\\nOnce Router R2 knows Router R3’s tunnel and public IP addresses, R2 has enough informa-\\ntion to start sending packets directly to R3 over the multipoint GRE tunnel.\\nPPP over Ethernet\\nThis third and final major section of the chapter revisits a familiar protocol: Point-to-Point Protocol, or PPP. While PPP    is used on serial links, as shown in Chapter 13, “Implementing Point-to-Point WANs,” it is also used over some types of Internet access links, like DSL links, by extending the PPP protocol using PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE). PPPoE keeps    all the \\nptg17396363414  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nuseful PPP features, like its different control protocols, as well as PPP authentication like \\nCHAP. However, the PPP protocol is transported inside Ethernet frames out Ethernet inter-faces.\\nThe Cisco R&S and ICND2 200-105 exam topics list PPPoE Client functions as a topic to \\nbe covered for not only concepts, but also configuration, verification, and troubleshooting. This last major section of the chapter mirrors those verbs from the exam topics, with four subheadings, one each on PPPoE concepts, configuration, verification, and then trouble-shooting.\\nPPPoE Concepts\\nPPP was originally used on serial links, which includes those links created with dial-up analog and ISDN modems. For instance, the link from a dial user to an ISP, using analog modems, likely uses PPP today, and has for a long time. Figure 15-22    shows a basic repre-sentation of that analog dial connection with a modem that uses PPP.\\nPPP IP Packet10.1.1.110.1.3.2 10.1.3.1\\nR2 R11ISP\\nCustomer\\nFigure 15-22 PPP Frames Between Routers over a Dial Connection to an ISP\\nISPs used PPP as the data link protocol for a couple of reasons. First, PPP supports a way to assign IP addresses to the other end of the PPP link. ISPs can use PPP to assign each customer one public IPv4 address to use. But more important for this discussion is that PPP supports CHAP, and ISPs often want to use CHAP to authenticate customers. Then, when using CHAP to authenticate, ISPs could check accounting records to determine whether the customer’s bill was paid before letting the customer connect to the Internet.\\nNow, think back a bit to the history of some of these Internet access technologies. ISPs in \\nthe 1990s had mostly dial customers using analog modems and PPP. Even into the 2000s, ISPs still had analog dial customers using PPP. However, by the early 2000s, DSL was becoming more common in the market, and DSL is a natural replacement for analog dial.\\nSo, telcos and ISPs liked analog dial with PPP, but they wanted to move customers to the \\nfaster DSL…and they still wanted to use PPP! However, the DSL connect often connects a customer device (PC or router) with an Ethernet link to a DSL modem, which then connects to the phone line (see earlier Figure 15-2). That Ethernet interface on the customer PC or router only supported Ethernet data link protocols, and not PPP.\\nThe solution was to create a new RFC that defined how to send PPP frames over Ethernet, \\nencapsulated in an Ethernet frame, with the protocol   called PPP over Ethernet. PPPoE basi-cally creates a tunnel through the DSL connection for the purpose of sending PPP frames between the customer router and the ISP router, as shown in Figure 15-23. \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  415\\nTunnel10.1.1.110.1.3.1 10.1.3.2\\nR2 R11PPP TunnelISP\\nPPP IP PacketCustomer\\nFigure 15-23 Tunneling Concept to Create a PPP Link over Ethernet\\nDSL does not create a single point-to-point physical link between the customer router and \\nthe ISP router, but it does create a logical equivalent called   a PPPoE session. With PPPoE (and related protocols), the routers logically create such a tunnel. From one perspective, the routers create and send PPP frames, as if the link were a dial link between the routers. But before sending the frames over any physical link, the routers encapsulate the frames inside various headers, shown generically in the figure as a tunnel header.\\nNOTE For the purposes of this chapter, the specifics of the tunnel header shown in Figure 15-23 do not matter. However, the PPPoE tunnel header in this case has a typical Ethernet header, a short PPPoE header, and then the usual PPP frame (which includes the IP packet).\\nPPPoE Configuration\\nPPPoE configuration and verification    can be a bit challenging compared to some other rout-er features discussed in this book. You configure PPPoE in a couple of different configura-tion modes. Then, once configured, PPPoE dynamically adds some important components as well. So it is important to take your time through the PPPoE configuration and verifica-tion sections.\\nThe rest of this section uses a physical topology as shown in Figure 15-24. It uses two rout-\\ners with a crossover Ethernet cable between them. Note that while it does not use DSL, the PPPoE concepts and configuration still work the same on the customer side. \\nR2 R1G0/2 G0/2 G0/1Customer ISP\\nG0/1 Layer 2\\nNo IP Addresses0200.0000.0022 0200.0000.0011\\nFigure 15-24 Network Used for PPPoE Examples\\nNote that IP is not enabled on the link between the routers. That is, neither router has an ip address subcommand on its Ethernet interface for that link in the middle. As a result, the routers treat the link as a Layer 2 link. But something else in the router has to make the router want to send the frames out those interfaces, and that is where the PPPoE configura-tion meets the physical interfaces.\\nptg17396363416  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo begin, Example 15-9 shows a completed PPPoE configuration on Router R1 that works. \\nIn this case, it follows this design:\\n■Use CHAP, with username Fred and password Barney.\\n■R1’s G0/1 interface connects to the ISP and is a Layer 2 interface (that is, it has no IP\\naddress configured).\\n■Use a dynamically assigned IP address as learned from the ISP using PPP’s IP Control\\nProtocol (IPCP).\\n■Optionally, but to make the later verification commands more obvious, define a recog-\\nnizable MAC address on the physical    interface.\\nExample 15-9 PPPoE Configuration on R1 (PPPoE Client)\\ninterface dialer 2\\n!

First, note that it uses a dialer inter-\\nface. Dialer interfaces have been in IOS for a long time, and Cisco has found a variety of features that make use of a dialer interface. Originally, IOS used dialer interfaces when a router used dial-up technology to make a phone call to another device to set up a physical link, so the name comes from the ancient telephony term of dialing on a rotary telephone.\\nToday, dialer interfaces act as logical interfaces that can be dynamically bound to use another \\ninterface. These interfaces cooperate to perform a function. For instance, for PPPoE, the dialer interface holds configuration for IP and PPP, but it is not a physical Ethernet interface. So, to let the dialer interface use G0/1 as the physical interface in this scenario:\\n■The configuration puts interface G0/1 into a dial pool, specifically numbered dial pool 1,\\nper the pppoe-client dial-pool-number 1 command. This command means that G0/1 is\\navailable to be used by dialer interfaces wanting to do PPPoE.\\n■Dialer interface 2 references dial pool number 1 with the dialer-pool 1 command.\\nBecause the dial pool number matches, interface dialer 2 will use G0/1 for PPPoE.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  417\\nNote that the dialer interface number (2 in this case) and dialer pool number (1 in this case) \\ndo not have to match. The customer network engineer can just choose an integer value to use; they do not have to match the ISP router. However, the dial pool number listed by the     dialer-pool command on the dialer interface, and the dial pool number listed by the \\npppoe-client dial-pool-number subcommand on the physical interface, must match.\\nThe configuration of the dial pool gives the logical dialer interface a physical interface to \\nuse, so it is in some ways a physical layer (Layer 1) feature. In fact, you can break down all of Example 15-9’s configuration into groupings by Layers 1, 2, and 3, a theme carried       through the rest of this section. Figure 15-25 shows the commands versus the layers.\\nInterface Dialer 2\\nLayer 3\\nLayer 2\\nLayer 1Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/1\\nip address negotiated\\nmtu 1492no ip address\\nencapsulation pppppp chap hostname Fredppp chap password Barney\\nDialer pool 1 pppoe-client dial-pool-number 1(pppoe enable)pppoe enable\\nFigure 15-25 Breakdown of PPPoE Client Configuration on Router R1\\nPPPoE Configuration Breakdown: PPP and Layer 2\\nThe dialer interface holds the PPP configuration used to create the PPPoE session. Focusing \\nonly on the configuration for now, start with the dialer interface. The dialer uses PPP direct-ly, but not PPPoE. So, it needs the encapsulation ppp command         to define the data link pro-tocol. This is the same encapsulation ppp command you may remember from Chapter 13.\\nThe dialer typically includes PPP CHAP authentication as well, mainly because the session \\nhappens between an ISP and its customer. The configuration here for PPPoE differs slightly from the CHAP configuration shown back in Chapter 13. Here, the authentication hap-pens in one direction: the ISP authenticates the customer router, in this case R1. That small change in logic creates the small change in configuration. R1 simply needs to configure the username and password as shown.\\nFinally, the physical Ethernet interface (G0/1 in this example) does need one command to \\nenable PPPoE on the      interface: the pppoe enable subcommand. However, IOS adds this \\ncommand to the interface automatically if you configure the pppoe-client interface sub-\\ncommand. So, while Figure 15-25 shows the pppoe enable command in the Layer 1 section because it is automatically configured, it in effect enables PPPoE on the physical interface.\\nPPPoE Configuration Breakdown: Layer 3\\nThe Layer 3 configuration, as noted at the top of Figure 15-25, has a couple of surprising ideas compared to earlier IP addressing     commands. \\nptg17396363418  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFirst, the physical interface connected to the ISP (G0/1 in this example) has no IP address, \\nwill not learn an IP address, and does not need one for the duration of using PPPoE. Yes, IP traffic will be forwarded to and from the ISP in and out that physical interface, but not through enabling IP on the physical interface (G0/1 in this case). (Instead, the Layer 3 logic is applied to the dialer interface, which then uses the physical interface.) So the physical interface needs a no ip address command to make sure no address exists there.\\nSecond, the dialer interface serves as the primary Layer 3 interface for PPPoE. The dialer \\ninterface will be listed in the output of the show ip route command as an outgoing inter-face, and the dialer interface can be referenced in commands that define static routes. In fact, if the customer router in this example wanted to use a default route to forward packets to the Internet, it might be configured with ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dialer 2. The command would not reference the physical Ethernet interface.\\nThe dialer interface does need an IP address. To dynamically learn an address, PPPoE uses \\nPPP’s IPCP rather than DHCP. To cause that to happen, the customer router (R1) uses the   ip address negotiated command, which is the IOS command that means “use PPP IPCP to negotiate an address.” Note that if the customer wants to use a static IP address, maybe one assigned by the ISP so that the GRE configuration is stable, the address could be configured with the usual ip address address mask interface subcommand.\\nFinally, as an important housekeeping item, set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for IP packets to 1492 as shown with the mtu 1492 interface subcommand. Normally, the IP MTU defaults to 1500. PPPoE adds another 8-byte header, reducing by 8 bytes the space for the IP packet, so reducing the IP MTU to 1492 prevents the router from having to do unnecessary     work to fragment packets. \\nPPPoE Configuration Summary\\nThis section introduced the commands    to configure PPPoE in the context of a single exam-ple. The following configuration checklist summarizes the configuration for easier review and study.\\nStep 1. Configure Layer 1 details.\\nStep 1A. Configure a dialer interface:\\nI.  Use the interface dialer number command to create the dialer \\ninterface; choose a number not already used on the local router by \\nsome other dialer interface. \\nII.  Use the dialer-pool number interface subcommand to refer to a\\npool of Ethernet-family interfaces that can be used for PPPoE.\\nStep 1B. Configure the physical interface(s):\\nI.  Use the pppoe-client dial-pool-number number interface subcom-\\nmand to add the interface to the same pool number configured on the dialer interface. \\nStep 2. Configure Layer 2 details.\\nStep 2A.

Use the no ip address interface subcommand    to disable IP routing \\non the physical interface and remove the IPv4 address from the interface.\\nA Brief Aside About Lab Experimentation with PPPoE\\nFor most configuration topics in this book, you learn enough information to go into a lab \\nand configure a couple of routers and switches to make the feature work and then experi-ment with show commands. However, this chapter does not explain the details of the ISP’s PPPoE configuration, because the PPPoE exam topic states that it is about the client side only. And the configuration is not the same on both the customer and ISP routers.\\nHowever, for those of you who want to try to re-create the examples shown in this section \\nof the book, please do. To give you a start, use a configuration like Example 15-10 for the ISP; it is a copy of the relevant configuration from the router labeled R2 that was used when creating the upcoming examples. Then use a lab with a crossover Ethernet       cable between two routers, with a topology like Figure 15-24. \\nExample 15-10 ISP Router Configuration Sample\\nip local pool WOPool 10.1.3.2 10.1.3.254\\nbba-group pppoe WOGroup\\n virtual-template 1\\n!\\nusername Fred password Barney!\\ninterface virtual-template 1\\n  ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255.0\\n  peer default ip address pool WOPool  ppp authentication chap callin\\n!\\nptg17396363420  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/2\\n  no ip address\\n  pppoe enable group WOGroup\\n  no shutdown\\n  mac-address 0200.0000.0022\\nNOTE Check out the Config Lab section of my CCNA blog \\n(http://blog.certskills.com/ccna) for a couple of Config Labs about PPPoE.\\nPPPoE Verification\\nWhile PPPoE configuration has enough     detail to be a challenge, PPPoE verification has a few more challenges because of how PPPoE works internally in IOS. Before reviewing a bunch of command output, it helps to get an idea about those internals. So, consider the ideas in Figure 15-26. The figure shows the two familiar interfaces from the configuration section, namely, a dialer interface and Ethernet interface. It adds two boxes for discussion:\\nPPPoE Session: A reference to the IOS internal process that performs the PPPoE work \\nand keeps status variables for the PPPoE control protocols\\nVirtual-Access Interface: Another logical interface, dynamically created by IOS once the \\nPPPoE session is up and working, and bound to the dialer interface\\nDialer Interface\\nDial Pool #Bind\\nUpPPP Config\\npppoe enableBindVirtual-Access\\nInterfacePPPoE\\nSession\\nEthernet Interface12\\n3\\n24\\n4\\nFigure 15-26 PPPoE Verification Concepts and Interfaces\\nThe figure represents some big ideas with what IOS displays in PPPoE show commands. \\nWorking through the concepts represented in the figure can help you make more sense of the upcoming command output. Following the numbered steps in the figure:\\nStep 1. The dial interface and Ethernet interface are associated by referencing the \\nsame dial pool number in the configuration.\\nStep 2. Some part of IOS must act to implement PPP and the PPPoE specifics. Call this \\npart of IOS the PPPoE session, as represented on the far right of the figure. \\nThat box represents the IOS PPPoE session logic, status variables for the PPP Control Protocols (CP), and sends and receives the PPPoE messages to/from the ISP.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  421\\nStep 3. IOS creates a virtual-access interface if the PPPoE session reaches the desired \\nup state. This dynamically created interface acts as a PPPoE interface. The \\nvirtual-access interface holds much of the Layer 2 PPPoE operational settings and counters.\\nStep 4. The three interfaces in the figure are separate, but they work closely together, \\nand are considered to be bound together     for the purposes of PPPoE. Various show commands identify these bindings.\\nSummarizing the ideas about the interfaces, the physical interface sends Ethernet frames; \\nthe virtual-access interface (as the PPPoE interface) sends PPPoE frames by making use of the physical interface; and the dialer interface (as the Layer 3 interface) sends packets, relying on the PPPoE interface to encapsulate the packet and then send it out the physical interface.\\nWith those big ideas in mind, now take a look at some of the related show commands. \\nThe rest of this section assumes the topology shown in Figure 15-24 and the configuration \\nshown in Example 15-9. Note also that Figure 15-15 repeats the configuration in Example 15-9 but organizes the commands based on TCP/IP layers. The upcoming examples     list show command output taken when PPPoE was working correctly.\\nVerifying Dialer and Virtual-Access Interface Bindings\\nWith PPPoE, the output of the show interfaces dialer number command       has a lot of inter-\\nesting information. In particular:\\n■When a PPPoE session exists, the dialer interface is bound to a dynamically created\\nvirtual-access interface. As a result, the show interfaces dialer command lists output for\\nnot just one interface, but two: one group of about 20 output lines for the dialer inter-face, and another set for the virtual-access interface to which it is bound.\\n■Both sections of output list some information about binding to the other interface (dialer\\nbound to virtual-access, and vice versa).\\n■The dialer interface output confirms the Layer 3 focus of the dialer interface (listing the\\nIP address), but with PPP’s Link Control Protocol (LCP) closed.\\n■The virtual-access interface output confirms the Layer 2 focus of the interface, with\\nPPP’s LCP open, but with no IP address.\\nExample 15-11 shows the output from the   show interfaces dialer 2 command taken from \\ncustomer router R1. The highlighted lines are discussed following the example.\\nExample 15-11 Displaying the Dialer and Virtual-Access Interfaces\\nR1# show interfaces dialer 2 \\nDialer2 is up, line protocol is up (spoofing)\\n  Hardware is Unknown\\n  Internet address is 10.1.3.2/32\\n  MTU 1492 bytes, BW 56 Kbit/sec, DLY 20000 usec,      reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255\\n  Encapsulation PPP, LCP Closed, loopback not set\\n  Keepalive set (10 sec)\\nptg17396363422  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n  DTR is pulsed for 1 seconds on reset\\n  Interface is bound to Vi2\\n!

Counter lines removed for brevity\\nFirst off, PPPoE is working in this example. It shows the dialer interface with a line status \\nof up, and a line protocol status of “up (spoofing),” which is the normal working state. (The word  spoofing is a reference to the fact that the data link logic sits elsewhere, in this case \\non the virtual-access interface.) If you look about halfway down the output, you can find the second half of the output, about interface virtual-access 2. This interface has a line and protocol status of up and up, again which is the normal state when PPPoE is working.\\nAlso, it is important to note that Example 15-11 shows the output from one command only; \\nit just happens to list information about both the dialer interface and the bound virtual-access interface.\\nFocusing on the top half of the output, for the dialer interface, the output lists the con-\\nfigured IP MTU of 1492, and the learned IP address of 10.1.3.2. It shows the fact that it uses PPP encapsulation, but LCP is closed—the dialer interface (the Layer 3 interface) does not do the PPP work, so the output lists LCP as closed for this interface. Finally, the dialer interface output lines state that the dialer interface is bound to Vi2, which is shorthand for Virtual-access 2.\\nThe second half of the output, for interface Vi2, lists similar info. While it shows PPP in \\nuse, it also shows LCP as open, because this interface does the PPP/PPPoE functions, and LCP is part of PPP. However, the virtual-access interface has no Layer 3 function, so look for an IP address; there is none. The IP address sits on the dialer interface. Finally, the bottom of the output confirms that this interface is bound to Di2, which is shorthand for Dialer2.\\nNote that while the show interfaces dialer 2 command       lists information about the bound \\nvirtual-access interface (when PPPoE is working), you can also list the virtual-access inter-face details with a command like show interfaces virtual-access 2. \\nVerifying Virtual-Access Interface Configuration\\nThat one command in Example 15-11, show interfaces dialer 2, reveals many details about a working PPPoE session, including details about the dynamically created virtual-access \\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  423\\ninterface. This next short topic looks at how IOS builds       the configuration for that virtual-\\naccess interface.\\nInterestingly, IOS uses the dialer interface as a configuration template to build the virtual-\\naccess interface’s configuration. To see what IOS does, use the   show interfaces virtual-access 2 configuration command (or show int vi2 conf for short). This command shows the configuration for the dynamically created virtual-access interface, which copies some of the dialer interface configuration, as shown in Example 15-12. Working through the three commands in the example:\\n1. The first command is a reminder of the configuration of interface dialer 2, as seen\\nearlier in Example 15-9.\\n2. The second command, show interfaces virtual-access 2 configuration, shows the\\nIOS-generated configuration. Note the highlighted lines from the first command\\nare the ones that IOS copies to the configuration of the virtual-access interface.(Additionally, the first highlighted line is a great description of what the interfacedoes: it is the PPPoE interface.)\\n3. The third (last) command shows the running-config section for interface virtual-access\\n2. Note that the configuration file holds fewer commands, and does not include thePPP configuration that IOS dynamically pulls from the dialer interface.\\nExample 15-12 Displaying Layer 2 PPP Orientation of Virtual-Access Interface\\nR1# show running-config interface dialer 2\\nBuilding configuration…\\nCurrent configuration: 159 bytes\\n!interface Dialer 2\\n mtu 1492\\n ip address negotiated\\n encapsulation ppp dialer pool 1\\n ppp chap hostname Fred\\n ppp chap password 0 Barney\\n no cdp enable\\n!

When PPPoE starts on the customer router, it sends and receives PPPoE messages, including those for LCP, to decide whether the PPP session can work or not. Each router then keeps track of the status of the PPPoE state, which can be displayed with the   show pppoe session command.\\nFigure 15-27 shows a representation of the data found about the PPPoE session with the \\nshow pppoe session interface g0/1 command. In particular, it shows all three interfaces involved in making PPPoE work, along with the MAC address used by both devices. The figure organizes the information to act as a comparison to upcoming Example 15-13, which lists the same information.\\nR2\\n0200.0000.0022PPPoE\\nUP!\\n0200.0000.0011Customer Router R1\\nISP RouterDialer 2\\n(Di2)\\nVirtual-Access 2\\n(Vi2)\\nGigabit 0/1\\n(Gi0/1)\\nFigure 15-27 Details Found in Example 15-13 Output\\nExample 15-13 Connecting the Physical, Virtual-Access, Dialer, and PPPoE State\\nR1# show pppoe session interface gigabitEthernet 0/1\\n     1 client session \\nUniq ID  PPPoE  RemMAC          Port VT  VA State\\nSID  LocMAC VA-st Type\\n    N/A      1  0200.0000.0022  Gi0/1 Di2 Vi2 UP\\n0200.0000.0011 UP\\nNote that the show pppoe session command lists the same kind of information shown in \\nExample 15-13, but for all PPPoE sessions on the router. The show pppoe session interface gigabitethernet0/1 command in the example limits the output to a message       group for all PPPoE sessions off the listed interface (G0/1).\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  425\\nVerifying Dialer Interface Layer 3 Status\\nThe dialer interface acts as a Layer 3 interface       for the router in addition to being a configu-\\nration template for creating the virtual-access interface. So, the dialer interface should have an IP address. If learned dynamically, the address is typically learned with PPPoE, specifi-cally by IPCP. Additionally, all routes in the IP routing table will reference the dialer inter-face instead of the virtual-access or Ethernet interface used by PPPoE.\\nIn the continuing example in this section, two commands on customer router R1 confirm \\nthat the dialer has an IP address and that routes use the dialer interface. The show ip route \\ncommand     lists a connected route for both R1’s learned interface address of 10.1.3.2 and the neighboring ISP’s address of 10.1.3.1. PPP IPCP announces the address on the other end of the PPP link, so R1 learns R2’s IP address (10.1.3.1) and adds a connected route as shown, as shown in Example 15-14.\\nExample 15-14 Displaying Layer 3 Orientation of Dialer Interface\\nR1# show ip route\\n! Legend omitted for brevity\\n10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets, 2 masks\\nC 10.1.1.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2L 10.1.1.9/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/2\\nC 10.1.3.1/32 is directly connected, Dialer2\\nC 10.1.3.2/32 is directly connected, Dialer2     \\nR1# show ip interface brief dialer 2Interface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status Protocol\\nDialer2                    10.1.3.2        YES IPCP   up up    \\nThe second command in the example lists the one line in the show ip interface brief com-\\nmand output for the dialer interface. Note that it lists the address, but more importantly, it lists the method as “IPCP.” This is a confirmation that R1 learned the       address through PPPoE, specifically PPP’s IPCP.\\nPPPoE Troubleshooting\\nLike many networking features, the Layer 3 features    simply do not work if the Layer 2 function they rely upon has a problem. Similarly, a Layer 2 problem often cannot be noticed if the underlying Layer 1 also has problems. In most cases, if you have problems with the network, data link, and physical layers, you have to work from the lower layers up the stack to find the issues.\\nThis troubleshooting section takes a similar approach. Trying to cover every combination \\nof missing or incorrect PPPoE configuration, with the resulting differences in show com-mand output, would be pretty laborious. Instead, this section takes a structured approach to rebuild the configuration shown throughout the earlier PPPoE topics, specifically as listed in Example 15-9 and repeated in Figure 15-25. By configuring a few related commands and then stopping to show and discuss the current status, you can learn about what status to expect if a configuration omits some configuration or uses the wrong parameters on some configuration.\\nptg17396363426  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThis section builds the configuration on the dialer interface, plus on the physical interface, \\nin three different steps, as listed here. Note that the figure organizes the configuration based on TCP/IP Layers 1, 2, and 3, as outlined earlier in Figure 15-25 (repeated here as Figure 15-28 for convenience).\\nInterface Dialer 2\\nLayer 3\\nLayer 2\\nLayer 1Interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/1\\nip address negotiated\\nmtu 1492no ip address\\nencapsulation pppppp chap hostname Fredppp chap password Barney\\nDialer pool 1 pppoe-client dial-pool-number 1(pppoe enable)pppoe enable\\nFigure 15-28 PPPoE Client Configuration on Router R1 (Duplicate of Figure 15-25)\\nThe next few topics in this chapter work through an analysis of the status of PPPoE at vari-\\nous stages of configuration, until the configuration is completed, based on these steps. At each step, the text makes some comments to point out the key    facts about the current state. \\nStep 1. Add the Layer 1 configuration per Figure 15-28.\\nStep 2. Add the Layer 2 configuration per Figure 15-28.Step 3. Add the Layer 3 configuration per Figure 15-28.\\nStep 0: Status Before Beginning the First Step\\nThis troubleshooting scenario    begins with R1 having all default configuration in relation to \\nPPPoE, except that the configuration does begin with a few statements already on Router R1 (the customer router), as shown in Example 15-15. Note that the MAC address is set on the interface, for the sole purpose of making it easier to find in show command output. For the same reason, ISP Router R2 has been set to use MAC address 0200.0000.0022.\\nExample 15-15 Relevant Configuration on Customer Router (R1) at Beginning of \\nTroubleshooting\\nR1# show running-config interface gigabitethernet0/1\\nBuilding configuration...\\nCurrent configuration : 202 bytes\\n!interface GigabitEthernet0/1\\n mac-address 0200.0000.0011\\n no ip address\\nendR1# show running-config interface Dialer2\\nBuilding configuration...\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  427\\nCurrent configuration : 55 bytes\\n!\\ninterface Dialer2\\n no ip address\\nAdditionally, the dialer 2 interface has been created with the interface dialer 2 command, \\nbut with no further interface configuration commands added. The reason for configuring the dialer interface first, without other configuration, is to emphasize some details about the    dialer interface’s status.\\nThe interface status of a dialer interface, before adding any configuration at all, is different \\nthan the status of most any interface on a router or switch. You could configure the dialer interface with a shutdown command, and it would have an administratively disabled line status like any other router interface. However, the dialer interface is in a no shutdown state \\nby default.\\nWhen a dialer interface is not fully working, which is true when there are no subcommands \\nconfigured on the dialer interface, both the interface and protocol status will be “up (spoofing),” as shown in Example 15-16. The show ip interface brief command will list the two status codes (the interface status and the protocol status) both as up. However, the show interfaces command lists a longer status value of up (spoofing). (Note that the show \\ninterfaces dialer 2 | include line command filters the output to list only the line    with “line” in it.) \\nExample 15-16 Step 0: Status of Dialer 2 After Creation but with No Other \\nConfiguration\\nR1# show interfaces dialer 2 | include line\\nDialer2 is up (spoofing), line protocol is up (spoofing)\\nR1# show ip interface brief dialer 2\\nInterface                  IP-Address      OK? Method Status Protocol\\nDialer2                    unassigned      YES unset  up up  \\nR1# show pppoe session \\nR1# \\nAt the bottom of the output, the show pppoe session command implies that PPPoE is not \\nworking yet, because it returns no lines of output. With PPPoE working, this command lists a small group of output lines for every PPPoE session on the router.\\nStep 1: Status After Layer 1 Configuration\\nThe bottom of Figure 15-28 shows commands     labeled as Layer 1. This next section begins by adding those commands to the router. Specifically:\\n1. The dialer pool 1 command is added under the dialer interface.\\n2. The pppoe-client dial-pool-number 1 command is added under interface G0/1.\\n3. IOS automatically adds the pppoe enable command under interface G0/1.\\nptg17396363428  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAt this point, the dialer interface has referenced a pool, and an Ethernet interface is in the \\npool (G0/1 in this case), so the dialer interface has a physical interface to use. Example 15-17 confirms that the dialer and physical interfaces can now work together (Layer 1), but that PPPoE (Layer 2) does not yet work. Of particular note in this case:\\n■The dialer interface state is still up (spoofing). The interface state will remain in this state\\nuntil PPPoE is functional.\\n■R1 is at least trying to create a PPPoE session because of the automatic configuration of\\nthe pppoe enable command on G0/1. Now the show pppoe session command lists some\\nevidence of that attempt. However, if you compare the highlighted items to the working\\noutput in Example 15-12, you will see\\n■The state is not up (it is PADISNT).\\n■It does not list a V A (virtual-access) interface, listing instead N/A for “not applicable.”\\n■It lists placeholders for the MAC addresses (all 0s) at this point, which     are not the ad-dresses used by the routers.\\nExample 15-17 Status After Step 1: Layer 1 Configuration (Per Figure 15-28)\\nR1# show interfaces dialer 2 | include line\\nDialer2 is up (spoofing), line protocol is up (spoofing)\\nR1# show pppoe session \\n  1 client session \\nUniq ID  PPPoE  RemMAC          Port VT  VA State\\nSID  LocMAC VA-st Type\\n    N/A      0  0000.0000.0000  Gi0/1 Di2 N/A PADISNT \\n0000.0000.0000    \\nAlso, the example does not bother to look at the Layer 3 information, like the dialer inter-\\nface IP address and connected routes. Because PPPoE still does not     work (Layer 2), the Layer 3 address discovery could not yet have worked either.\\nStep 2: Status After Layer 2 (PPP) Configuration\\nPer the Figure 15-28 comments about Layer 2, at this step, R1 next     adds three PPP com-mands to the dialer interface: encapsulation ppp, ppp chap hostname Fred, and ppp chap \\npassword Barney. This new configuration completes all PPP and PPPoE configuration for R1, so the PPPoE session should work The output in Example 15-18 confirms many facts about a working PPPoE design, including:\\n■The dialer 2 interface state is up instead of up (spoofing). (The protocol state remains up\\n(spoofing) even when all is working.)\\n■The show pppoe session command lists a state of UP.\\n■The show pppoe session command lists all three key interfaces: dialer 2 (Di2), virtual-\\naccess 1 (Vi1), and GigabitEthernet0/1 (Gi0/1).\\n■The show pppoe session command lists the MAC addresses of the local and ISP router.\\nptg1739636315Chapter 15: Private WANs with Internet VPN  429\\nExample 15-18 Status After Step 3: Layer 2 Configuration (Per Figure 15-28)\\nR1# show interfaces dialer 2 | include line\\nDialer2 is up, line protocol is up (spoofing)\\nR1# show pppoe session interface g0/1\\n  1 client session \\nUniq ID  PPPoE  RemMAC          Port VT  VA State\\nSID  LocMAC VA-st Type\\n    N/A     35  0200.0000.0022  Gi0/1 Di2 Vi1 UP\\n0200.0000.0011 UP\\nAlthough not shown here, now that PPPoE is up, the show interfaces dialer 2 command \\nwould list two groups of messages: the first set for the dialer interface, and the second set for interface Vi1. Before the PPPoE session comes up and binds the Vi1 interface to Di2, the show interfaces dialer 2 command would list messages for dialer 2 only. (See Example \\n15-11 for an example of this output.)\\nProblems still exist. At this point, the configuration for Layers 1 and 2 has been added and \\nthe functions have been verified, but the Layer 3 configuration has not yet been added. To confirm those issues before adding the configuration, Example 15-19 shows the status of the dialer interface’s IPv4 address and the lack of associated IP routes that result. Note that the dialer interface has no IP address assigned, and there are no routes listing dialer 2 as an outgoing     interface; only G0/2, an interface ignored for this lab, is listed as an outgoing interface.\\nExample 15-19 Layer 3 Status After Step 2, with No IP Configuration for the Dialer \\nInterface\\nR1# show ip interface brief dialer 2\\nInterface                  IP-Address      OK?

This step adds two commands to interface dialer 2, namely the ip address negotiated and mtu 1492 commands. (The third command for Layer 3 in Figure 15-28, the no ip address \\ncommand for interface G0/1, was preconfigured as noted earlier in Example 15-15.) \\nAt this point, all should be working properly. The configuration for this troubleshooting \\nscenario should exactly match Example 15-9 and Figure 15-28, which is the same configura-tion used to gather all the verification commands shown in Examples 15-11 through 15-14. Rather than repeat all those commands again, feel free to refer to those examples to review the status shown when all is working well. For the Layer 3 status, make sure and review Example 15-14, which shows the Layer 3 status on the dialer interface.\\nptg17396363430  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPPPoE Troubleshooting Summary\\nThe sections about PPPoE verification and troubleshooting show a lot of command exam-\\nples. This section summarizes a few suggestions for    what to look for to help with review and exam preparation.\\nLayer 1: If the show pppoe session [interface type number] command does not list out-\\nput, or does not list both the physical and dialer interfaces, check for the existence of the \\nLayer 1 commands as noted in Figure 15-28. Check for errors in those commands as well; for instance, the dial pool numbers must match. Also check to make sure both the dialer and physical interfaces are not shut down. (See Example 15-16.)\\nLayer 2: If the show pppoe session [interface type number] command does list output, \\nand lists the physical and dialer interfaces, but no Vi interface, check the Layer 2 configu-\\nration as noted in Figure 15-28. Those could be missing, or there could be mistakes. For instance, something as simple as a mistyped CHAP password ends with this result. (See Example 15-17.)\\nLayer 2: If the show interfaces dialer number command lists an interface status (the first \\nstatus value) of up (spoofing), that is another confirmation that PPPoE is not yet working. If so, check the PPP configuration on the dialer interface, and confirm the username/pass-word matches with what the ISP requires. (See Example 15-18.)\\nLayer 2: To be confident PPPoE is working, look for three items, all seen in Example \\n15-18’s show pppoe session command output:\\n■A status of UP\\n■Three interfaces listed in shorthand: the Ethernet interface (Gi0/1 in the example), thedialer interface (Di2), and the virtual-access interface (Vi1)\\n■The MAC addresses of the two routers; check    the local MAC address with a show\\ninterfaces command on the local router\\nLayer 3: If the show interfaces or show ip interface brief command does not list an IP address for the dialer interface, then look for missing or incorrect Layer 3 commands per Figure 15-28.\\nHere are a couple of possible false positives to avoid as well:\\nDialer interface status: If the show interfaces dialer number command lists a protocol status (the second status value) of up (spoofing), do not be concerned. It will always list that status, both when working and not working. (See Example 15-18.)\\nPhysical interface IP address: The physical Ethernet interface will not have an IP address. \\nIt is used to send Ethernet frames only. So, it is    appropriate with PPPoE to configure the physical Ethernet interface with the no ip address command.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Both topics are interesting both from a technology perspective and from what Cisco has done with these topics on the exams.\\nFirst, for IPv4 ACLs, Chapters 16 and 17 discuss the basics and more advanced features of \\nIPv4 ACLs. ACLs are IPv4 packet filters that can be programmed to look at IPv4 packet headers, make choices, and either allow a packet through or discard the packet. \\nFrom an exam perspective, Cisco has included overlapping exam topics about IPv4 ACLs in \\nboth the ICND1 100-105 and ICND2 200-105 exams. To meet that need, both the ICND1 and ICND2 Official Cert Guides include the same chapters: The contents in this book’s Chapters 16 and 17 are identical (other than the chapter numbers) to the ICND1 book’s Chapters 25 and 26. By using the same book content for these overlapping exam top-ics, those of you who read the ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide can simply review this book’s Chapters 16 and 17, remind yourself of the details, and pick up some speed in your study time.\\nChapter 18, the last chapter in this part, discusses QoS. QoS tools allow the network \\nengineer to direct the routers and switches to change their internal processing details for each packet, resulting in a change to the bandwidth, delay, jitter, and loss characteristics experienced by certain types of packets. QoS is about improving those behaviors for some packets, and managing the unfortunate price paid to worsening those behaviors for other packets.\\nQoS is also an interesting topic from an exam perspective for the current exams. In past \\nCCNA R&S exam blueprints, QoS at most has gotten a minor mention. The current exams’ mentions of QoS represent a big new addition to the content as listed in the CCNA R&S exam topics.\\nptg17396363Part IV\\nIPv4 Services: ACLs and QoS\\nChapter 16:  Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists\\nChapter 17:  Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists \\nChapter 18:  Quality of Service (QoS)\\nPart IV Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 16\\nBasic IPv4 Access Control Lists\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n4.0 Infrastructure Services\\n4.4 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot IPv4 and IPv6 access list for traffic filtering\\n4.1.a Standard\\nIPv4 access control lists (ACL) give network engineers the ability to program a filter into a \\nrouter. Each router, on each interface, for both the inbound and outbound direction, can enable a different ACL with different rules. Each ACL’s rules tell the router which packets to discard, and which to allow through. \\nThis chapter discusses the basics of IPv4 ACLs, and in particular, one type of IP ACL: stan-\\ndard numbered IP ACLs. The next chapter, titled, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists,” completes the discussion by describing other types of IP ACLs.\\nThose of you who have already read the ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide will probably begin to \\nrecognize a lot of similar figures and examples. In fact, this chapter’s content is identical to the ICND1 book’s Chapter 25. Likewise, this book’s Chapter 17 is identical to the ICND1 book’s Chapter 26. I kept the IPv4 ACL content identical in both books in an attempt to make you a little more efficient in your use of time. Here’s why:\\n■ Cisco’s ICND1 and ICND2 ACL exam topics overlap quite a bit, so both books need tocover those topics.\\n■ If this book had some ACL content that was not identical to the ICND1 book, youwould probably want to read it all, in case there was something new.\\n■ With these two chapters, the version in the ICND1 and ICND2 books have the exactsame content, so you can make better use of your time here with ICND2. If you haveread these chapters in the ICND1 book, refer to your notes, skim this chapter as appro-priate, and use the chapter review tools to make sure you have mastered the content.\\nI believe this plan will work better for those of you using both books, and will be of no dif-ference to those of you using only the ICND1 book or only the ICND2 book. Regardless, jump in and read/review about IPv4 ACLs.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

To do so, the ACL configuration lists values that the router can see in the IP, TCP, UDP, and other headers. For example, an ACL can match packets whose source IP address is 1.1.1.1, or packets whose destination IP address is some address in subnet 10.1.1.0/24, or packets with a destination port of TCP port 23 (Telnet).\\nIPv4 ACLs perform many functions in Cisco routers, with the most common use as a packet \\nfilter. Engineers can enable ACLs on a router so that the ACL sits in the forwarding path of packets as they pass through the router. After it is enabled, the router considers whether each IP packet will either be discarded or allowed to continue as if the ACL did not exist.\\nHowever, ACLs can be used for many other IOS features as well. As an example, ACLs can \\nbe used to match packets for applying Quality of Service (QoS) features. QoS allows a rout-er to give some packets better service, and other packets worse service. For example, pack-ets that hold digitized voice need to have very low delay, so ACLs can match voice packets, with QoS logic in turn forwarding voice packets more quickly than data packets.\\nThis first section introduces IP ACLs as used for packet filtering, focusing on these aspects \\nof ACLs: the locations and direction in which to enable ACLs, matching packets by examin-ing headers, and taking action after a packet has been matched .\\nACL Location and Direction\\nCisco    routers can apply ACL logic to packets at the point at which the IP packets enter an interface, or the point at which they exit an interface. In other words, the ACL becomes associated with an interface and for a direction of packet flow (either in or out). That is, the ACL can be applied inbound to the router, before the router makes its forwarding (routing) \\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  441\\ndecision, or outbound, after the router makes its forwarding decision and has determined \\nthe exit interface to use.\\nThe arrows in Figure 16-1 show the locations at which you could filter packets flowing left \\nto right in the topology. For example, imagine that you wanted to allow packets sent by host A to server S1, but to discard packets sent by host B to server S1. Each arrowed line represents a location and direction at which a router could apply an ACL, filtering the pack-ets sent by host B.\\nR1 R2S0/0/0S0/0/1 F0/0\\nF0/1F0/0A\\nB\\nS2S1\\nFigure 16-1 Locations to Filter Packets from Hosts A and B Going Toward Server S1\\nThe    four arrowed lines in the figure point out the location and direction for the router interfaces used to forward the packet from host B to server S1. In this particular example, those interfaces and direction are inbound on R1’s F0/0 interface, outbound on R1’s S0/0/0 interface, inbound on R2’s S0/0/1 interface, and outbound on R2’s F0/0 interface. If, for example, you enabled an ACL on R2’s F0/1 interface, in either direction, that ACL could not possibly filter the packet sent from host B to server S1, because R2’s F0/1 interface is not part of the route from B to S1.\\nIn short, to filter a packet, you must enable an ACL on an interface that processes the pack-\\net, in the same direction the packet flows through that interface.\\nWhen enabled, the router then processes every inbound or outbound IP packet using that \\nACL. For example, if enabled on R1 for packets inbound on interface F0/0, R1 would com-pare every inbound IP packet on F0/0 to the ACL to decide that packet’s fate: to continue unchanged, or to be discarded   .\\nMatching Packets\\nWhen    you think about the location and direction for an ACL, you must already be thinking about what packets you plan to filter (discard), and which ones you want to allow through. To tell the router those same ideas, you must configure the router with an IP ACL that matches packets. Matching packets refers to how to configure the ACL commands to look at each packet, listing how to identify which packets should be discarded, and which should be allowed through.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A, C  2 A, D  3 D  4 E  5 A  6 B\\nptg17396363442  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nEach IP ACL consists of one or more configuration commands, with each command listing \\ndetails about values to look for inside a packet’s headers. Generally, an ACL command uses logic like “look for these values in the packet header, and if found, discard the packet.” (The action could instead be to allow the packet, rather than discard.) Specifically, the ACL looks for header fields you should already know well, including the source and destination IP addresses, plus TCP and UDP port numbers.\\nFor example, consider an example with Figure 16-2, in which you want to allow packets from \\nhost A to server S1, but to discard packets from host B going to that same server. The hosts all now have IP addresses, and the figure shows pseudocode for an ACL on R2. Figure 16-2 also shows the chosen location to enable the ACL: inbound on R2’s S0/0/1 interface.\\nS0/0/010.1.1.1\\n10.1.1.2F0/0\\n1) If S_IP = 10.1.1.1, \\n2) If S_IP = 10.1.1.2,  AllowDiscardS_IP = 10.1.1.1\\nS0/0/1F0/0R1 R2S1A\\nB\\nS_IP = 10.1.1.2\\nFigure 16-2 Pseudocode to Demonstrate ACL Command-Matching Logic\\nFigure 16-2 shows a two-line ACL in a rectangle at the bottom, with simple matching logic: \\nboth statements just look to match the source IP address in the packet. When enabled, R2 looks at every inbound IP packet on that interface and compares each packet to those two ACL commands. Packets sent by host A (source IP address 10.1.1.1) are allowed through, and those sourced by host B (source IP address 10.1.1.2) are discarded   .\\nTaking Action When a Match Occurs\\nWhen using IP ACLs to filter packets, only one of two actions can be chosen. The configu-ration commands use the keywords   deny and   permit, and they mean (respectively) to dis-\\ncard the packet or to allow it to keep going as if the ACL did not exist.\\nThis book focuses on using ACLs to filter packets, but IOS uses ACLs for many more fea-\\ntures. Those features typically use the same matching logic. However, in other cases, the deny or permit keywords imply some other action. \\nTypes of IP ACLs\\nCisco    IOS has supported IP ACLs since the early days of Cisco routers. Beginning with the original standard numbered IP ACLs in the early days of IOS, which could enable the \\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  443\\nlogic shown earlier around Figure 16-2, Cisco has added many ACL features, including \\nthe following:\\n■ Standard numbered ACLs (1–99)\\n■ Extended numbered ACLs (100–199)\\n■ Additional ACL numbers (1300–1999 standard, 2000–2699 extended)\\n■ Named ACLs\\n■ Improved editing with sequence numbers\\nThis chapter focuses solely on standard numbered IP ACLs, while the next chapter discusses the other three primary categories of IP ACLs. Briefly, IP ACLs will be either numbered or named in that the configuration identifies the ACL either using a number or a name. ACLs will also be either standard or extended, with extended ACLs having much more robust abilities in matching packets. Figure 16-3 summarizes the big ideas related to categories of IP ACLs .\\nNumbered:\\n- ID with Number\\n- Global CommandsNamed:- ID with Name- SubcommandsExtended: Matching\\n- Source & Dest.

This section is about a type of Cisco filter ( ACL) that matches only \\nthe source IP address of the packet (standard), is configured to identify the ACL using numbers rather than names (numbered), and looks at IPv4 packets.\\nThis section examines the particulars of standard numbered IP ACLs. First, it examines the \\nidea that one ACL is a list, and what logic that list uses. Following that, the text closely looks at how to match the source IP address field in the packet header, including the syntax of the commands. This section ends with a complete look at the configuration and verifica-tion commands to implement standard ACLs  .\\nptg17396363444  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nList Logic with IP ACLs\\nA single    ACL is both a single entity and, at the same time, a list of one or more configura-\\ntion commands. As a single entity, the configuration enables the entire ACL on an interface, in a specific direction, as shown earlier in Figure 16-1. As a list of commands, each com-mand has different matching logic that the router must apply to each packet when filtering using that ACL.\\nWhen doing ACL processing, the router processes the packet, compared to the ACL, as \\nfollows:\\nACLs use first-match logic. Once a packet matches one line in the ACL, the router takes the action listed in that line of the ACL, and stops looking further in the ACL.\\nTo see exactly what that means, consider the example built around Figure 16-4. The figure shows an example ACL 1 with three lines of pseudocode. This example applies ACL 1 on R2’s S0/0/1 interface, inbound (the same location as in earlier Figure 16-2).\\nS0/0/010.1.1.1\\n10.1.1.2\\n10.3.3.3F0/0\\nACL 1 Pseudocode\\nIf Source = 10.1.1.1 \\nIf Source = 10.1.1.x If Source = 10.x.x.x PermitDenyPermitF0/0S0/0/1\\nF0/1A\\nBR1 R2S1\\nC\\nFigure 16-4 Backdrop for Discussion of List Process with IP ACLs\\nConsider    the first-match ACL logic for a packet sent by host A to server S1. The source IP \\naddress will be 10.1.1.1, and it will be routed so that it enters R2’s S0/0/1 interface, driving R2’s ACL 1 logic. R2 compares this packet to the ACL, matching the first item in the list with a permit action. So this packet should be allowed through, as shown in Figure 16-5, on the left.\\nIf Source = 10.1.1.1 Permit If Source = 10.1.1.1 Permit If Source = 10.1.1.1 Permit\\nExamined and matched\\nExamined and not matchedLegend:If Source = 10.1.1.x Deny\\nIf Source = 10.x.x.x PermitIf Source = 10.1.1.x Deny\\nIf Source = 10.x.x.x PermitIf Source = 10.1.1.x DenyIf Source = 10.x.x.x PermitHost A\\nS_IP Source IP AddressS_IP = 10.1.1.1Host B\\nS_IP = 10.1.1.2Host C\\nS_IP = 10.3.3.3\\nFigure 16-5 ACL Items Compared for Packets from Hosts A, B, and C in Figure 16-4\\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  445\\nNext   , consider a packet sent by host B, source IP address 10.1.1.2. When the packet \\nenters R2’s S0/0/1 interface, R2 compares the packet to ACL 1’s first statement, and does not make a match (10.1.1.1 is not equal to 10.1.1.2). R2 then moves to the second statement, which requires some clarification. The ACL pseudocode, back in Figure 16-4, shows 10.1.1.x, which is meant to be shorthand that any value can exist in the last octet. Comparing only the first three octets, R2 decides that this latest packet does have a source IP address that begins with the first three octets 10.1.1, so R2 considers that to be a match on the second statement. R2 takes the listed action (deny), discarding the packet. R2 also stops ACL processing on the packet, ignoring the third line in the ACL.\\nFinally, consider a packet sent by host C, again to server S1. The packet has source IP \\naddress 10.3.3.3, so when it enters R2’s S0/0/1 interface, and drives ACL processing on R2, R2 looks at the first command in ACL 1. R2 does not match the first ACL command (10.1.1.1 in the command is not equal to the packet’s 10.3.3.3). R2 looks at the second com-mand, compares the first three octets (10.1.1) to the packet source IP address (10.3.3), and still finds no match. R2 then looks at the third command. In this case, the wildcard means ignore the last three octets, and just compare the first octet (10), so the packet matches. R2 then takes the listed action (permit), allowing the packet to keep going.\\nThis sequence of processing an ACL as a list happens for any type of IOS ACL: IP, other \\nprotocols, standard or extended, named or numbered.\\nFinally, if a packet does not match any of the items in the ACL, the packet is discarded. The \\nreason is that every IP ACL has a deny all statement implied at the end of the ACL. It does \\nnot exist in the configuration, but if a router keeps searching the list, and no match is made by the end of the list, IOS considers the packet to have matched an entry that has a deny    action.\\nMatching Logic and Command Syntax\\nStandard    numbered IP ACLs use the following global command:\\naccess-list {1-99 | 1300-1999} {permit | deny} matching-parameters\\nEach standard numbered ACL has one or more   access-list commands with the same num-\\nber, any number from the ranges shown in the preceding line of syntax. (One number is no better than the other.)\\nBesides the ACL number, each access-list command also lists the action (permit or deny), \\nplus the matching logic. The rest of this section examines how to configure the matching parameters, which for standard ACLs, means that you can only match the source IP address, or portions of the source IP address using something called an ACL wildcard     mask.\\nMatching the Exact IP Address\\nTo        match a specific source IP address, the entire IP address, all you have to do is type that IP address at the end of the command. For example, the previous example uses pseudocode for “permit if source = 10.1.1.1.” The following command configures that logic with correct syntax using ACL number 1:\\n  access-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1\\nMatching the exact full IP address is that simple.\\nIn earlier IOS versions, the syntax included a host keyword. Instead of simply typing the \\nfull IP address, you first typed the host keyword, and then the IP address. Note that in later \\nptg17396363446  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIOS versions, if you use the host keyword, IOS accepts the command, but then removes the \\n     keyword.\\naccess-list 1 permit host 10.1.1.1\\nMatching a Subset of the Address with Wildcards\\nOften           , the business goals you want to implement with an ACL do not match a single partic-ular IP address, but rather a range of IP addresses. Maybe you want to match all IP address-es in a subnet. Maybe you want to match all IP addresses in a range of subnets. Regardless, you want to check for more than one IP address in a range of addresses.\\nIOS allows standard ACLs to match a range of addresses using a tool called a wildcard \\nmask. Note that this is not a subnet mask. The wildcard mask (which this book abbreviates \\nas WC mask) gives the engineer a way to tell IOS to ignore parts of the address when mak-\\ning comparisons, essentially treating those parts as wildcards, as if they already matched.\\nYou can think about WC masks in decimal and in binary, and both have their uses. To \\nbegin, think about WC masks in decimal, using these rules:\\nDecimal 0: The router must compare this octet as normal.\\nDecimal 255: The router ignores this octet, considering it to already match.\\nKeeping these two rules in mind, consider Figure 16-6, which demonstrates this logic using \\nthree different but popular WC masks: one that tells the router to ignore the last octet, one that tells the router to ignore the last two octets, and one that tells the router to ignore the last three octets.\\n10. 0 2 1..\\n10. 1 2 1..\\n0. 255 0 0 ..10. 0 0 1..\\n10. 5 4 1..\\n0. 255 255 0 ..10. 0 0 0 ..\\n10. 4 3 2 ..\\n0. 255 255 255 ..\\n255 = Ignore\\nFigure 16-6 Logic for WC Masks 0.0.0.255, 0.0.255.255, and 0.255.255.255\\nAll           three examples in the boxes of Figure 16-6 show two numbers that are clearly different. The WC mask causes IOS to compare only some of the octets, while ignoring other octets. All three examples result in a match, because each wildcard mask tells IOS to ignore some octets. The example on the left shows WC mask 0.0.0.255, which tells the router to treat the last octet as a wildcard, essentially ignoring that octet for the comparison. Similarly, the middle example shows WC mask 0.0.255.255, which tells the router to ignore the two octets on the right. The rightmost case shows WC mask 0.255.255.255, telling the router to ignore the last three octets when comparing values.\\nTo see the WC mask in action, think back to the earlier example related to Figure 16-4 and \\nFigure 16-5. The pseudocode ACL in those two figures used logic that can be created using a WC mask. As a reminder, the logic in the pseudocode ACL in those two figures included the following:\\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  447\\nLine 1: Match and permit all packets with a source address of exactly 10.1.1.1.\\nLine 2: Match and deny all packets with source addresses with first three octets 10.1.1.Line 3: Match and permit all addresses with first single octet 10.\\nFigure 16-7 shows the updated version of Figure 16-4, but with the completed, correct \\nsyntax, including the WC masks. In particular, note the use of WC mask 0.0.0.255 in the second command, telling R2 to ignore the last octet of the number 10.1.1.0, and the WC mask 0.255.255.255 in the third command, telling R2 to ignore the last three octets in the value 10.0.0.0.\\nS0/0/010.1.1.1\\n10.1.1.2\\n10.3.3.3F0/0\\nACL 1\\naccess-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1\\naccess-list 1 deny 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255access-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255F0/1F0/0A\\nBR1 R2S1\\nCS0/0/1\\nFigure 16-7 Syntactically Correct ACL Replaces Pseudocode from Figure 16-4\\nFinally, note that when using a WC mask, the access-list command’s loosely defined source  \\nparameter should be a 0 in any octets where the WC mask is a 255. IOS will specify a source \\naddress to be 0 for the parts that will be ignored, even if nonzero values were           configured.\\nBinary Wildcard Masks\\nWildcard      masks, as dotted-decimal number (DDN) values, actually represent a 32-bit binary number. As a 32-bit number, the WC mask actually directs the router’s logic bit by bit. In short, a WC mask bit of 0 means the comparison should be done as normal, but a binary 1 means that the bit is a wildcard, and can be ignored when comparing the numbers.\\nThankfully, for the purposes of CCENT and CCNA R&S study, and for most real-world \\napplications, you can ignore the binary WC mask. Why? Well, we generally want to match a range of addresses that can be easily identified by a subnet number and mask, whether it be a real subnet, or a summary route that groups subnets together. If you can describe the range of addresses with a subnet number and mask, you can find the numbers to use in your ACL with some simple decimal math, as discussed next     .\\nNOTE If you really want to know the binary mask logic, take the two DDN numbers the ACL will compare (one from the access-list command, and the other from the packet header) and convert both to binary. Then, also convert the WC mask to binary. Compare the first two binary numbers bit by bit, but also ignore any bits for which the WC mask happens to list a binary 1, because that tells you to ignore the bit. If all the bits you checked are equal, it’s a match!\\nptg17396363448  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinding the Right Wildcard Mask to Match a Subnet\\nIn      many cases, an ACL needs to match all hosts in a particular subnet. To match a subnet \\nwith an ACL, you can use the following shortcut:\\n■ Use the subnet number as the source value in the   access-list command.\\n■ Use a wildcard mask found by subtracting the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\\nFor example, for subnet 172.16.8.0 255.255.252.0, use the subnet number (172.16.8.0) as the address parameter, and then do the following math to find the wildcard mask:\\n 255.255.255.255\\n\\x12255.255.252.0\\n 0. 0.  3.255\\nContinuing this example, a completed command for this same subnet would be as follows:\\naccess-list 1 permit 172.16.8.0 0.0.3.255\\nThe upcoming section, “Practice Applying Standard IP ACLs,” gives you a chance to prac-tice matching subnets when configuring      ACLs.\\nMatching Any/All Addresses\\nIn       some cases, you will want one ACL command to match any and all packets that reach that point in the ACL. First, you have to know the (simple) way to match all packets using the     any keyword. More importantly, you need to think about when to match any and all packets.\\nFirst, to match any and all packets with an ACL command, just use the any keyword for the \\naddress. For example, to permit all packets:\\naccess-list 1 permit any\\nSo, when and where should you use such a command? Remember, all Cisco IP ACLs end \\nwith an implicit deny any concept at the end of each ACL. That is, if a router compares a packet to the ACL, and the packet matches none of the configured statements, the router discards the packet. Want to override that default behavior? Configure a   permit any at the \\nend of the ACL.\\nYou might also want to explicitly configure a command to     deny all traffic (for example, \\naccess-list 1 deny any) at the end of an ACL. Why, when the same logic already sits at the end of the ACL anyway? Well, the ACL show commands list counters for the number of \\npackets matched by each command in the ACL, but there is no counter for that implicit deny any concept at the end of the ACL. So, if you want to see counters for how many packets are matched by the deny any logic at the end of the ACL, configure an explicit deny any      .\\nImplementing Standard IP ACLs\\nThis    chapter has already introduced all the configuration steps in bits and pieces. This sec-tion summarizes those pieces as a configuration process. The process also refers to the         access-list command, whose generic syntax is repeated here for reference:\\naccess-list access-list-number {deny | permit} source [source-wildcard]\\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  449\\nStep 1. Plan the location (router and interface) and direction (in or out) on that interface:\\nA. Standard ACLs should be placed near to the destination of the packets so \\nthat they do not unintentionally discard packets that should not be dis-\\ncarded.\\nB. Because standard ACLs can only match a packet’s source IP address, iden-\\ntify the source IP addresses of packets as they go in the direction that the ACL is examining.\\nStep 2. Configure one or more access-list global configuration commands to create the ACL, keeping the following in mind:\\nA. The list is searched sequentially, using first-match logic.\\nB. The default action, if a packet does not match any of the access-list com-\\nmands, is to deny (discard) the packet.\\nStep 3. Enable the ACL on the chosen router interface, in the correct direction, using \\nthe ip access-group number {in | out} interface subcommand        .\\nThe rest of this section shows a couple of examples   .\\nStandard Numbered ACL Example 1\\nThe    first example shows the configuration for the same requirements demonstrated with \\nFigure 16-4 and Figure 16-5. Restated, the requirements for this ACL are as follows:\\n1. Enable the ACL inbound on R2’s S0/0/1 interface.\\n2. Permit packets coming from host A.\\n3. Deny packets coming from other hosts in host A’s subnet.\\n4. Permit packets coming from any other address in Class A network 10.0.0.0.\\n5. The original example made no comment about what to do by default, so simply denyall other traffic.\\nExample 16-1 shows a completed correct configuration, starting with the configuration pro-cess, followed by output from the   show running-config command.\\nExample 16-1 Standard Numbered ACL Example 1 Configuration\\nR2# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

Note that \\nthe access-list command does not change the command prompt from the global configura-\\ntion mode prompt, because the access-list command is a global configuration command. Then, compare that to the output of the show running-config command: the details are identical compared to the commands that were added in configuration mode. Finally, make sure to note the ip access-group 1 in command, under R2’s S0/0/1 interface, which enables the ACL logic (both location and direction).\\nExample 16-2 lists some output from Router R2 that shows information about this ACL. \\nThe   show ip access-lists command lists details about IPv4 ACLs only, while the   show \\naccess-lists command lists details about IPv4 ACLs plus any other types of ACLs that are currently configured, for example, IPv6 ACLs   .\\nExample 16-2 ACL show Commands on R2\\nR2# show ip access-lists\\nStandard IP access list 1    10 permit 10.1.1.1 (107 matches)\\n    20 deny   10.1.1.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255 (4 matches)\\n    30 permit 10.0.0.0, wildcard bits 0.255.255.255 (10 matches)\\nR2# show access-lists\\nStandard IP access list 1\\n    10 permit 10.1.1.1 (107 matches)    20 deny   10.1.1.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255 (4 matches)    30 permit 10.0.0.0, wildcard bits 0.255.255.255 (10 matches)R2# show ip interface s0/0/1\\nSerial0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Internet address is 10.1.2.2/24\\n  Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255\\n  Address determined by setup command\\n  MTU is 1500 bytes  Helper address is not set  Directed broadcast forwarding is disabled  Multicast reserved groups joined: 224.0.0.9\\n  Outgoing access list is not set\\n  Inbound  access list is 1\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nThe output of these commands shows two items of note. The first line of output in this case \\nnotes the type (standard), and the number. If more than one ACL existed, you would see multiple stanzas of output, one per ACL, each with a heading line like this one. Next, these commands list packet counts for the number of packets that the router has matched with each command. For example, 107 packets so far have matched the first line in the    ACL.\\nFinally, the end of the example lists the   show ip interface command output. This command \\nlists, among many other items, the number or name of any IP ACL enabled on the interface \\nper the   ip access-group interface subcommand.\\nStandard Numbered ACL Example 2\\nFor    the second example, use Figure 16-8, and imagine your boss gave you some require-ments hurriedly in the hall. At first, he tells you he wants to filter packets going from the servers on the right toward the clients on the left. Then, he says he wants you to allow \\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  451\\naccess for hosts A, B, and other hosts in their same subnet to server S1, but deny access \\nto that server to the hosts in host C’s subnet. Then, he tells you that, additionally, hosts in host A’s subnet should be denied access to server S2, but hosts in host C’s subnet should be allowed access to server S2—all by filtering packets going right to left only. He then tells you to put the ACL inbound on R2’s F0/0 interface.\\n10.2.2.1\\n10.2.2.2S0/0/0\\nS0/0/110.1.1.1/24\\n10.1.1.2/24F0/0 F0/0A\\nBR1 R2S1\\nS2\\n10.3.3.3F0/1\\nC\\nFigure 16-8 Standard Numbered ACL Example 2\\nIf    you cull through all the boss’s comments, the requirements might reduce to the following:\\n1. Enable the ACL inbound on R2’s F0/0 interface.\\n2. Permit packets from server S1 going to hosts in A’s subnet.\\n3. Deny packets from server S1 going to hosts in C’s subnet.\\n4. Permit packets from server S2 going to hosts in C’s subnet.\\n5. Deny packets from server S2 going to hosts in A’s subnet.\\n6. (There was no comment about what to do by default; use the implied deny all default.)\\nAs it turns out, you cannot do everything your boss asked with a standard ACL. For \\nexample, consider the obvious command for requirement number 2: access-list 2 permit \\n10.2.2.1. That permits all traffic whose source IP is 10.2.2.1 (server S1). The very next requirement asks you to filter (deny) packets sourced from that same IP address! Even if you added another command that checked for source IP address 10.2.2.1, the router would never get to it, because routers use first-match logic when searching the ACL. You cannot check both the destination and source IP address, because standard ACLs cannot check the destination IP address.\\nTo solve this problem, you should get a new boss! No, seriously, you have to rethink the \\nproblem and change the rules. In real life, you would probably use an extended ACL instead, which lets you check both the source and destination IP address.\\nFor the sake of practicing another standard ACL, imagine your boss lets you change the \\nrequirements. First, you will use two outbound ACLs, both on Router R1. Each ACL will permit traffic from a single server to be forwarded onto that connected LAN, with the fol-lowing modified requirements   :\\n1. Using an outbound ACL on R1’s F0/0 interface, permit packets from server S1, and\\ndeny all other packets.\\n2. Using an outbound ACL on R1’s F0/1 interface, permit packets from server S2, and\\ndeny all other packets.\\nptg17396363452  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 16-3 shows the configuration that completes these requirements.\\nExample 16-3 Alternative Configuration in Router R1\\naccess-list 2 remark This ACL permits server S1 traffic to host A\\'s subnet\\naccess-list 2 permit 10.2.2.1\\n!\\naccess-list 3 remark This ACL permits server S2 traffic to host C\\'s subnet\\naccess-list 3 permit 10.2.2.2!\\ninterface F0/0\\n ip access-group 2 out\\n!interface F0/1\\n ip access-group 3 out\\nAs highlighted in the example, the solution with ACL number 2 permits all traffic from serv-\\ner S1, with that logic enabled for packets exiting R1’s F0/0 interface. All other traffic will be discarded because of the implied deny all at the end of the ACL. In addition, ACL 3 permits traffic from server S2, which is then permitted to exit R1’s F0/1 interface. Also, note that the solution shows the use of the access-list remark parameter, which allows you to leave text documentation that stays with the    ACL.\\nNOTE When routers apply an ACL to filter packets in the outbound direction, as shown in Example 16-3, the router checks packets that it routes against the ACL. However, a router does not filter packets that the router itself creates with an outbound ACL. Examples of those packets include routing protocol messages, and packets sent by the ping and \\ntraceroute commands on that router.\\nTroubleshooting and Verification Tips\\nTroubleshooting       IPv4 ACLs requires some attention to detail. In particular, you have to be ready to look at the address and wildcard mask and confidently predict the addresses matched by those two combined parameters. The upcoming practice problems a little later in this chapter can help prepare you for that part of the work. But a few other tips can help you verify and troubleshoot ACL problems on the exams as well.\\nFirst, you can tell if the router is matching packets or not with a couple of tools. Example \\n16-2 already showed that IOS keeps statistics about the packets matched by each line of an ACL. In addition, if you add the log keyword to the end of an     access-list command, IOS \\nthen issues log messages with occasional statistics about matches of that particular line of the ACL. Both the statistics and the log messages can be helpful in deciding which line in the ACL is being matched by a packet.\\nFor example, Example 16-4 shows an updated version of ACL 2 from Example 16-3, this \\ntime with the log keyword added. The bottom of the example then shows a typical log mes-sage, this one showing the resulting match based on a packet with source IP address 10.2.2.1 (as matched with the ACL), to destination address 10.1.1.1      .\\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  453\\nExample 16-4 Creating Log Messages for ACL Statistics\\nR1# show running-config\\n! lines removed for brevity\\naccess-list 2 remark This ACL permits server S1 traffic to host A\\'s subnet\\naccess-list 2 permit 10.2.2.1 log\\n!interface F0/0\\n ip access-group 2 out\\nR1#\\nFeb  4 18:30:24.082: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGNP: list 2 permitted 0 10.2.2.1 -> 10.1.1.1, 1 \\n  packet\\nAnytime you troubleshoot an ACL for the first time, before getting into the details of \\nthe matching logic, take the time to think about both the interface on which the ACL is enabled, and the direction of packet flow. Sometimes, the matching logic is perfect—but the ACL has been enabled on the wrong interface, or for the wrong direction, to match the packets as configured for the ACL.\\nFor example, Figure 16-9 repeats the same ACL shown earlier in Figure 16-7. The first line \\nof that ACL matches the specific host address 10.1.1.1. If that ACL exists on Router R2, placing that ACL as an inbound ACL on R2’s S0/0/1 interface can work, because pack-ets sent by host 10.1.1.1—on the left side of the figure—can enter R2’s S0/0/1 interface. However, if R2 enables ACL 1 on its F0/0 interface, for inbound packets, the ACL will never match a packet with source IP address 10.1.1.1, because packets sent by host 10.1.1.1 will never enter that interface. Packets sent by 10.1.1.1 will exit R2’s F0/0 interface, but never enter it, just because of the network topology      .\\nS0/0/010.1.1.1\\n10.1.1.2\\n10.3.3.3F0/0ACL 1\\naccess-list 1 permit 10.1.1.1\\naccess-list 1 deny 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255\\naccess-list 1 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255\\nF0/1F0/0A\\nBR1 R2S1\\nCS0/0/1\\nCan Match\\n10.1.1.1Cannot Match\\n10.1.1.1\\nFigure 16-9 Example of Checking the Interface and Direction for an ACL\\nPractice Applying Standard IP ACLs\\nSome CCENT and CCNA R&S topics, like ACLs, simply require more drills and practice \\nthan others. ACLs require you to think of parameters to match ranges of numbers, and that of course requires some use of math, and some use of processes.\\nThis section provides some practice problems and tips, from two perspectives. First, this sec-\\ntion asks you to build one-line standard ACLs to match some packets. Second, this section \\nptg17396363454  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nasks you to interpret existing ACL commands to describe what packets the ACL will match. \\nBoth skills are useful for the exams.\\nPractice Building access-list Commands\\nIn this     section, practice getting comfortable with the syntax of the access-list command, \\nparticularly with choosing the correct matching logic. These skills will be helpful when read-ing about extended and named ACLs in the next chapter.\\nFirst, the following list summarizes some important tips to consider when choosing match-\\ning parameters to any access-list command:\\n■ To match a specific address, just list the address.\\n■ To match any and all addresses, use the any keyword.\\n■ To match based only on the first one, two, or three octets of an address, use the0.255.255.255, 0.0.255.255, and 0.0.0.255 WC masks, respectively. Also, make thesource (address) parameter have 0s in the wildcard octets (those octets with 255 in thewildcard mask).\\n■ To match a subnet, use the subnet ID as the source, and find the WC mask by subtract-ing the DDN subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\\nTable 16-2 lists the criteria for several practice problems. Your job: Create a one-line stan-dard ACL that matches the packets. The answers are listed in the section “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems,” later in this     chapter.\\nTable 16-2 Building One-Line Standard ACLs: Practice\\nProblem Criteria\\n1 Packets from 172.16.5.4\\n2 Packets from hosts with 192.168.6 as the first three octets\\n3 Packets from hosts with 192.168 as the first two octets\\n4 Packets from any host\\n5 Packets from subnet 10.1.200.0/21\\n6 Packets from subnet 10.1.200.0/27\\n7 Packets from subnet 172.20.112.0/23\\n8 Packets from subnet 172.20.112.0/26\\n9 Packets from subnet 192.168.9.64/28\\n10 Packets     from subnet 192.168.9.64/30\\nReverse Engineering from ACL to Address Range\\nIn some      cases, you may not be creating your own ACL. Instead, you may need to interpret \\nsome existing access-list commands. To answer these types of questions on the exams, you need to determine the range of IP addresses matched by a particular address/wildcard mask combination in each ACL statement.\\nUnder certain assumptions that are reasonable for CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications, \\ncalculating the range of addresses matched by an ACL can be relatively simple. Basically, the range of addresses begins with the address configured in the ACL command. The range of addresses ends with the sum of the address field and the wildcard mask. That’s it.\\nptg1739636316Chapter 16: Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists  455\\nFor example, with the command access-list 1 permit 172.16.200.0 0.0.7.255, the low end \\nof the range is simply 172.16.200.0, taken directly from the command itself. Then, to find the high end of the range, just add this number to the WC mask, as follows:\\n172.16.200.0\\n+ 0. 0. 7.255\\n172.16.207.255 \\nFor this last bit of practice, look at the existing access-list commands in Table 16-3. In each case, make a notation about the exact IP address, or range of IP addresses, matched by the command.\\nTable 16-3 Finding IP Addresses/Ranges Matching by Existing ACLs\\nProblem Commands for Which to Predict the Source Address Range\\n1 access-list 1 permit 10.7 .6.5\\n2 access-list 2 permit 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.127 \\n3 access-list 3 permit 192.168.6.0 0.0.0.31\\n4 access-list 4 permit 172.30.96.0 0.0.3.255\\n5 access-list 5 permit 172.30.96.0 0.0.0.63\\n6 access-list 6 permit 10.1.192.0 0.0.0.31\\n7 access-list 7 permit 10.1.192.0 0.0.1.255\\n8 access-list 8 permit 10.1.192.0 0.0.63.255\\nInterestingly     , IOS lets the CLI user type an access-list command in configuration mode, \\nand IOS will potentially change the address parameter before placing the command into the running-config file. This process of just finding the range of addresses matched by the access-list command expects that the access-list command came from the router, so that any such changes were complete.\\nThe change IOS can make with an access-list command is to convert to 0 any octet of an \\naddress for which the wildcard mask’s octet is 255. For example, with a wildcard mask of \\n0.0.255.255, IOS ignores the last two octets. IOS expects the address field to end with two 0s. If not, IOS still accepts the access-list command, but IOS changes the last two octets of the address to 0s. Example 16-5 shows an example, where the configuration shows address 10.1.1.1, but wildcard mask 0.0.255.255.\\nExample 16-5 IOS Changing the Address Field in an access-list Command\\nR2# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nR2(config)# access-list 21 permit 10.1.1.1 0.0.255.255\\nR2(config)# ^Z\\nR2#R2# show ip access-lists\\nStandard IP access list 21\\n    10 permit 10.1.0.0, wildcard bits 0.0.255.255\\nptg17396363456  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe math to find the range of addresses relies on the fact that either the command is fully \\ncorrect, or that IOS has already set these address octets to 0, as shown in the      example.\\nNOTE The most useful WC masks, in binary, do not interleave 0s and 1s. This book assumes the use of only these types of WC masks. However, Cisco IOS allows WC masks that interleave 0s and 1s, but using these WC masks breaks the simple method of calculating the range of addresses. As you progress through to CCIE studies, be ready to dig deeper to learn how to determine what an ACL matches.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Just like standard IP ACLs, you enable extended access lists on interfaces for packets either entering or exiting the interface. IOS searches the list sequentially. Extended ACLs also use first-match logic, because the router stops the search through the list as soon as the first statement is matched, taking the action defined in the first-matched statement. All these features are also true of standard numbered access lists (and named ACLs).\\nExtended ACLs differ from standard ACLs mostly because of the larger variety of packet \\nheader fields that can be used to match a packet. One extended ACL statement can examine multiple parts of the packet headers, requiring that all the parameters be matched correctly to match that one ACL statement. That powerful matching logic makes extended access lists both more useful and more complex than standard IP ACLs  .\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  463\\nMatching the Protocol, Source IP, and Destination IP\\nLike       standard numbered IP ACLs, extended numbered IP ACLs also use the   access-list \\nglobal command. The syntax is identical, at least up through the permit or deny keyword. \\nAt that point, the command lists matching parameters, and those differ, of course. In par-\\nticular, the extended ACL access-list command requires three matching parameters: the IP protocol type, the source IP address, and the destination IP address.\\nThe IP header’s Protocol field identifies the header that follows the IP header. Figure 17-2 \\nshows the location of the IP Protocol field, the concept of it pointing to the type of header that follows, along with some details of the IP header for reference.\\nIdentifies Next HeaderIP Header Next Header\\nMiscellaneous\\nHeader\\nFieldsProtocol\\nTypeHeader\\nChecksumSource IP\\nAddressDestination\\nIP AddressOptions9 1 2 44 Variable\\nTCP, UDP\\nICMP,\\nEIGRP, IGMP,…\\nFigure 17-2 IP Header, with Focus on Required Fields in Extended IP ACLs\\nIOS       requires that you configure parameters for the three highlighted parts of Figure 17-2. For the protocol type, you simply use a keyword, such as tcp, udp, or icmp, matching IP \\npackets that happen to have a TCP, UDP, or ICMP header, respectively, following the IP header. Or you can use the keyword ip, which means “all IPv4 packets.” You also must con-figure some values for the source and destination IP address fields that follow; these fields use the same syntax and options for matching the IP addresses as discussed in Chapter 16, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists.” Figure 17-3 shows the syntax.\\nKeyword Address & Wildcard\\n100 -   199\\n2000 - 2699 Matching\\nOptionsaccess-list 101 permit source_IP protocol dest_IP\\nip\\ntcpudpicmpothers...\\nFigure 17-3 Extended ACL Syntax, with Required Fields\\nNOTE When matching IP addresses in the source and destination fields, there is one \\ndifference with standard ACLs: When matching a specific IP address, the extended ACL requires the use of the host keyword. You cannot simply list the IP address alone.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 E, F  2 A, E  3 E  4 A, C  5 B, C  6 C, D\\nptg17396363464  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 17-2 lists several sample   access-list commands that use only the required matching \\nparameters. Feel free to cover the right side and use the table for an exercise, or just review the explanations to       get an idea for the logic in some sample commands.\\nTable 17-2 Extended access-list Commands and Logic Explanations\\naccess-list Statement What It Matches\\naccess-list 101 deny tcp any any Any IP packet that has a TCP header\\naccess-list 101 deny udp any any Any IP packet that has a UDP header\\naccess-list 101 deny icmp any any Any IP packet that has an ICMP header\\naccess-list 101 deny ip host \\n1.1.1.1 host 2.2.2.2All IP packets from host 1.1.1.1 going to host 2.2.2.2, regardless of the header after the IP header\\naccess-list 101 deny udp 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 anyAll IP packets that have a UDP header following the IP header, from subnet 1.1.1.0/24, and going to any destination\\nThe last entry in Table 17-2 helps make an important point about how IOS processes \\nextended ACLs  :\\nIn an extended ACL access-list command, all the matching parameters must match the packet for the packet to match the command.\\nFor example, in that last example from Table 17-2, the command checks for UDP, a source IP address from subnet 1.1.1.0/24, and any destination IP address. If a packet with source IP address 1.1.1.1 were examined, it would match the source IP address check, but if it had a TCP header instead of UDP, it would not match this access-list command. All parameters \\n        must match.\\nMatching TCP and UDP Port Numbers\\nExtended       ACLs can also examine parts of the TCP and UDP headers, particularly the source and destination port number fields. The port numbers identify the application that sends or receives the data.\\nThe most useful ports to check are the well-known ports used by servers. For example, web \\nservers use well-known port 80 by default. Figure 17-4 shows the location of the port num-bers in the TCP header, following the IP       header.\\nIP Header TCP Header\\nMiscellaneous\\nHeader\\nFieldsProtocol\\n6 (TCP)Header\\nChecksumSource IP\\nAddressDestination IP\\nAddressOptionsSource\\nPortDest.\\nPortRest\\nof\\nTCP9 1 2 4 4 Variable 2 2 16+\\n6 = TCP\\nFigure 17-4 IP Header, Followed by a TCP Header and Port Number Fields\\nWhen an extended ACL command     includes either the tcp or     udp keyword, that command can optionally reference the source and/or destination port. To make these comparisons, the syntax uses keywords for equal, not equal, less than, greater than, and for a range of port numbers. In addition, the command can use either the literal decimal port numbers, or \\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  465\\nmore convenient keywords for some well-known application ports. Figure 17-5 shows the \\npositions of the source and destination port fields in the access-list command and these port number       keywords.\\naccess-list 101 permit source_IP dest_IP protocolMatching\\nsource_port dest_port\\ntcp\\nudpeq __ne __lt __gt __range __eq __ne __lt __gt __range __\\neq: lt: = < range: x to y ne: gt: >ʒ Legend:\\nFigure 17-5 Extended ACL Syntax with TCP and UDP Port Numbers Enabled\\nFor       example, consider the simple network shown in Figure 17-6. The FTP server sits on the \\nright, with the client on the left. The figure shows the syntax of an ACL that matches the following:\\n■ Packets that include a TCP header\\n■ Packets sent from the client subnet\\n■ Packets sent to the server subnet\\n■ Packets with TCP destination port 21 (FTP server control port)\\nSource 172.16.1.1 Destination 172.16.3.1 Source Port > 1023 Destination Port 21\\naccess-list 101 permit tcp  172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255  172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255  eq 21OUT\\nOUT172.16.1.0/24 172.16.3.0/24\\n172.16.3.1\\nS0/0\\nS0/1 Fa0/0IN\\nR1 R2Fa0/0IN\\nSource IP Destination Port Destination IPPort 21PC1\\nFigure 17-6 Filtering Packets Based on Destination Port\\nTo       fully appreciate the matching of the destination port with the  eq 21 parameters, con-\\nsider packets moving from left to right, from PC1 to the server. Assuming the server uses well-known port 21 (FTP control port), the packet’s TCP header has a destination port value of 21. The ACL syntax includes the eq 21 parameters after the destination IP address. The position after the destination address parameters is important: That position identifies the fact that the eq 21 parameters should be compared to the packet’s destination port. As a result, the ACL statement shown in Figure 17-6 would match this packet, and the destina-tion port of 21, if used in any of the four locations implied by the four dashed arrowed lines in the figure.\\nptg17396363466  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nConversely, Figure 17-7 shows the reverse flow, with a packet sent by the server back \\ntoward PC1. In this case, the packet’s TCP header has a source port of 21, so the ACL must check the source port value of 21, and the ACL must be located on different interfaces. In this case, the eq 21 parameters follow the source address field, but come before the desti-nation address       field.\\naccess-list 101 permit  tcp  172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255  eq 21  172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255Source 172.16.3.1 Destination 172.16.1.1 Source Port 21 Destination Port > 1023\\nR1 R2172.16.1.0/24 172.16.3.0/24\\n172.16.3.1\\nSource Address\\nSource PortDestination AddressPort 21PC1IN\\nS0/0 Fa0/0OUT\\nIN\\nS0/1 Fa0/0OUT\\nFigure 17-7 Filtering Packets Based on Source Port\\nWhen       examining ACLs that match port numbers, first consider the location and direction in which the ACL will be applied. That direction determines whether the packet is being sent to the server, or from the server. At that point, you can decide whether you need to check the source or destination port in the packet. For reference, Table 17-3 lists many of the popular port numbers and their transport layer protocols and applications. Note that the syntax of the   access-list commands accepts both the port numbers and a shorthand version \\nof the application       name.\\nTable 17-3 Popular Applications and Their Well-Known Port Numbers\\nPort Number(s) Protocol Application access-list Command Keyword\\n20 TCP FTP data ftp-data\\n21 TCP FTP control ftp\\n22 TCP SSH —\\n23 TCP Telnet telnet\\n25 TCP SMTP smtp\\n53 UDP , TCP DNS domain\\n67 UDP DHCP Server bootps\\n68 UDP DHCP Client bootpc\\n69 UDP TFTP tftp\\n80 TCP HTTP (WWW) www\\n110 TCP POP3 pop3\\n161 UDP SNMP snmp\\n443 TCP SSL —\\n514 UDP Syslog —\\n16,384 – 32,767 UDP RTP (voice, video) —\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  467\\nTable 17-4 lists several example access-list commands that match based on port numbers. \\nCover the right side of the table, and try to characterize the packets matched by each com-mand.

However, the two commands in Table 17-5 summarize the syntax options as covered in this book. \\nTable 17-5 Extended IP   Access List Configuration Commands\\nCommand Configuration Mode and \\nDescription\\naccess-list access-list-number {deny | permit} protocol \\nsource source-wildcard destination destination-wildcard  \\n[log | log-input]Global command for extended numbered access lists.

You must choose the location and direction in which to enable the ACL, particularly the direction, so that you can characterize whether certain addresses and ports will be either the source or destination. Configure the ACL using access-list commands, \\nand when complete, then enable the ACL using the same   ip access-group command used \\nwith standard ACLs. All these steps mirror what you do with standard ACLs; however, when configuring, keep the following differences in mind   :\\n■ Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packets that will be fil-tered. Filtering close to the source of the packets saves some bandwidth.\\nptg17396363468  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n■ Remember that all fields in one access-list command must match a packet for the packet\\nto be considered to match that access-list statement.\\n■ Use numbers of 100–199 and 2000–2699 on the access-list commands; no one numberis inherently better than another.\\nExtended IP Access Lists: Example 1\\nThis    example focuses on understanding basic syntax. In this case, the ACL denies Bob access to all FTP servers on R1’s Ethernet, and it denies Larry access to server1’s web server. Figure 17-8 shows the network topology; Example 17-1 shows the configuration on R1.\\nServer1\\n172.16.1.100\\nServer2\\n172.16.1.102\\nJimmy JerryLarry\\nBob172.16.2.10\\n172.16.3.10\\n172.16.3.8 172.16.3.9E0\\nE0E0S0\\nS0S1S1\\nS1S0\\nSW1SW2\\nSW3SW12\\nSW13R1R2\\nR3\\nFigure 17-8 Network Diagram for Extended Access List Example 1\\nExample 17-1 R1’s Extended Access    List: Example 1\\ninterface Serial0\\n ip address 172.16.12.1 255.255.255.0\\n ip access-group 101 in\\n!\\ninterface Serial1 ip address 172.16.13.1 255.255.255.0\\n ip access-group 101 in\\n!\\naccess-list 101 remark Stop Bob to FTP servers, and Larry to Server1 webaccess-list 101 deny tcp host 172.16.3.10 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp\\naccess-list 101 deny tcp host 172.16.2.10 host 172.16.1.100 eq www\\naccess-list 101 permit ip any any\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  469\\nThe first ACL statement prevents Bob’s access to FTP servers in subnet 172.16.1.0. The \\nsecond statement prevents Larry’s access to web services on Server1. The final statement permits all other traffic.\\nFocusing on the syntax for a moment, there are several new items to review. First, the \\naccess-list number for extended access lists falls in the range of 100 to 199 or 2000 to 2699. Following the permit or deny action, the protocol parameter defines whether you want to check for all IP packets or specific headers, such as TCP or UDP headers. When you check for TCP or UDP port numbers, you must specify the TCP or UDP protocol. Both FTP and the web use TCP.\\nThis    example uses the eq parameter, meaning “equals,” to check the destination port num-\\nbers for FTP control (keyword ftp) and HTTP traffic (keyword www). You can use the \\nnumeric values—or, for the more popular options, a more obvious text version is valid. (If you were to type eq 80, the config would show eq www.)\\nThis example enables the ACL in two places on R1: inbound on each serial interface. These locations achieve the goal of the ACL. However, that initial placement was made to make the point that Cisco suggests that you locate them as close as possible to the source of the packet. Therefore, Example 17-2 achieves the same goal as Example 17-1 of stopping Bob’s access to FTP servers at the main site, and it does so with an ACL on R3.\\nExample 17-2 R3’s Extended Access List Stopping Bob from Reaching FTP Servers \\nNear R1\\ninterface Ethernet0\\n ip address 172.16.3.1 255.255.255.0\\n ip access-group 103 in\\naccess-list 103 remark deny Bob to FTP servers in subnet 172.16.1.0/24\\naccess-list 103 deny tcp host 172.16.3.10 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq ftp\\naccess-list 103 permit ip any any\\nThe new configuration on R3 meets the goals to filter Bob’s traffic, while also meeting the \\noverarching design goal of keeping the ACL close to the source of the packets. ACL 103 on R3 looks a lot like ACL 101 on R1 from Example 17-1, but this time, the ACL does not bother to check for the criteria to match Larry’s traffic, because Larry’s traffic will never enter R3’s Ethernet 0 interface. ACL 103 filters Bob’s FTP traffic to destinations in subnet 172.16.1.0/24, with all other traffic entering R3’s E0 interface making it into the    network.\\nExtended IP Access Lists: Example 2\\nExample    17-3, based on the network shown in Figure 17-9, shows another example of how to use extended IP access lists. This example uses the following criteria:\\n■ Sam is not allowed access to the subnet of Bugs or Daffy.\\n■ Hosts on the Seville Ethernet are not allowed access to hosts on the Yosemite Ethernet.\\n■ All other combinations are allowed.\\nptg17396363470  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ns1\\ns1s1s0 s0s0\\nSubnet 10.1.129.0\\nElmer\\n10.1.3.1Red\\n10.1.3.2Seville\\nE0\\nSubnet 10.1.3.0\\nSam\\n10.1.2.1Emma\\n10.1.2.2Yosemite\\nE0\\nSubnet 10.1.2.0AlbuquerqueE0Subnet 10.1.1.0Bugs\\n10.1.1.1Daffy\\n10.1.1.2\\nSubnet 10.1.128.0 Subnet 10.1.130.0\\nFigure 17-9 Network Diagram for Extended Access List Example 2\\nExample 17-3 Yosemite    Configuration for Extended Access List Example\\ninterface ethernet 0\\n ip access-group 110 in\\n!\\naccess-list 110 deny ip host 10.1.2.1 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255\\naccess-list 110 deny ip 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.3.0 0.0.0.255access-list 110 permit ip any any\\nThis configuration solves the problem with few statements while keeping to the Cisco \\ndesign guideline of placing extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the traffic. The ACL filters packets that enter Yosemite’s E0 interface, which is the first router interface that packets sent by Sam enter. If the route between Yosemite and the other subnets chang-es over time, the ACL still applies. Also, the filtering mandated by the second requirement (to disallow Seville’s LAN hosts from accessing Yosemite’s) is met by the second access-list statement. Stopping packet flow from Yosemite’s LAN subnet to Seville’s LAN subnet stops effective communication between the two subnets. Alternatively, the opposite logic could have been configured at    Seville.\\nPractice Building access-list Commands\\nTable 17-6 supplies a practice exercise to help you get comfortable with the syntax of the extended access-list command, particularly with choosing the correct matching logic. Your \\njob: create a one-line extended ACL that matches the packets. The answers are in the sec-tion “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems,” later in this chapter. Note that if the criteria mentions a particular application protocol, for example, “web client,” that means to specifi-cally match for that application protocol.\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  471\\nTable 17-6 Building One-Line Extended ACLs: Practice\\nProblem Criteria\\n1 From web client 10.1.1.1, sent to a web server in subnet 10.1.2.0/24.\\n2 From Telnet client 172.16.4.3/25, sent to a Telnet server in subnet 172.16.3.0/25. \\nMatch all hosts in the client’s subnet as well.\\n3 ICMP messages from the subnet in which 192.168.7 .200/26 resides to all hosts in \\nthe subnet where 192.168.7 .14/29 resides.\\n4 From web server 10.2.3.4/23’s subnet to clients in the same subnet as host \\n10.4.5.6/22.\\n5 From Telnet server 172.20.1.0/24’s subnet, sent to any host in the same subnet as \\nhost 172.20.44.1/23.\\n6 From web client 192.168.99.99/28, sent to a web server in subnet 192.168.176.0/28. \\nMatch all hosts in the client’s subnet as well.\\n7 ICMP messages from the subnet in which 10.55.66.77/25 resides to all hosts in the \\nsubnet where 10.66.55.44/26 resides.\\n8 Any and every IPv4 packet.\\nNamed ACLs and ACL Editing\\nNow that   you have a good understanding of the core concepts in IOS IP ACLs, this section \\nexamines a few enhancements to IOS support for ACLs: named ACLs and ACL editing with sequence numbers. Although both features are useful and important, neither adds any func-tion as to what a router can and cannot filter. Instead, named ACLs and ACL sequence num-bers make it easier to remember ACL names and edit existing ACLs when an ACL needs to change.\\nNamed IP Access Lists\\nNamed   IP ACLs have many similarities with numbered IP ACLs. They can be used for filter-ing packets, plus for many other purposes. They can match the same fields as well: Standard numbered ACLs can match the same fields as a standard named ACL, and extended num-bered ACLs can match the same fields as an extended named ACL.\\nOf course, there are differences between named and numbered ACLs. Named ACLs origi-\\nnally had three big differences compared to numbered ACLs:\\n■ Using names instead of numbers to identify the ACL, making it easier to remember thereason for the ACL\\n■ Using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matchingparameters\\n■ Using ACL editing features that allow the CLI user to delete individual lines from theACL and insert new lines\\nYou can easily learn named ACL configuration by just converting numbered ACLs to use the equivalent named ACL configuration. Figure 17-10 shows just such a conversion, using a simple three-line standard ACL number 1. To create the three   permit subcommands for the named ACL, you literally copy parts of the three numbered ACL commands, beginning with the permit keyword  .\\nptg17396363472  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\naccess-list 1  permit 1.1.1.1\\naccess-list 1  permit 3.3.3.3access-list 1  permit 2.2.2.2permit 1.1.1.1\\npermit 3.3.3.3permit 2.2.2.2Numbered ACL Named ACL\\nip access-list standard name\\nFigure 17-10 Named ACL Versus Numbered ACL Configuration\\nThe only truly new part of the named ACL configuration is the   ip access-list global con-\\nfiguration command. This command defines whether an ACL is a standard or extended \\nACL, and defines the name. It also moves the user to ACL configuration mode, as shown in upcoming Example 17-4. Once in ACL configuration mode, you configure   permit,   deny, \\nand   remark commands that mirror the syntax of numbered ACL access-list commands. If you’re configuring a standard named ACL, these commands match the syntax of standard numbered ACLs; if you’re configuring extended named ACLs, they match the syntax of extended numbered ACLs.\\nExample 17-4 shows the configuration of a named extended ACL. Pay particular attention \\nto the configuration mode prompts, which show ACL configuration   mode.\\nExample 17-4 Named Access    List Configuration\\nRouter# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The   ip access-list extended \\nbarney command creates the ACL, naming it barney and placing the user in ACL configura-\\ntion mode. This command also tells the IOS that barney is an extended ACL. Next, five dif-ferent permit and deny statements define the matching logic and action to be taken upon a \\nmatch. The   show running-config command output lists the named ACL configuration before \\nthe single entry is deleted.\\nNamed ACLs    allow the user to delete and add new lines to the ACL from within ACL con-\\nfiguration mode. Example 17-5 shows how, with the no deny ip . . . command deleting a single entry from the ACL. Notice that the output of the   show access-list command at the \\nend of the example still lists the ACL, with four permit and deny commands instead of five.\\nExample 17-5 Removing One Command from a Named ACL\\nRouter# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

For example, to simply delete a line from the ACL, the user had to delete the entire ACL and then reconfigure it.\\nThe ACL editing feature uses an ACL sequence number that is added to each ACL permit or \\ndeny statement, with the numbers representing the sequence of statements in the ACL. ACL \\nsequence numbers provide the following features for both numbered and named ACLs:\\nNew configuration style for numbered: Numbered ACLs use a configuration style like named ACLs, as well as the traditional style, for the same ACL; the new style is required to perform advanced ACL editing.\\nDeleting single lines: An individual ACL permit or deny statement can be deleted with a \\nno sequence-number subcommand.\\nInserting new lines: Newly added   permit and   deny commands can be configured with \\na sequence number before the deny or permit command, dictating the location of the \\nstatement within the ACL.\\nAutomatic sequence numbering: IOS adds sequence numbers to commands as you con-\\nfigure them, even if you do not include the sequence numbers.\\nptg17396363474  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo take    advantage of the ability to delete and insert lines in an ACL, both numbered and \\nnamed ACLs must use the same overall configuration style and commands used for named ACLs. The only difference in syntax is whether a name or number is used. Example 17-6 shows the configuration of a standard numbered IP ACL, using this alternative configura-tion style. The example shows the power of the ACL sequence number for editing. In this example, the following occurs  :\\nStep 1. Numbered ACL 24 is configured using this new-style configuration, with three   permit commands.\\nStep 2. The   show ip access-lists command shows the three permit commands with sequence numbers 10, 20, and 30.\\nStep 3. The engineer deletes only the second permit command using the no 20 ACL \\nsubcommand, which simply refers to sequence number 20.\\nStep 4. The   show ip access-lists command confirms that the ACL now has only two lines (sequence numbers 10 and 30).\\nStep 5. The engineer adds a new   deny command to the beginning of the ACL, using \\nthe 5 deny 10.1.1.1 ACL subcommand.\\nStep 6. The   show ip access-lists command again confirms the changes, this time listing \\nthree commands, sequence numbers      5, 10, and 30.\\nNOTE For this example, note that the user does not leave configuration mode, instead \\nusing the do command to tell IOS to issue the   show ip access-lists EXEC command from \\nconfiguration mode.\\nExample 17-6 Editing ACLs      Using Sequence Numbers\\n!

First, IOS supports the traditional method, using the access-list global commands shown earlier in Examples 17-1, 17-2, and 17-3. IOS also supports the numbered ACL configuration with commands just like named ACLs, as shown in Example 17-6.\\nOddly, IOS always stores numbered ACLs with the original style of configuration, as global \\naccess-list commands, no matter which method is used to configure the ACL. Example 17-7 demonstrates these facts, picking up where Example 17-6 ended, with the following addi-tional steps:\\nStep 7. The engineer lists the configuration (  show running-config), which lists the old-\\nstyle configuration commands—even though the ACL was created with the new-style commands.\\nStep 8. The engineer adds a new statement to the end of the ACL using the old-style access-list 24 permit 10.1.4.0 0.0.0.255 global configuration command.\\nStep 9. The   show ip access-lists command confirms that the old-style access-list com-mand from the previous step followed the rule of being added only to the end of the ACL.\\nStep 10. The engineer displays the configuration to confirm that the parts of ACL 24 \\nconfigured with both new-style commands and old-style commands are all listed in the same old-style ACL (show running-config)   .\\nExample 17-7 Adding to and Displaying a Numbered ACL Configuration\\n!

To help, Cisco makes the following general recommendations in the courses on which the CCNA R&S exams are based:\\n■ Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packet. This strategyallows ACLs to discard the packets early.\\n■ Place standard ACLs as close as possible to the destination of the packet. This strategyavoids the mistake with standard ACLs (which match the source IPv4 address only) ofunintentionally discarding packets that did not need to be discarded.\\n■ Place more specific statements early in the ACL.\\n■ Disable an ACL from its interface (using the   no ip access-group interface subcommand)\\nbefore making changes to the ACL.\\nThe first point deals with the concept of where to locate your ACLs. If you intend to filter a packet, filtering closer to the packet’s source means that the packet takes up less band-width in the network, which seems to be more efficient—and it is. Therefore, Cisco sug-gests locating extended ACLs as close to the source as possible.\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  477\\nHowever, the second point seems to contradict the first point, at least for standard ACLs, \\nto locate them close to the destination. Why? Well, because standard ACLs look only at the source IP address, they tend to filter more than you want filtered when placed close to the source. For example, imagine that Fred and Barney are separated by four routers. If you filter Barney’s traffic sent to Fred on the first router, Barney can’t reach any hosts near the other three routers. So, the Cisco courses make a blanket recommendation to locate stan-dard ACLs closer to the destination to avoid filtering traffic  you do not mean to filter.\\nFor the third item in the list, by placing more specific matching parameters early in each \\nlist, you are less likely to make mistakes in the ACL. For example, imagine that the ACL first listed a command that permitted traffic going to 10.1.1.0/24, and the second command denied traffic going to host 10.1.1.1. Packets sent to host 10.1.1.1 would match the first command, and never match the more specific second command. Note that later IOS ver-sions prevent this mistake during configuration in some cases, as shown later in this chapter in Example 17-11.\\nFinally, Cisco recommends that you disable the ACLs on the interfaces before you change \\nthe statements in the list. By doing so, you avoid issues with the ACL during an interim state. First, if you delete an entire ACL, and leave the IP ACL enabled on an interface with the   ip access-group command, IOS does not filter any packets (that was not always the case in far earlier IOS versions)! As soon as you add one ACL command to that enabled ACL, however, IOS starts filtering packets based on that ACL. Those interim ACL configurations could cause problems.\\nFor example, suppose you have ACL 101 enabled on S0/0/0 for output packets. You delete \\nlist 101 so that all packets are allowed through. Then, you enter a single access-list 101 \\ncommand. As soon as you press Enter, the list exists, and the router filters all packets exit-ing S0/0/0 based on the one-line list. If you want to enter a long ACL, you might temporari-ly filter packets you don’t want to filter! Therefore, the better way is to disable the list from the interface, make the changes to the list, and then reenable it on the interface .\\nTroubleshooting with IPv4 ACLs\\nThe use   of IPv4 ACLs makes troubleshooting IPv4 routing more difficult. Any data plane troubleshooting process can include a catchall phrase to include checking for ACLs. A network can have all hosts working, DHCP settings correct, all LANs working, all router interfaces working, and all routers having learned all routes to all subnets—and ACLs can still filter packets. Although ACLs provide that important service of filtering some packets, ACLs can make the troubleshooting process that much more difficult.\\nThis third of the three major sections of this chapter focuses on troubleshooting in the pres-\\nence of IPv4 ACLs. It breaks the discussion into two parts. The first part gives advice about common problems you might see on the exam, and how to find those with show commands \\nand some analysis. The second part then looks at how ACLs impact the  ping   command.\\nAnalyzing ACL Behavior in a Network\\nACLs   cause some of the biggest challenges when troubleshooting problems in real networking jobs. The packets created by commands like ping  and traceroute  do not \\nexactly match the fields in packets created by end users. The ACLs sometimes filter the ping  and traceroute  traffic, making the network engineer think some other kind of \\nproblems exists when no problems exist at all. Or, the problem with the end-user traffic \\nptg17396363478  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nreally is caused by the ACL, but the ping and traceroute traffic works fine, because the \\nACL matches the end-user traffic with a deny  action but matches the ping and traceroute \\ntraffic with a permit  action.\\nAs a result, much of ACL troubleshooting requires thinking about ACL configuration versus the packets that flow in a network, rather than using a couple of IOS commands that iden-tify the root cause of the problem. The show commands that help are those that give you the configuration of the ACL, and on what interfaces the ACL is enabled. You can also see statistics about which ACL statements have been matched. And using pings and traceroutes can help—as long as you remember that ACLs may apply different actions to those packets versus the end-user traffic.\\nThe following phrases the ACL troubleshooting steps into a list for easier study. The list \\nalso expands on the idea of analyzing each ACL in Step 3. None of the ideas in the list are new compared to this chapter and the previous chapter, but it acts more as a summary of the common issues:\\nStep 1. Determine on which interfaces ACLs are enabled, and in which direction (show running-config, show ip interfaces).\\nStep 2. Find the configuration of each ACL (show access-lists, show ip access-lists, show running-config).\\nStep 3. Analyze the ACLs to predict which packets should match the ACL, focusing on the following points  :\\nA. Misordered ACLs: Look for misordered ACL statements. IOS uses first-match logic when searching an ACL.\\nB. Reversed source/destination addresses: Analyze the router interface, the direction in which the ACL is enabled, compared to the location of the IP address ranges matched by the ACL statements. Make sure the source IP address field could match packets with that source IP address, rather than the destination, and vice versa for the destination IP address field. \\nC. Reversed source/destination ports: For extended ACLs that reference UDP or TCP port numbers, continue to analyze the location and direction of the ACL versus the hosts, focusing on which host acts as the server using a well-known port. Ensure that the ACL statement matches the correct source or destination port depending on whether the server sent or will receive the packet.\\nD. Syntax: Remember that extended ACL commands must use the tcp and udp keywords if the command needs to check the port numbers.\\nE. Syntax: Note that ICMP packets do not use UDP or TCP; ICMP is consid-ered to be another protocol matchable with the icmp keyword (instead of tcp or udp).\\nF. Explicit deny any: Instead of using the implicit deny any at the end of \\neach ACL, use an explicit configuration command to deny all traffic at the end of the ACL so that the show command counters increment when that action is taken.\\nG. Dangerous inbound ACLs: Watch for inbound ACLs, especially those with deny all logic at the end of the ACL. These ACLs may discard incoming overhead protocols, like routing protocol messages.\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  479\\nH. Standard ACL location: Standard ACLs enabled close to the source of \\nmatched addresses can discard the packets as intended, but also discard packets that should be allowed through. Always pay close attention to the requirements of the ACL in these cases.\\nThis chapter (and the previous) have already discussed the details of Step 3. The first two steps are important for Simlet questions in case you are not allowed to look at the configu-ration; you can use other show commands to determine all the relevant ACL configuration. The next few pages show some of the related commands and how they can uncover some of the issues described in the just-completed ACL troubleshooting checklist  . \\nACL Troubleshooting Commands\\nIf you   suspect ACLs are causing a problem, the first problem-isolation step is to find the location and direction of the ACLs. The fastest way to do this is to look at the output of the show running-config command and to look for ip access-group commands under each \\ninterface. However, in some cases, enable mode access may not be allowed, and show com-mands are required. Instead, use the   show ip interfaces command to find which ACLs are \\nenabled on which interfaces, as shown in Example 17-8  .\\nExample 17-8 Sample show ip interface Command\\nR1> show ip interface s0/0/1\\nSerial0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Internet address is 10.1.2.1/24\\n  Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255\\n  Address determined by setup command  MTU is 1500 bytes\\n  Helper address is not set\\n  Directed broadcast forwarding is disabled\\n  Multicast reserved groups joined: 224.0.0.9  Outgoing access list is not set\\n  Inbound  access list is 102\\n! roughly 26 more lines omitted for brevity\\nNote that the command output lists whether an ACL is enabled, in both directions, and \\nwhich ACL it is. The example shows an abbreviated version of the show ip interface \\nS0/0/1 command, which lists messages for just this one interface. The show ip interface \\ncommand would list the same messages for every interface in the router    .\\nStep 2 of the ACL troubleshooting checklist then says that the contents of the ACL must be \\nfound. Again, the quickest way to look at the ACL is to use the show running-config command. If it’s not available, the   show access-lists and   show ip access-lists commands list the same \\ndetails shown in the configuration. These commands also list a useful counter that lists the num-ber of packets that have matched each line in the ACL. Example 17-9 shows an example.\\nExample 17-9 show ip access-lists Command Example\\nR1# show ip access-lists\\nExtended IP access list 102\\n    10 permit ip 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.1.4.0 0.0.1.255 (15 matches)\\nptg17396363480  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe   counter can be very useful for troubleshooting. If you can generate traffic that you \\nthink should match a particular line in an ACL, then you should see the matches increment on that counter. If you keep generating traffic that should match, but that line’s counter never goes up, then those packets do not match that line in that ACL. Those packets could be matching an earlier line in the same ACL, or might not even be reaching that router (for any reason).\\nAfter the locations, directions, and configuration details of the various ACLs have been \\ndiscovered in Steps 1 and 2, the hard part begins—analyzing what the ACL really does. For example, one of the most common tasks you will do is to look at the address fields and decide the range of addresses matched by that field. Remember, for an ACL that sits in a router configuration, you can easily find the address range. The low end of the range is the address (the first number), and the high end of the range is the sum of the address and wildcard mask. For instance, with ACL 102 in Example 17-9, which is obviously con-figured in some router, the ranges are as follows:\\nSource 10.1.2.0, wildcard 0.0.0.255: Matches from 10.1.2.0 through 10.1.2.255\\nDestination 10.1.4.0, wildcard 0.0.1.255: Matches from 10.1.4.0 through 10.1.5.255\\nThe next few pages work through some analysis of a few of the items from Step 3 in the \\ntroubleshooting checklist  .\\nExample Issue: Reversed Source/Destination IP Addresses\\nIOS    cannot recognize a case in which you attempt to match the wrong addresses in the source or destination address field. So, be ready to analyze the enabled ACLs and their direction versus the location of different subnets in the network. Then ask yourself about the packets that drive that ACL: what could the source and destination addresses of those packets be? And does the ACL match the correct address ranges, or not?\\nFor example, consider Figure 17-11, a figure that will be used in several troubleshooting \\nexamples in this chapter. The requirements for the next ACL follow the figure.\\n10.1.1.0/24\\n10.2.2.0/30\\n10.4.4.0/2310.3.3.0/25\\nR1G0/1 G0/2 G0/2 G0/1\\n.1 .1 .2 .2BA\\n.9R2\\nFigure 17-11 Example Network Used in IPv4 ACL Troubleshooting Examples\\nFor this next ACL, the requirements ask that you allow and prevent various flows, as follows:\\n■ Allow hosts in subnet 10.3.3.0/25 and subnet 10.1.1.0/24 to communicate\\n■ Prevent hosts in subnet 10.4.4.0/23 and subnet 10.1.1.0/24 from communicating\\n■ Allow all other communications between hosts in network 10.0.0.0\\n■ Prevent all other communications\\nExample 17-10 shows the ACL used in this case on R2. At first glance, it meets all those requirements straight down the list   . \\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  481\\nExample 17-10 Troubleshooting Example 2 per Step 3B: Source and Destination \\nMismatch\\nR2# show ip access-lists\\nStandard IP access list Step3B\\n 10 permit 10.3.3.0 0.0.0.127  \\n 20 deny 10.4.4.0 0.0.1.255  \\n 30 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 (12 matches)R2#\\nR2# show ip interface G0/2 | include Inbound\\n  Inbound access list is Step3B\\nThe problem in this case is that the ACL has been enabled on R2’s G0/2 interface, inbound. \\nPer the figure, packets coming from a source address in subnets 10.3.3.0/25 and 10.4.4.0/23 should be forwarded out R2’s G0/2 interface, rather than coming in that interface. So, do not let the matching logic in the ACL that perfectly mirrors the requirements fool you; make sure and check the location of the ACL, direction, and the location of the IP addresses.\\nNote that Step 3C suggests a similar issue regarding matching well-known ports with TCP \\nand UDP. The earlier section in this chapter titled “Matching TCP and UDP Port Numbers” has already discussed those ideas in plenty of detail. Just make sure to check where the server sits versus the location and direction of the ACL   .\\nSteps 3D and 3E: Common Syntax Mistakes \\nSteps   3D and 3E describe a couple of common syntax mistakes. First, to match a TCP port in an ACL statement, you must use a tcp protocol keyword instead of ip or any other value. Otherwise, IOS rejects the command as having incorrect syntax. Same issue with trying to match UDP ports: a udp protocol keyword is required. \\nTo match ICMP , IOS includes an    icmp  protocol keyword to use instead of tcp or udp. In \\nfact, the main conceptual mistake is to think of ICMP as an application protocol that uses \\neither UDP or TCP; it uses neither. To match all ICMP messages, for instance, use the permit \\nicmp any any command in an extended named   ACL.\\nExample Issue: Inbound ACL Filters Routing Protocol Packets\\nA router   bypasses outbound ACL logic for packets the router itself generates. That might \\nsound like common sense, but it is important to stop and think about that fact in context. A router can have an outgoing ACL, and that ACL can and will discard packets that the router receives in one interface and then tries to forward out some other interface. But if the rout-er creates the packet, for instance, for a routing protocol message, the router bypasses the outbound ACL logic for that packet. \\nHowever, a router does not bypass inbound ACL logic. If an ACL has an inbound ACL \\nenabled, and a packet arrives in that interface, the router checks the ACL. Any and all IPv4 packets are considered by the ACL—including important overhead packets like routing protocol updates.\\nFor example, consider a seemingly good ACL on a router, like the Step3G ACL in Example \\n17-11. That ACL lists a couple of permit commands, and has an implicit deny any at the end of the list. At first, it looks like any other reasonable   ACL. \\nptg17396363482  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 17-11 Troubleshooting Example 2 per Step 3G: Filtering RIP by Accident\\nR1# show ip access-lists\\nStandard IP access list Step3G 10 permit host 10.4.4.1  \\n 20 permit 10.3.3.0 0.0.0.127 (12 matches)\\n! using the implicit deny to match everything else\\nR1#\\n! On router R1:\\nR1# show ip interface G0/2 | include Inbound  Inbound access list is Step3G\\nNow look at the location and direction (inbound on R1, on R1’s G0/2) and consider that \\nlocation versus the topology Figure 17-11 for a moment. None of those permit statements match the RIP updates sent by R2, sent out R2’s G0/1 interface toward R1. RIP messages use UDP (well-known port 520), and R2’s G0/1 interface is 10.2.2.2 per the figure. R1 would match incoming RIP messages with the implicit deny all at the end of the list. The symptoms in this case, assuming only that one ACL exists, would be that R1 would not learn routes from R2, but R2 could still learn RIP routes from R1.\\nOf the three routing protocols discussed in the ICND1 and ICND2 books, RIPv2 uses UDP \\nas a transport, while OSPF and EIGRP do not even use a transport protocol. As a result, to match RIPv2 packets with an ACL, you need the udp keyword and you need to match well-known port 520. OSPF and EIGRP can be matched with special keywords as noted in Table 17-7. The table also list the addresses used by each   protocol.\\nTable 17-7 Key Fields for Matching Routing Protocol Messages\\nProtocol Source IP Address Destination IP Addresses ACL Protocol Keyword\\nRIPv2 Source interface 224.0.0.9 udp (port 520)\\nOSPF Source interface 224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6 ospf\\nEIGRP Source interface 224.0.0.10 eigrp\\nExample 17-12 shows a sample ACL with three lines, one to match each routing protocol, \\njust to show the syntax. Note that in this case, the ACL matches the address fields with the any keyword. You could include lines like these in any inbound ACL to ensure that routing protocol packets would be permitted  .\\nExample 17-12 Example ACL that Matches all RIPv2, OSPF, and EIGRP with a Permit\\nR1# show ip access-lists\\nip access-list extended RoutingProtocolExample 10 permit udp any any eq 520  \\n 20 permit ospf any any\\n 30 permit eigrp any any\\n remark a complete ACL would also need more statements here\\nR1#\\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  483\\nACL Interactions with Router-Generated Packets\\nRouters   bypass outbound ACL logic for packets generated by that same router. This logic \\nhelps avoid cases in which a router discards its own overhead traffic. This logic applies to packets that a router creates for overhead processes like routing protocols, as well as for commands, like ping and traceroute. This section adds a few perspectives about how ACLs impact troubleshooting, and how this exception to outbound ACL logic applies, particularly commands used from the router CLI.\\nLocal ACLs and a Ping from a Router\\nFor the first scenario, think about a ping command issued by a router. The command gener-ates packets, and the router sends those packets (holding the ICMP echo request messages) out one of the router interfaces, and typically some ICMP echo reply messages are received back. As it turns out, not all ACLs will attempt to filter those packets. \\nAs a backdrop to discuss what happens, Figure 17-12 illustrates a simple network topol-\\nogy with two routers connected to a serial link. Note that in this figure four IP ACLs exist, named A, B, C, and D, as noted by the thick arrows in the drawing. That is, ACL A is an out-bound ACL on R1’s S0/0/0, ACL B is an   inbound ACL on R2’s S0/0/1, and so on.\\nS0/0/0G0/2S0/0/1G0/1R1 R2S1H1\\nH2SW1A AAB\\nC D\\nFigure 17-12 Sample Network with IP ACLs in Four Locations\\nAs an   example, consider a ping command issued from R1’s CLI (after a user connects to R1’s \\nCLI using SSH). The   ping command pings server S1’s IP address. The IPv4 packets with the \\nICMP messages flow from R1 to S1 and back again. Which of those four ACLs could possi-bly filter the ICMP Echo Request toward S1, and the ICMP Echo Reply back toward R1?\\nRouters bypass their own outbound ACLs for packets generated by the router, as shown in \\nFigure 17-13. Even though ACL A exists as an outgoing ACL on Router R1, R1 bypasses its own outgoing ACL logic of ACL A for the ICMP Echo Requests generated by R1  . \\nS0/0/0G0/2S0/0/1G0/1R1 R2S1H1\\nH2SW1A AAB\\nC Dping S1 -\\nignore ACL A\\nFigure 17-13 R1 Ignores Outgoing ACL for Packets Created by Its Own ping Command\\nRouter Self-Ping of a Serial Interface IPv4 Address\\nThe      previous example uses a router’s ping command when pinging a host. However, net-\\nwork engineers often need to ping router IP addresses, including using a self-ping. The term \\nself-ping refers to a ping of a device’s own IPv4 address. And for point-to-point serial links, \\nptg17396363484  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\na self-ping actually sends packets over the serial link, which causes some interesting effects \\nwith ACLs.\\nWhen a user issues a self-ping for that local router’s serial IP address, the router actually \\nsends the ICMP echo request out the link to the other router. The neighboring router then receives the packet and routes the packet with the ICMP echo request back to the original router. Figure 17-14 shows an example of a self-ping (ping 172.16.4.1) of Router R1’s own IP address on a point-to-point serial link, with the ICMP echo request out the link to Router R2. At Step 2, R2 treats it like any other packet not destined for one of R2’s own IPv4 addresses: R2 routes the packet. Where? Right back to Router R1, as shown in the figure.\\nS0/0/0G0/2R1 R2S1SW11 ping 172.16.4.1\\nSend Out S0/0/0\\nDestination 172.16.4.1\\nRoute Out S0/0/12\\nS0/0/1172.16.4.1 172.16.4.2Echo Request\\nEcho Request\\nFigure 17-14 The First Steps in a Self-Ping on R1, for R1’s S0/0/0 IP Address\\nNow      think about those four ACLs in the earlier figures compared to Figure 17-14. R1 gen-\\nerates the ICMP echo request, so R1 bypasses outbound ACL A. ACLs B, C, and D could filter the packet. Note that the packet sent by R2 back to R1 is not generated by R2 in this case; R2 is just routing R1’s original packet back to R1. \\nA self-ping of a serial interface actually tests many parts of a point-to-point serial link, as \\nfollows:\\n■ The link must work at Layers 1, 2, and 3. Specifically, both routers must have a working(up/up) serial interface, with correct IPv4 addresses configured.\\n■ ACLs B, C, and D must permit the ICMP echo request and reply packets.\\nSo, when troubleshooting, if you choose to use self-pings and they fail, but the serial inter-faces are in an up/up state, do not forget to check to see whether the ACLs have filtered the Internet Control      Management Protocol (ICMP) traffic.\\nRouter Self-Ping of an Ethernet Interface IPv4 Address\\nA self-ping of a router’s own Ethernet interface IP address works a little like a self-ping of a router’s serial IP address, but with a couple of twists:\\n■ Like with serial interface, the local router interface must be working (in an up/up state);otherwise, the ping fails.\\n■ Unlike serial interfaces, the router does not forward the ICMP messages physically outthe interface, so security features on neighboring switches (like port security) or routers(like ACLs) cannot possibly filter the messages used by the ping command.\\n■ Like serial interfaces, an incoming IP ACL on the local router does process the routerself-ping of an Ethernet-based IP address.\\nFigure 17-15 walks through an example. In this case, R2 issues a ping 172.16.2.2 command \\nto ping its own G0/2 IP address. Just like with a self-ping on serial links, R2 creates the \\nptg1739636317Chapter 17: Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists  485\\nICMP echo request. However, R2 basically processes the ping down its own TCP/IP stack \\nand back up again, with the ICMP echo never leaving the router’s Ethernet interface. R2 does check the Ethernet interface status, showing a failure if the interface is not up/up. R2 does not apply outbound ACL logic to the packet, because R2 created the packet, but R2 will apply inbound ACL logic to the packet, as if the packet had been physically received on the      interface.\\nG0/2R2S1SW1ping 172.16.2.2 -\\nCheck G0/2 StatusCheck Incoming ACL\\n172.16.2.2\\nF\\nFigure 17-15 Self-Ping of a Router’s Ethernet Address\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

These tools balance the tradeoffs of which types of traffic receive network resources, and when, giving more preference to some traffic, and less preference to others.\\nIn the entire history of CCNA R&S, the exam topics have not focused on QoS beyond \\nthe barest small mention—until this latest version of the ICND2 (200-105) and CCNA (200-125) exams.

Queue 3\\nFoundation Topics\\nIntroduction to QoS\\nRouters typically sit at the WAN edge, with both WAN interfaces and LAN interfaces. \\nThose LAN interfaces typically      run at much faster speeds, while the WAN interfaces run at slower speeds. While that slower WAN interface is busy sending the packets waiting in the router, hundreds or even thousands more IP packets could arrive in the LAN interfaces, all needing to be forwarded out that same WAN interface. What should the router do? Send them all, in the same order in which they arrived? Prioritize the packets, to send some ear-lier than others, preferring one type of traffic over another? Discard some of the packets when the number of packets waiting to exit the router gets too large?\\nThat first paragraph described some of the many classic Quality of Service (QoS) questions \\nin networking. QoS refers to the tools that networking devices use to apply some different treatment to packets in the network as they pass through the device. For instance, the WAN edge router would queue packets waiting for the WAN interface to be available. The router could also use a queue scheduling algorithm to determine which packets should be sent next, using some other order than the arrival order—giving some packets better service, and some worse service.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  491\\nQoS: Managing Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter, and Loss\\nCisco offers a wide range of QoS tools on both routers and switches. All these tools give \\nyou the means to manage   four characteristics of network traffic:\\n■Bandwidth\\n■Delay\\n■Jitter\\n■Loss\\nBandwidth refers to the speed of a link, in      bits per second (bps). But while we think of bandwidth as speed, it helps to also think of bandwidth as the capacity of the link, in terms of how many bits can be sent over the link per second. The networking device’s QoS tools determine what packet is sent over the link next, so the networking device is in control of which messages get access to the bandwidth next, and how much of that bandwidth (capac-ity) each type of traffic gets over time.\\nFor example, consider that typical WAN edge router that has hundreds of packets waiting \\nto exit the WAN link. An engineer might configure a queuing tool to reserve 10 percent of the bandwidth for voice traffic, 50 percent for mission-critical data applications, and leave the rest of the bandwidth for all other types of traffic. The queuing tool could then use those settings to make the choice about which packets to send next.\\nDelay can be described        as one-way delay or round-trip delay. One-way delay refers to \\nthe time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination host. \\nRound-trip delay counts the one-way delay plus the time for the receiver of the first packet to send back a packet—in other words, the time it takes to send one packet between two hosts, and receive one back. Many different individual actions impact delay; this chapter will discuss a few of those, including queuing and shaping delay. \\nJitter refers to the variation in one-way delay      between consecutive packets sent by the same \\npacket. For instance, imagine an application sends a few hundred packets to one particular host. The first packet’s one-way delay is 300 milliseconds (300 ms, or .3 seconds). The next packet’s one-way delay is 300 ms; so is the third’s; and so on. In that case, there is no jitter. However, if instead the first packet has a one-way delay of 300 ms, the next has a one-way delay of 310 ms, and the next has 325 ms, then there is some variation in the delay, 10 ms between packets 1 and 2, and another 15 ms between packets 2 and 3. That difference is called jitter. \\nFinally, loss refers to the amount      of lost messages, usually as a percentage of packets sent. \\nThe comparison is simple: If the sender for some application sends 100 packets, and only \\n98 arrive at the destination, that particular application flow experienced 2 percent loss. Loss can be caused by many factors, but often, people think of loss as something caused by faulty cabling or poor WAN services. That is one cause. However, more loss happens because of the normal operation of the networking devices, in which the devices’ queues get too full, so the device has nowhere to put new packets, and discards the packet. Several QoS tools manage queuing systems to help control and avoid loss.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A, B, E 2 B, C 3 A, B, C 4 D 5 A, D 6 C, D\\nptg17396363492  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTypes of Traffic\\nWith QoS, a network engineer sets about to prefer one type of traffic over another in \\nregard to bandwidth, delay, jitter, and loss. Sometimes, that choice relates to the specific business. For example, if all the mission-critical applications sit on servers in three known subnets, then the QoS plan could be set up to match packets going to/from that subnet, and give that traffic better treatment compared to other traffic. However, in other cases, the choice of how to apply QoS tools relates to the nature of different kinds of applications. Some applications have different QoS needs than others. This next topic compares the basic differences in QoS needs based on the type of traffic.\\nData Applications\\nFirst, consider a basic web     application, with a user at a PC or tablet. The user types in a URI to request a web page. That request may require a single packet going to the web server, but it may result in hundreds or thousands of packets coming back to the web client, as shown in Figure 18-1.\\nWeb Server\\nHTTP GET\\n500 Packets...\\nFigure 18-1 Interactive Data Application\\nNOTE If you wonder how one web page might require thousands of packets, consider \\nthis math: with a 1500-byte IP maximum transmission unit (MTU), the data part of a TCP segment could be at most 1460 bytes (1500 bytes, minus 20 bytes each for the IP and TCP header). 1000 such packets total to 1,460,000 bytes, or about 1.5 MB. It is easy to imagine a web page with just a few graphics that totals more than 1.5 MB in size.\\nSo, what is the impact of bandwidth, delay, jitter, and  loss on an interactive web-based application? First, the packets require a certain amount of bandwidth capacity. As for delay, each of those packets from the server to the client takes some amount of one-way delay, with some jitter as well. Of the 500 packets shown in Figure 18-1, if some are lost (transmis-sion errors, discarded by devices, or other reasons), then the server’s TCP logic will retrans-mit—but parts of the web page may not show up right away.\\nWhile QoS tools focus on managing bandwidth, delay, jitter, and loss, the user mainly cares \\nabout the quality of the overall experience. For instance, with a web application, how long after clicking do you see something useful in your web browser? So, as a user, you care about the   Quality of Experience (QoE), which is a term referring to users’ perception of \\ntheir use of the application on the network. QoS tools directly impact bandwidth, delay, jit-ter, and loss, which then should have some overall good effect to influence the users’ QoE. And you can use QoS tools to create a better QoE for more important traffic—for instance, you might give certain business-critical applications better QoS treatment, which improves QoE for users of those apps.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  493\\nIn contrast, a noninteractive data application (historically called   batch traffic)—for instance, \\ndata backup or file transfers—has different QoS requirements than interactive data applica-tions. Batch applications typically send more data than interactive applications, but because no one is sitting there waiting to see something pop on the screen, the delay and jitter does not matter much. Much more important for these applications is meeting the need to com-plete the larger task (transferring files) within a larger time window. QoS tools can be used to provide enough bandwidth to meet the capacity needs of these applications, and manage loss to reduce the number     of retransmissions.\\nVoice and Video Applications\\nVoice and video applications each have a similar breakdown of interactive and noninterac-tive flows. To make the main points about both voice and video, this section looks more deeply at voice traffic.\\nBefore looking at voice, though, first think about the use of the term   flow in networking. A \\nflow is all the data moving from one application to another over the network, with one flow \\nfor each direction. For example, if you open a website and connect to a web server, the web page content that moves from the server to the client is one flow. Listen to some music with a music app on your phone, and that creates a flow from your app to the music app’s server, and a flow from the server back to your phone. From a voice perspective, a phone call between two IP phones would create a flow for each direction. For video, it could be the traffic from one video surveillance camera collected by security software. \\nNow on to voice, specifically         Voice over IP (VoIP). VoIP defines the means to take the \\nsound made at one telephone and send it inside IP packets over an IP network, playing the sound back on the other telephone. Figure 18-2 shows the general idea. The steps in the figure include\\nStep 1. The phone user makes a phone call and begins speaking.\\nStep 2. A chip called  a codec processes (digitizes) the sound to create a binary code \\n(160 bytes with the G.711 codec, for example) for a certain time period (usu-\\nally 20 ms).\\nStep 3. The phone places the data into an IP packet. \\nStep 4. The phone sends the packet to the destination IP phone.\\nIP UDP RTP Voice BytesVoice Bytes CODECIP Phone Internals\\n12\\n3\\n4\\nFigure 18-2 Creating VoIP Packets with an IP Phone and a G.711 Codec\\nIf you work through the math a bit, this single call, with the G.711 Codec, requires about 80 \\nKbps of bandwidth (ignoring the data link header and trailer overhead). Counting the head-ers and VoIP payload as shown in the figure, each of the IP packets has 200 bytes. Each holds 20 ms of digitized voice, so the phone sends 50 packets per second. 50 packets at 200 \\nptg17396363494  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nbytes each is 10,000 bytes per second, or 80,000 bits per second, which is 80 Kbps. Other \\nvoice codecs require even less bandwidth, with the commonly used G.729 taking about 24 Kbps (again ignoring data link overhead). \\nAt first, it may look like VoIP calls require little in regard to QoS. For bandwidth, a single \\nvoice call or flow requires only a little bandwidth in comparison to many data applications. However, interactive voice does require a much better level of quality for delay, jitter, and loss. \\nFor instance, think about making a phone call with high one-way delay. You finish speaking, \\nand pause for the other person to respond. And they do not, so you speak again—and hear the other person’s voice overlaid on your own. The problem: too much delay. Or, consider calls for which the sound breaks up. The problem? It could have been packet loss, or it could have been jitter. \\nYou can achieve good-quality voice traffic over an IP network, but you must implement \\nQoS to do so. QoS tools set about to give different types of traffic the QoS behavior they need. Cisco’s Enterprise QoS Solution Reference Network Design Guide, which   itself quotes other sources in addition to relying on Cisco’s long experience in implementing QoS, suggests the following guidelines for interactive voice:\\n■Delay (one-way): 150 ms or less\\n■Jitter: 30 ms or less\\n■Loss: 1% or less\\nIn comparison, interactive voice requires more attention than interactive data applications for QoS features. Data applications generally tolerate more delay, jitter, and loss than voice (and video). A single voice call does generally take less bandwidth than a typical data appli-cation, but that bandwidth requirement is consistent. Data applications tend to be bursty, with       data bursts in reaction to the user doing something with the application. \\nVideo has a much more varied     set of QoS requirements. Generally, think of video like \\nvoice, but with a much higher bandwidth requirement than voice (per flow), and similar requirements for low delay, jitter, and loss. As for bandwidth, video can use a variety of codecs that impact the amount of data sent, but many other technical features impact the amount of bandwidth required for a single video flow. (For instance, a sporting event with lots of movement on screen takes more bandwidth than a news anchor reading the news in front of a solid background with little movement.) This time quoting from  End-to-End QoS \\nNetwork Design, Second Edition (Cisco Press, 2013), some requirements for video include\\n■Bandwidth: 384 Kbps to 20+ Mbps\\n■Delay (one-way): 200–400 ms\\n■Jitter: 30–50 ms\\n■Loss: 0.1%–1%\\nNOTE End-to-End QoS Network Design is written by some of the same people who cre-\\nated the Cisco Enterprise QoS Solutions Reference Network Design Guide (available at Cisco.com). If you are looking for a book to dig into more depth on QoS, this book is an excellent modern reference for Cisco QoS.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  495\\nQoS as Mentioned in This Book\\nQoS tools change the QoS characteristics of certain flows in the network. The rest of the \\nchapter focuses on the specific tools mentioned in the sub-bullets under the lone CCNA R&S exam topic about QoS, presented in the following major sections:\\n■“Classification and Marking,” about the marking of packets and the definition of trust\\nboundaries.\\n■“Congestion Management (Queuing)” describes the scheduling of packets to give one\\ntype of packet priority over another.\\n■“Shaping and Policing” explains these two tools together because they are often used on\\nopposite ends of a link.\\n■“Congestion Avoidance” addresses how to manage the packet loss that occurs when net-\\nwork devices get too busy.\\nQoS on Switches and Routers\\nBefore moving on to several sections of the chapter about specific QoS tools, let me make a point about the terms packet and frame as used in this chapter.\\nThe QoS tools discussed in this chapter can be used    on both switches and routers. There are \\nsome differences in the features, and differences in implementation, due to the differences of internal architecture between routers and switches. However, to the depth discussed here, the descriptions apply equally to both LAN switches and IP routers.\\nThis chapter uses the word  packet in a general way, to refer to any message being processed \\nby a networking device, just for convenience. Normally, throughout this book and the \\nICND1 Cert Guide, the term packet refers to the IP header and encapsulated headers and data, but without the data link header and trailer. The term frame refers  to the data link \\nheader/trailer with its encapsulated headers and data. For this chapter, those differences do not matter to the discussion, but at the same time, the discussion often shows a message that sometimes is literally a packet (without the data link header/trailer) and sometimes a frame.\\nThroughout the chapter, the text uses packet for all messages, because the fact of whether \\nor not the message happens to have a data link header/trailer at that point is immaterial to the basic discussion of features.\\nAdditionally, note that all the examples in the chapter refer to routers, just to be consistent.\\nClassification and Marking\\nThe first QoS tool discussed in this chapter, classification and marking, or simply marking, \\nrefers to a type of QoS tool that classifies packets based on their header contents, and then marks the message by changing some bits in specific header fields. This section looks first at the role of classification across all QoS tools, and then it examines the marking feature.\\nClassification Basics\\nQoS tools sit in the path     that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch, much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled on an \\nptg17396363496  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ninterface. Also like ACLs, QoS tools    are enabled for a direction: packets entering the \\ninterface (before the forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision). \\nThe term classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make \\na choice to take some QoS action. So, again comparing QoS tools to ACLs, ACLs perform classification and filtering; that is, ACLs match (classify) packet headers. ACLs can have the purpose (action) of choosing which packets to discard. QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against. Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in this chapter, such as queu-ing, shaping, policing, and so on.\\nFor example, consider the internal processing done by a router as shown in Figure 18-3. \\nIn this case, an output queuing tool has been enabled on an interface. Routers use queuing tools to place some packets in one output queue, other packets in another, and so on, when the outgoing interface happens to be busy. Then, when the outgoing interface becomes available to send another message, the queuing tool’s scheduler        algorithm can pick the next message from any one of the queues, prioritizing traffic based on the rules configured by the network engineer.\\nForward Classify\\nTransmitRouter Internals\\nQueue\\nR1Scheduling\\n(Prioritization)\\nFigure 18-3 Big Idea: Classification for Queuing in a Router\\nThe figure shows the internals of a router, and what happens to the packet during part of that internal processing, moving left to right inside the router, as follows:  \\nStep 1. The router makes a forwarding (routing) decision.\\nStep 2. The output queuing tool uses classification logic to determine which packets \\ngo into which output queue.\\nStep 3. The router holds the packets in the output queue waiting for the outgoing \\ninterface to be available to send the next message.\\nStep 4. The queuing tool’s scheduling logic chooses the next packet, effectively priori-\\ntizing one packet over another.\\nWhile the example shows a queuing tool, note that the queuing tool requires the ability to \\nclassify messages by comparing the messages to the     configuration, much like ACLs.\\nMatching (Classification) Basics\\nNow think about classification      from an enterprise-wide perspective, which helps us appreci-ate the need for marking. Every QoS tool can examine various headers to make compari-sons to classify packets. However, you might apply QoS tools on most every device in the network, sometimes at both ingress and egress on most of the interfaces. Using complex \\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  497\\nmatching of many header fields in every device and on most interfaces requires lots of \\nconfiguration. The work to match packets can even degrade device performance of some devices. So, while you could have every device use complex packet matching, doing so is a poor strategy.\\nA better strategy, one recommended both by Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex \\nmatching early in the life of a packet, and then marking the packet. Marking means        that the \\nQoS tool changes one or more header fields, setting a value in the header. Several header fields have been designed for the purpose of marking the packets for QoS processing. Then, devices that process the packet later in its life can use much simpler classification logic.\\nFigure 18-4 shows an example, with a PC on the left sending an IP packet to some host \\noff of the right side of the figure (not shown). Switch SW1, the first networking device to forward the packet, does some complex comparisons and marks the packet’s Differentiated Services Code Point   (DSCP) field, a 6-bit field in the IP header meant for QoS marking. The next three devices that process this message—SW2, R1, and R2—then use simpler match-ing to classify the packet by comparing the packet’s DSCP value, placing packets with one      DSCP value in class 1, and packets with another DSCP value in class 2.\\nWANDSCP=X? CLASS 1.\\nDSCP=Y? CLASS 2.\\nMark DSCP\\nat Ingress\\n* …\\nSW1 SW2 R1 R2More Complex Matching Less Complex Matching\\nFigure 18-4 Systematic Classification and Marking for the Enterprise\\nClassification on Routers with ACLs and NBAR \\nNow that you know the basics of what      classification and marking do together, this section \\ntakes the discussion a little deeper with a closer look at classification on routers, which is followed by a closer look at the marking function.\\nFirst, QoS classification sounds a lot like what ACLs do, and it should. In fact, many QoS \\ntools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL, with this kind of logic:\\nFor any packet matched by the ACL with a permit action, consider that packet a match \\nfor QoS, so do a particular QoS action.\\nAs a reminder, Figure 18-5 shows the IP and TCP header. All these fields       are matchable for \\nQoS classification.\\nIP Header TCP Header\\nMiscellaneous\\nHeader\\nFieldsProtocol\\n6 (TCP)Header\\nChecksumSource IP\\nAddressDestination IP\\nAddressOptionsSource\\nPortDest.\\nPortRest\\nof\\nTCP9 1 2 4 4 Variable 2 2 16+\\n6 = TCP\\nFigure 18-5 Classification with Five Fields Used by Extended ACLs\\nptg17396363498  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNow think about the enterprise’s QoS plan for a moment. That plan should list details like \\nwhich types of traffic should be classified as being in the same class for queuing purpose, for shaping, and for any other QoS tool. That plan should detail the fields in the header that can be matched. For instance, if all the IP phones sit in subnets within the range of address-es 10.3.0.0/16, then the QoS plan should state that. Then the network engineer could con-figure an extended ACL to match all packets to/from IP addresses inside 10.3.0.0/16 and apply appropriate QoS actions to that voice traffic.\\nHowever, not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more \\nchallenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) can be used. NBAR is basically in its second major version, called NBAR2, or next-generation NBAR. In short, NBAR2 matches packets for classification         in a large variety of ways that are very use-ful for QoS. \\nNBAR2 looks far beyond what an ACL can examine in a message. Many applications cannot \\nbe identified based on well-known port alone. NBAR solves those problems.\\nCisco also organizes what NBAR can match in ways that make it easy to separate the traffic \\ninto different classes. For instance, the Cisco WebEx application provides audio and video conferencing on the web. In a QoS plan, you might want to classify WebEx differently than other video traffic, and classify it differently than voice calls between IP phones. That is, you might classify WebEx traffic and give it a unique DSCP marking. NBAR provides easy built-in matching ability for WebEx, plus well over 1000 different subcategories of applica-tions. \\nJust to drive the point home with NBAR, Example 18-1 lists four lines of help output for \\none of many NBAR configuration commands. I chose a variety of items that might be more memorable. With the use of the keywords on the left in the correct configuration command, you could match the following: entertainment video from Amazon, video from Cisco’s video surveillance camera products, voice from Cisco IP Phones, and video from sports channel         ESPN. (NBAR refers to this idea of defining the characteristics of different applications as application signatures.)\\nExample 18-1 Example of the Many NBAR2 Matchable Applications\\nR1#(config)# class-map matchingexample\\nR1(config-cmap)# match protocol attribute category voice-and-video ?\\n! output heavily edited for length\\n  amazon-instant-video VOD service by Amazon\\n  cisco-ip-camera Cisco video surveillance camera\\n  cisco-phone Cisco IP Phones and PC-based Unified Communicators\\n  espn-video ESPN related websites and mobile applications video \\n  facetime Facetime video calling software\\n! Output snipped.\\nTo wrap up the discussion of NBAR for classification, compare the first two highlighted \\nentries in the output. Without NBAR, it would be difficult to classify an entertainment video from Amazon versus the video from a security camera, but those two highlighted entries show how you easily have classified that traffic differently. The third highlighted item shows how to match traffic for Cisco IP Phones (and PC-based equivalents), again mak-ing       for an easier match of packets of a particular type. \\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  499\\nMarking IP DSCP and Ethernet CoS\\nThe QoS plan for an enterprise centers on     creating classes of traffic that should receive \\ncertain types of QoS treatment. That plan would note how to classify packets into each classification, and the values that should be marked on the packets, basically labeling each packet with a number to associate it with that class. For example, that plan might state the following:\\n■Classify all voice payload traffic that is used for business purposes as IP DSCP EF and\\nCoS 5.\\n■Classify all video conferencing and other interactive video for business purposes as IP\\nDSCP AF41 and CoS 4.\\n■Classify all business-critical data application traffic as IP DSCP AF21 and CoS 2.\\nThis next topic takes a closer look at the specific fields that can be marked, defining the DSCP and CoS marking fields.\\nMarking the IP Header\\nMarking a QoS field in the IP header       works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host. When a host sends data, the host sends a data link frame that encapsulates an IP packet. Each router that forwards the IP packet discards the old data link header, and adds a new header. By marking the IP header, the marking can stay with the data from the first place it is marked until it reaches the desti-nation host.\\nIPv4 defines a    Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 header, as shown in Figure 18-6. The \\noriginal RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field gave us eight separate values—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which when convert-ed to decimal are decimal 0 through 7. \\nDSCP ECN\\nRFC 2474 RFC 3168IPPRFC 791\\nUnused\\nCurrent UseOld Use\\nType of\\nService(Rest of IP Header...)IP Header\\nFigure 18-6 IP Precedence and Differentiated Services Code Point Fields\\nNOTE Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some pur-\\npose, but were not used in practice to any significant extent.\\nptg17396363500  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhile a great idea, IPP gave us only eight different values to mark, so later RFCs redefined \\nthe ToS byte with the DSCP field. DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for 64 unique values that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common       method to use when doing QoS, and using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.\\nIPv6 has a similar field to   mark as well. The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP, with \\nthe byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte. Otherwise, think of \\nIPv4 and IPv6 being equivalent in terms of marking.\\nIPP and DSCP fields can be referenced by their decimal values as well as some convenient \\ntext names as well. The section titled “DiffServ Suggested       Marking Values” later in this sec-tion details some of the names.\\nMarking the Ethernet 802.1Q Header \\nAnother useful marking field exists        in the 802.1Q header, in a field originally defined by the IEEE 802.1p standard. This field sits in the third byte of the 4-byte 802.1Q header, as a 3-bit field, supplying eight possible values to mark (see Figure 18-7). It goes by two differ-ent     names: Class of Service, or CoS, and Priority Code Point, or PCP.\\n802.1 Q Ethernet\\nClass of Service (CoS) (3 Bits)\\nPriority Code Point (PCP)Type Data TrailerEthernet Frame\\nFigure 18-7 Class of Service Field in 802.1Q/p Header\\nThe figure uses two slightly different shades of gray (in print) for the Ethernet header and trailer fields versus the 802.1Q header, as a reminder: The 802.1Q header is not included in all Ethernet frames. The 802.1Q header only exists when 802.1Q trunking is used on a link. As a result, QoS tools can only make use of the CoS field for QoS features enabled on interfaces that use trunking, as shown in Figure 18-8. \\nWAN\\nCan Use CoSTrunk Trunk…\\nSW1 SW2 R1 R2\\nFigure 18-8 Useful Life of CoS Marking\\nFor instance, if the PC on the left were to send data to a server somewhere off the figure to the right, the DSCP field would exist for that entire trip. However, the CoS field would exist over the two trunks only, and would be useful mainly        on the four interfaces noted with the arrow lines.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  501\\nOther Marking Fields\\nOther marking fields exist in other headers as well. Table 18-2 lists those fields for refer-\\nence.\\nTable 18-2 Marking Fields\\nField Name Header(s) Length (bits) Where Used\\nDSCP IPv4, IPv6 6 End-to-end packet       \\nIPP IPv4, IPv6 3 End-to-end packet \\nCoS 802.1Q 3 Over VLAN trunk        \\nTID 802.11 3 Over Wi-Fi         \\nEXP MPLS Label 3 Over MPLS W AN      \\nDefining Trust Boundaries\\nThe end-user device can mark the DSCP field, and even the CoS field if trunking is used on \\nthe link. Would you, as the network engineer, trust those settings, and let your networking devices trust and react to those markings      for their various QoS actions? \\nMost of us would not, because anything the end user controls might be used inappropriate-\\nly at times. For instance, a PC user could know enough about DiffServ and DSCPs to know that most voice traffic is marked with a DSCP called   Expedited Forwarding (EF), which has a decimal value of 46. Voice traffic gets great QoS treatment, so PC users could mark all their traffic as DSCP 46, hoping to get great QoS treatment.\\nThe people creating a QoS plan for an enterprise have to choose where to place the trust \\nboundary for the network. The trust boundary refers to the point in the path of a packet flowing through the network at which the networking devices can trust the current QoS markings. That boundary typically sits in a device under the control of the IT staff.\\nFor instance, a typical trust boundary could be set in the middle of the first ingress switch in \\nthe network, as shown in Figure 18-9. The markings on the message as sent by the PC can-not be trusted. However, because SW1 performed classification and marking as the packets entered the switch, the markings can be trusted at that point.\\nSet DSCP and\\nCoS Inbound\\nWAN\\nTrust BoundaryUntrusted\\n…\\nSW2 R1 R2 SW1\\nFigure 18-9 Trusting Devices—PC\\nInterestingly, when the access layer includes an IP Phone, the phone is typically the trust \\nboundary, instead of the access layer switch. IP Phones can set the CoS and DSCP fields of the messages created by the phone, as well as those forwarded from the PC through the phone. The specific marking values are actually configured on the attached access switch. Figure 18-10 shows the typical trust boundary in this case, with notation of what the \\nptg17396363502  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nphone’s marking logic usually is: mark all of the PC’s traffic with a particular DSCP and/or \\nCoS, and the phone’s      traffic with different values.\\nSet PC DSCP and CoS\\nSet Phone DSCP and CoS\\nWAN\\nTrust Boundary…\\nSW1 SW2 R1 R2IP\\nFigure 18-10 Trusting Devices—IP Phone\\nDiffServ Suggested Marking Values\\nEverything in this chapter follows the DiffServ architecture as defined originally by RFC \\n2475, plus many other DiffServ RFCs. In particular, DiffServ goes beyond theory in several areas, including making suggestions about the specific DSCP values to use when marking IP packets. By suggesting specific markings for specific types of traffic, DiffServ hoped to create a consistent use of DSCP values in all networks. By doing so, product vendors could provide good default settings for their QoS features, QoS could work better between an enterprise and service provider, and many other benefits could be realized. \\nThe next two topics outline three sets of DSCP values as used in DiffServ.\\nExpedited Forwarding (EF)\\nDiffServ defines        the Expedited Forwarding (EF) DSCP value—a single value—as suggested \\nfor use for packets that need low latency (delay), low jitter, and low loss. The Expedited \\nForwarding RFC (RFC 3246) defines  the specific DSCP value (decimal 46) and an equiva-lent text name (Expedited Forwarding). QoS configuration commands allow the use of the decimal value or text name, but one purpose of having a text acronym to use is to make the        value more memorable, so many QoS configurations refer to the text names.\\nMost often QoS plans use EF to mark voice payload packets. With voice calls, some pack-\\nets carry voice payload, and other packets carry call signaling messages. Call signaling mes-sages set up (create) the voice call between two devices, and they do not require low delay, jitter, and loss. Voice payload packets carry the digitized voice, as shown back in Figure 18-2, and these packets do need better QoS. By default, Cisco IP Phones mark voice pay-load with EF, and mark voice signaling packets sent by the phone with another value called CS3.\\nAssured Forwarding (AF)\\nThe Assured Forwarding (AF) DiffServ RFC (2597) defines           a set of 12 DSCP values meant to be used in concert with each other. First, it defines the concept of four separate queues in a queuing system. Additionally, it defines three levels of drop priority within each queue for use with congestion avoidance tools. With four queues, and three drop priority classes per queue, you need 12 different DSCP markings, one for each combination of queue and \\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  503\\ndrop priority. (Queuing and congestion avoidance mechanisms are discussed later in this \\nchapter.)\\nAssured Forwarding defines the specific AF DSCP text names and equivalent decimal values \\nas listed in Figure 18-11. The text names follow a format of AFXY, with X referring to the queue (1 through 4), and Y referring to the drop priority (1 through 3).  \\nAF41\\n(34)AF42\\n(36)AF43\\n(38)Best Drop Worst Drop\\nAF31\\n(26)AF32\\n(28)AF33\\n(30)\\nAF21\\n(18)AF22\\n(20)AF23\\n(22)\\nAF11\\n(10)Best Queue\\nWorst QueueAF12\\n(12)AF13\\n(14)\\nFigure 18-11 Differentiated Services Assured Forwarding Values and Meaning\\nFor example, if you marked packets with all 12 values, those with AF11, AF12, and AF13 would all go into one queue; those with AF21, AF22, and AF23 would go into another queue; and so on. Inside the queue with all the AF2y traffic, you would treat the AF21, AF22, and AF23 each differently in regard to drop actions (congestion avoidance), with AF21 getting the preferred        treatment and AF23 the worst treatment.\\nClass Selector (CS)\\nOriginally, the ToS byte was defined          with a 3-bit   IP Precedence (IPP) field. When DiffServ redefined the ToS byte, it made sense to create eight DSCP values for backward compatibil-ity with IPP values. The Class Selector (CS) DSCP values are those settings.\\nFigure 18-12 shows the main idea along with the eight CS values, both in name and in deci-\\nmal value. Basically, the DSCP values have the same first 3 bits as the IPP field, and with binary 0s for the last 3 bits, as shown on the left side of the figure.

Network devices receive messages, make a forwarding decision, and then send the message—but sometimes the outgoing interface is busy. So, the device keeps the outgoing message in a queue, waiting for the outgoing interface to be available—simple enough.\\nThe term       congestion management (found in the QoS exam topics) refers to the QoS toolset \\nfor managing the queues that hold packets while they wait their turn to exit an interface \\n(and in other cases in which a router holds packets waiting for some resource). But conges-tion management refers to more than one idea, so you have to look inside devices to think about how they work. For instance, consider Figure 18-13, which shows the internals of a router. The router of course makes a forwarding decision, and it needs to be ready to queue packets for transmission once the outgoing interface is available. At the same time, the router may take a variety of other actions as well—ingress ACL, ingress NAT (on the inside interface), egress ACLs after the forwarding decision is made, and so on. \\ningress\\nservicesForwarding\\nReceiveRouter Internals\\negress\\nservicesOutput Queue\\nTransmit\\nFigure 18-13 Output Queuing in a Router: Last Output Action Before Transmission\\nThe figure shows output queuing, one        aspect of congestion management, in which the device holds messages until the output interface is available. The queuing system may use a single output queue, with a first-in,   first-out (FIFO) scheduler. (In other words, it’s like ordering lunch at the sandwich shop that has a single ordering line.)\\nNext, think a little more deeply about the queuing system. Most networking devices can \\nhave a queuing system with multiple queues. To use multiple queues, the queuing system needs a classifier function to choose which packets        are placed into which queue. (The clas-sifier can react to previously marked values, or do a more extensive match.) The queuing system needs a scheduler as well, to decide which message to take next when the interface becomes available, as shown in Figure 18-14.\\nClassifier\\nTransmitQueues Scheduler\\nFigure 18-14 Congestion Management (Queuing) Components\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  505\\nOf all these components of the queuing system, the scheduler can be the most interesting \\npart, because it can perform prioritization. Prioritization (yet another term from the exam topics) refers to the concept of giving priority to one queue        over another in some way. \\nRound Robin Scheduling (Prioritization)\\nOne scheduling algorithm        used by Cisco routers and switches uses round robin logic. In its most basic form, round robin cycles through the queues in order, taking turns with each queue. In each cycle, the scheduler either takes one message or takes a number of bytes from each queue by taking enough messages to total that number of bytes. Take some mes-sages from queue 1, move on and take some from queue 2, then take some from queue 3, and so on, starting back at queue 1 after finishing a complete pass through the queues.\\nRound robin scheduling also includes the concept of  weighting (generally called weighted \\nround robin). Basically, the scheduler takes a different number of packets (or bytes) from \\neach queue, giving more preference to one queue over another. \\nFor example, routers use a popular tool called   Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing \\n(CBWFQ) to guarantee a minimum amount of bandwidth to each class. That is, each class receives at least the amount of bandwidth configured during times of congestion, but maybe more. Internally, CBWFQ uses a weighted round robin scheduling algorithm, while letting the network engineer define the weightings as a percentage of link bandwidth. Figure 18-15 shows an example in which the three queues in the system have been given 20, 30, and 50 percent of the bandwidth each, respectively.\\nClassifier\\nTransmit20%\\n30%\\n50%Queues Scheduler\\nRound RobinQ1\\nQ2\\nQ3\\nFigure 18-15 CBWFQ Round Robin Scheduling\\nWith the queuing system shown in the figure, if the outgoing link is congested, the sched-\\nuler guarantees the percentage bandwidth shown in the        figure to each queue. That is, queue 1 gets 20 percent of the link even during busy times.\\nLow Latency Queuing\\nEarlier in the chapter, the section titled “Voice and Video Applications” discussed the reasons why voice and video, particularly interactive         voice and video like phone calls and videoconferencing, need low latency (low delay), low jitter, and low loss. Unfortunately, a round robin scheduler does not provide low enough delay, jitter, or loss. The solution: add Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) to the scheduler. \\nFirst, for a quick review, Table 18-3 lists the QoS requirements for a voice call. The numbers \\ncome from the Enterprise QoS Solution Reference Network Design Guide, referenced earlier in the chapter. The amount of bandwidth required per call varies based on the codec used by the call. However, the delay, jitter, and loss requirements remain the same for all voice calls. (Interactive video has similar requirements for delay, jitter, and loss.)\\nptg17396363506  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 18-3 QoS Requirements for a VoIP Call Per Cisco Voice Design Guide\\nBandwidth/call One-way Delay (max) Jitter (max) Loss (max)\\n30–320 Kbps 150 ms 30 ms <1%\\nA round robin queuing system adds too much delay for these voice and video packets. To \\nsee why, imagine a voice packet arrives and is routed to be sent out some interface with the queuing system shown in Figure 18-16. However, that next voice packet arrives just as the round robin scheduler moves on to service the queue labeled “data 1.” Even though the voice queue has been given 50 percent of the link bandwidth, the scheduler does not send that voice message until it sends some messages from the other three queues—adding delay and jitter.\\nClassifier\\nTransmit50%\\n15%10%\\n25%Queues Scheduler\\nRound Robinvoice\\ndata 1\\ndata 2\\ndefault \\nFigure 18-16 Round Robin Not Good for Voice Delay (Latency) and Jitter\\nThe solution, LLQ, tells the scheduler to treat one or more queues as special   priority \\nqueues. The LLQ scheduler always takes the next message from one of these special prior-ity queues. Problem solved: very little delay for packets in that queue, resulting in very little jitter as well. Plus the queue never has time to fill up, so there are no drops due to the queue         filling up. Figure 18-17 shows the addition of the LLQ logic for the voice queue.\\nClassifier\\nTransmitScheduler\\nLLQ—Always Next\\nRound Robindata 1\\ndata 2\\ndefault voice\\nFigure 18-17 LLQ Always Schedules Voice Packet Next\\nUsing LLQ, or a priority queue, provides the needed low delay, jitter, and loss for the traf-\\nfic in that queue. However, think about those other queues. Do you see the problem? What happens if the speed of the interface is X bits/second, but more than X bits/second come into the voice queue? The scheduler never services the other queues   (called queue starva-tion).\\nAs you might guess, there is a solution: limit the amount of traffic placed into the priority \\nqueue, using a feature called policing. The next section talks about policers in more detail, but for now, think of it as a cap on the bandwidth used by the priority queue. For instance, you could reserve 20 percent of the link’s bandwidth for the voice queue, and make it a \\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  507\\npriority queue. However, in this case, instead of 20 percent being the minimum bandwidth, \\nit is the maximum for that queue. If more than 20 percent of the link’s worth of bits shows up in that queue, the router will discard the excess.\\nLimiting the amount of bandwidth in the priority queue protects the other queues, but it \\ncauses yet another problem. Voice and video need low loss, and with LLQ, we put the voice and video into a priority queue that will discard the excess messages beyond the bandwidth limit. The solution? Find a way to limit the amount of voice and video that the network routes out this link, so that the policer never discards any of the traffic. There are QoS tools to help you do just that, called Call Admission Control (CAC) tools. However, CAC tools           did not get a mention in the exam topics, so this chapter leaves those tools at a brief men-tion. \\nA Prioritization Strategy for Data, Voice, and Video \\nThis section about queuing introduces several connected ideas, so before leaving the discus-sion of queuing, think about this strategy for how most        enterprises approach queuing in their QoS plans:\\n1. Use a round robin queuing method like CBWFQ for data classes and for noninterac-\\ntive voice and video.\\n2. If faced with too little bandwidth compared to the typical amount of traffic, give data\\nclasses that support business-critical applications much more guaranteed bandwidth\\nthan is given to less important data classes.\\n3. Use a priority queue with LLQ scheduling for interactive voice and video, to achieve\\nlow delay, jitter, and loss.\\n4. Put voice in a separate queue from video, so that the policing function applies sepa-rately to each.\\n5. Define enough bandwidth for each priority queue so that the built-in policer shouldnot discard any messages from the priority queues.\\n6. Use Call Admission Control (CAC) tools to avoid adding too much voice or video tothe network, which would trigger the policer function.\\nShaping and Policing\\nThis section introduces two related QoS tools, shaping and policing. These tools have a \\nmore specialized use, and are not found in as many locations in a typical enterprise. These tools are most often used at the WAN edge in an enterprise network design.\\nBoth policing and shaping monitor           the bit rate of the combined messages that flow through \\na device. Once enabled, the policer or shaper notes each packet that passes, and measures the number of bits per second over time. Both attempt to keep the bit rate at or below the configured speed, but by using two different actions: policers discard packets and shapers hold packets in queues to delay the packets.\\nptg17396363508  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nShapers and policers monitor the traffic rate (the bits/second that move through the shaper \\nor policer) versus a configured shaping rate or policing rate, respectively. The basic question that both ask is listed below, with the actions based on the answers:\\n1. Does this next packet push the measured rate past the configured shaping rate or\\npolicing rate?\\n2. If no:\\na. Let the packet keep moving through the normal path and do nothing extra to the\\npacket.\\n3. If yes:\\na. If shaping, delay the message by queuing it.\\nb. If policing, either discard the message or mark it differently.\\nThis section first explains policing, which discards or re-marks messages that exceed the policing rate, followed by shaping, which slows down messages that exceed the shaping rate.\\nPolicing\\nFocus on the traffic rate versus the configured policing rate for a moment, and the policing action of discarding messages. Those concepts      sit at the core of what the policing function does. \\nTraffic arrives at networking devices at a varying rate, with valleys and spikes. That is, if \\nyou graph the bit rate of the collective bits that enter or exit any interface, the graph would look something like the one on the left side of Figure 18-18. The policer would measure that rate, and make a similar measurement. Still on the left side of the figure, the horizontal dashed line represents  the policing rate, which is the rate configured for the policer. So, the policer has some awareness of the measured bit rate over time, which can be compared to the configured rate.\\nT=0 T=1 T=0 T=1Policing\\nRateIncoming Measured\\nTraffic RateOutgoing Measured\\nTraffic Rate\\nBurst\\nFigure 18-18 Effect of a Policer and Shaper on an Offered Traffic Load\\nThe right side of the figure shows a graph of what happens to the traffic when a policer dis-cards any messages that would have otherwise pushed the rate over the configured policing rate. In effect, the policer chops off the top of the graph      at the policing rate. \\nThe graph on the right also shows one example of a policer allowing a burst of traffic. \\nPolicers allow for a burst beyond the policing rate for a short time, after a period of low activity. So, that one peak that exceeds the policing rate on the graph on the right side allows for the nature of bursty data applications.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  509\\nWhere to Use Policing\\nNow that you understand the basics of policing, take a moment to ponder. Policers moni-\\ntor messages, measure a rate, and discard some messages. How does that help a network in regard to QoS? At first glance, it seems to hurt the network, discarding messages, many of which the transport or application layer will have to resend. How does that improve band-width, delay, jitter, or loss? \\nPolicing makes sense only in certain cases, and as a general tool, it can be best used      at the \\nedge between two networks. For instance, consider a typical point-to-point metro Ethernet WAN connection between two enterprise routers, R1 and R2. Usually, the enterprise net-work engineers just view the WAN as a cloud, with Ethernet interfaces on the routers, as shown at the top of Figure 18-19.\\nR1 R2\\n200 Mbps CIR\\nG0/1\\nPolice to\\n200 MbpsG0/2 SW SW R1 R2G0/1 G0/2\\nPolice to\\n200 Mbps\\nFigure 18-19 Ethernet WAN: Link Speed Versus CIR\\nNow think about the contract for this MetroE connection, as shown at the bottom of Figure 18-19. In this case, this connection uses Gigabit Ethernet for the access links, and a 200-Mbps committed information rate (CIR). That   is, the SP providing the WAN service \\nagrees to allow the enterprise to send 200 Mbps of traffic in each direction. However, as discussed back in Chapter 14, remember that the enterprise routers transmit the data at the speed of the access link, or 1 Gbps in this case. \\nThink like the SP for a moment, and think about supporting tens of thousands of Gigabit \\nEthernet links into your WAN service, all with 200-Mbps CIRs. What would happen if you just let all those customers send data that, over time, averaged close to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)? That is, if all customers kept sending data far beyond their contracted CIR, that much traffic could cause congestion in the WAN service. Also, those customers might choose to pay for a lower CIR, knowing that the SP would send the data anyway. And customers that were well behaved, and did not send more data than their CIR, might suffer from the congestion just as much as the customers that send far too much data.\\nFigure 18-19 also notes the solution to the problem: The SP can police incoming packets, \\nsetting the policing rate to match the CIR that the customer chooses for that link. By doing so, the SP protects all customers from the negative effects of the customers that send too much traffic. Customers receive what they paid for. And the SP can provide reports of actu-al traffic rates, so the enterprise knows when to buy a faster CIR for each link.\\nPolicers can discard excess traffic, but      they can also re-mark packets as well. Think again \\nabout what an SP does with an ingress policer as shown in Figure 18-19: they are discarding their customer’s messages. So, the SP might want to make a compromise that works better \\nptg17396363510  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nfor its customers, while still protecting the SP’s network. The SP could mark the messages \\nwith a new marking value, with this strategy:\\n1. Re-mark packets that exceed the policing rate, but let them into the SP’s network.\\n2. If other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when they process the pack-\\net, the different marking means that device can discard the packet. However…\\n3. …if no other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when forwarding that \\nre-marked packet, it gets through the SP network anyway.\\nWith this strategy, the SP can treat their customers a little better by discarding less traffic, \\nwhile still protecting the SP’s network      during times of stress.\\nSummarizing the key      features of policing:\\n■It measures the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured policing rate.\\n■It allows for a burst of data after a period of inactivity.\\n■It is enabled on an interface, in either direction, but typically at ingress.\\n■It can discard excess messages, but can also re-mark the message so that it is a candidate\\nfor more aggressive discard later in its journey.\\nShaping\\nYou have a 1-Gbps link from      a router into an SP, but a 200-Mbps CIR for traffic to another \\nsite, as seen in Figure 18-19. The SP has told you that they always discard incoming traffic that exceeds the CIR. The solution? Use a shaper to slow the traffic down, in this case to a 200-Mbps shaping rate.\\nThat scenario—shaping before sending data to an SP that is policing—is one of the typical \\nuses of a shaper. Shapers can be useful in other cases as well, but generally speaking, shapers make sense when a device can send at a certain speed, but there is a benefit to slowing down the rate.\\nThe shaper slows messages      down by queuing the messages. The shaper then services the \\nshaping queues, but not based on when the physical interface is available. Instead, the shaper schedules messages from the shaping queues based on the  shaping rate, as shown in Figure 18-20. Following the left-to-right flow in the figure, for a router, the packet is routed out an interface; the shaper queues packets so that the sending rate through the shaper does not exceed the shaping rate; and then output queuing works as normal, if needed.\\nNote that in some cases, the output queuing function has little to do. For instance, in the \\nearlier example shown in Figure 18-19, the SP is policing incoming messages at 200 Mbps. If the router (R1 for instance) were to shape all traffic exiting toward the SP to 200 Mbps as well, with that 1-Gbps interface, the output queue would seldom if ever be congested.\\nBecause shapers create queues where messages wait, you should apply a congestion man-\\nagement tool to those queues. It is perfectly normal to apply the round robin and priority queuing features of CBWFQ and LLQ, respectively, to the      shaping queues, as noted in the figure.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  511\\nTransmit\\nCBWFQAt\\nShapeRateLLQRouter Internals\\nForwardingShaper\\nR1Output\\nQueuing\\nFigure 18-20 Shaping Queues: Scheduling with LLQ and CBWFQ\\nSetting a Good Shaping Time Interval for Voice and Video\\nOnce again, a QoS tool has attempted to solve one QoS problem, but introduces another. \\nThe unfortunate side effect of a shaper is that is slows down packets, which then creates more delay, and probably more jitter. The delay occurs in part because of the message sim-ply waiting in a queue, but partly because of the mechanisms used by a shaper. Thankfully, you can (and should) configure a shaper’s setting that changes the internal operation of the shaper, which then reduces the delay and jitter caused to voice and video traffic.\\nA shaper’s time interval refers       to its internal logic and how a shaper averages, over time, \\nsending at a particular rate. A shaper basically sends as fast as it can, and then waits; sends and waits; sends and waits. For instance, the policing and shaping example in this section suggests shaping at 200 Mbps on a router that has a 1000-Mbps (1-Gbps) outgoing inter-face. In that case, the shaper would result in the interface sending data 20 percent of the time, and being silent 80 percent of the time.\\nFigure 18-21 shows a graph of the shaping time interval concept, assuming a time interval \\nof 1 second. To average 200 million bits/second, the shaper would allow 200 million bits to exit its shaping queues and exit the interface each second. Because the interface trans-mits bits at 1 Gbps, it takes just .2 seconds, or 200 ms, to send all 200 million bits. Then the shaper must wait for the rest of the time interval, another 800 ms, before beginning the next time interval. \\nSend:\\n200 ms\\nT= 0 T= 1 sec T= 2 sec1 Gbps\\nWait: 800 ms Wait: 800 ms200 \\nMillion\\nBits\\nSentSend:\\n200 ms\\n1 Second Time Interval200 \\nMillion\\nBits\\nSent\\nFigure 18-21 1 Second (1000 ms) Shaping Time Interval, Shaping at 20% of Line Rate\\nNow think about a voice or video packet that needs very low delay and jitter—and unfortu-nately, it arrives just as the shaper finishes sending data for a time interval. Even if that voice \\nptg17396363512  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nor video packet is in a priority shaping queue, the packet will wait 800 ms before the shaper \\nschedules the next packet—far too long compared to the 150-ms one-way delay goal for voice.\\nThe solution to this problem: configure a short time interval. For example, consider the fol-\\nlowing time intervals (abbreviated Tc), and their effects, for this same example (1-Gbps link, shaping to 200 Mbps), but with shorter and shorter time intervals:\\nTc = 1 second (1000 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 200 ms, rest for 800 ms\\nTc = .1 second (100 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 20 ms, rest for 80 msTc = .01 second (10 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 2 ms, rest for 8 ms\\nWhen shaping, use a short time interval. By recommendation, use a 10-ms time interval to \\nsupport voice and video. With that setting, a voice or video packet should wait no more than 10 ms while waiting for the next shaping time interval, at which         point the priority queue scheduling should take all the voice and video messages next.\\nSummarizing the key features      of shapers:\\n■Shapers measure the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured shaping rate.\\n■Shapers allow for bursting after a period of inactivity.\\n■Shapers are enabled on an interface for egress (outgoing packets).\\n■Shapers slow down packets by queuing them, and over time releasing them from the\\nqueue at the shaping rate.\\n■Shapers use queuing tools to create and schedule the shaping queues, which is very\\nimportant for the same reasons discussed for output queuing.\\nCongestion Avoidance\\nThe QoS feature called      congestion avoidance attempts to reduce overall packet loss by pre-\\nemptively discarding some packets used in TCP connections. To see how it works, you first need to look at how TCP works in regard to windowing, and then look at how congestion avoidance features work.\\nTCP Windowing Basics\\nTCP uses a flow control       mechanism called windowing. Each TCP receiver grants a window \\nto the sender. The window, which is a number, defines the number of bytes the sender can send over the TCP connection before receiving a TCP acknowledgement for at least some of those bytes. More exactly, the window size is the number of unacknowledged bytes that the sender can send before the sender must simply stop and wait. \\nThe TCP window mechanism gives the receiver control of the sender’s rate of sending data. \\nEach new segment sent by the receiver back to the sender grants a new window, which can be smaller or larger than the previous window. By raising and lowering the window, the receiver can make the sender wait more or wait less.\\nptg1739636318Chapter 18: Quality of Service (QoS)  513\\nNOTE Each TCP connection has two senders and two receivers; that is, each host sends \\nand receives data. For this discussion, focus on one direction, with one host as the sender and the other as the receiver. If calling one host the “sender” and one the “receiver,” note that the receiver then acknowledges data in TCP segments sent back to the sender by the receiver.\\nBy choice, when all is well, the receiver keeps increasing the granted window, doubling it every time the receiver acknowledges data. Eventually, the window grows to the point that the sender never has to stop sending: the sender keeps receiving TCP acknowledgements before sending all the data in the previous window. Each new acknowledgement (as listed in a TCP segment and TCP header) grants a new window to the sender.\\nAlso by choice, when a TCP receiver senses the loss of a TCP segment, he shrinks the win-\\ndow with the next window size listed in the next TCP segment the receiver sends back to the sender. For each TCP segment lost, the window can shrink by one-half, with multiple segment losses causing the window to shrink by half multiple times, slowing down the sender’s rate significantly.\\nNow think about router queues for a moment. Without a congestion avoidance tool, an \\nevent called  a tail drop causes the most drops in a network. Figure 18-22 shows the idea, showing the same queuing system, but in three separate conditions: little congestion, medium congestion, and much congestion. On the left, with little congestion, the output queues on an interface have not yet filled. In the middle, the queues have started to fill, with one queue being totally full. Any new packets that arrive for that queue       right now will be dropped because there is no room at the tail of the queue (tail drop).\\n1 2 3\\nTail Drop Tail DropLittle Congestion Medium Congestion Much Congestion\\nFigure 18-22 Stable TCP Window: Acknowledgement Received Before Window Expires\\nThe worse the congestion in the queues, the more likely tail drop will occur, as shown with the most congested case on the right side of the figure. The more congestion, the bigger the negative impact on traffic—both in terms of loss       and in terms of increasing delay in TCP connections. \\nCongestion Avoidance Tools\\nCongestion avoidance tools attempt      to avoid the congestion, primarily through using TCP’s own windowing mechanisms. These tools discard some TCP segments before the queues fill, hoping that enough TCP connections will slow down, reducing congestion, and avoid-ing a much worse problem: the effects of many more packets being dropped due to tail \\nptg17396363514  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ndrop. The strategy is simple: discard some now in hopes that the device discards far fewer in \\nthe long term.\\nCongestion avoidance tools monitor the average queue depth over time, triggering more \\nsevere actions the deeper the queue, as shown in Figure 18-23. The height of the box rep-resents the queue depth, or the number of packets in the queue. When the queue depth is low, below the minimum threshold values, the congestion avoidance tool does nothing. When the queue depth is between the minimum and maximum thresholds, the congestion avoidance tool discards a percentage of the packets—usually a small percentage, like 5, 10, or 20 percent. If the queue depth passes the maximum threshold, the tool drops all packets, in an action  called full drop.\\nFull DropsQueue Full\\n% Drops\\nNo DropsMaximum Threshold\\nMinimum Threshold\\nQueue Empty\\nFigure 18-23 Mechanisms of Congestion Avoidance\\nOf course, like all the QoS tools mentioned in this chapter, congestion avoidance tools can classify messages to treat some packets better than others. In the same queue, packets with one marking might be dropped more aggressively, and those      with better DSCP markings dropped less aggressively. \\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

These types of labs include a larger set of topics, and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.)\\nConfig Labs:  In your idle moments, review and repeat any of the Config Labs for this \\nbook part in the author’s blog; launch from http://blog.certskills.com/ccna and navigate to \\nHands-On > Config Lab .\\nOther:  If using other lab tools, here are a few suggestions: When building ACL labs, you \\ncan test with Telnet (port 23), SSH (port 22), ping (ICMP), and traceroute (UDP) traffic as generated from an extra router. So, do not just configure the ACL; make an ACL that can match these types of traffic, denying some and permitting others, and then test. \\nptg17396363Part V completes this book’s many chapters focused on IPv4 routing and related topics. Part \\nII shows how to learn routes with various IPv4 routing protocols. Part III discusses WAN options and how to route IP packets over those WANs. Part IV discusses services over IPv4 networks, both to secure the network with ACLs and to improve the quality of user experi-ence with QoS. Part V wraps up the parts focused on IPv4 routing with a couple of specific topics centered on the edge of the LAN, topping it off with an IPv4 troubleshooting discus-sion.\\nThis part begins by drilling down into the device and configuration options for routing \\nbetween LAN-based subnets. Those options include routers and Layer 3 switches, with a variety of configuration variations. This chapter works through all those variations, through to the point of troubleshooting each.\\nThis part’s second chapter (20) looks at a related topic: how to make the default gateway \\n(router) function have redundancy for better availability. So, while Chapter 19 shows the various ways to configure routers to have an address connected to a LAN subnet, Chapter 20 then shows how multiple routers connected to the same subnet can cooperate to pro-vide redundancy and better availability through a protocol: Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP).\\nEvery topic related to IPv4 routing in this book has some troubleshooting aspect to learn \\nper the current exam topics. To that end, this part’s final chapter (21) caps this book’s IPv4 routing discussions with a chapter devoted to IPv4 troubleshooting. Many of the earlier chapters in this book already discussed troubleshooting of the content in that same chapter or part. Chapter 21 reviews some of the basics that you may not have thought about since your ICND1 studies, and serves as a great review before moving on to Part VI, which is about IPv6.\\nptg17396363Part V\\nIPv4 Routing and Troubleshooting\\nChapter 19:  IPv4 Routing in the LAN\\nChapter 20:  Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing\\nChapter 21:  Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing\\nPart V Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 19\\nIPv4 Routing in the LAN\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n1.0 LAN Switching Technologies\\n1.5 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot (Layer 2/Layer 3) EtherChannel\\n1.5.a Static\\n1.5.b PaGP1.5.b LACP\\n2.0 Routing Technologies\\n2.1 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot Inter-VLAN routing\\n2.1.a Router on a stick\\n2.1.b SVI\\n5.0 Infrastructure Maintenance\\n5.6 Troubleshoot basic Layer 3 end-to-end connectivity issues\\nThe CCNA Routing and Switching certification features two technology topics: routing and \\nswitching. This chapter focuses on routing, and one specific part of the routing space: rout-ing between LAN subnets. This chapter focuses on configuration options on routers and Layer 3 switches that enable them to route packets between subnets that exist on VLANs.\\nThis chapter breaks the discussion down into three major sections. The first section focuses \\non using routers to route between VLANs, with a feature many of you will remember from the ICND1 Cert Guide: routing over a VLAN trunk, also known as   router-on-a-stick (ROAS). This option gives a router the means to connect to a switch with one Ethernet link, use trunking, and route packets that come in that trunk on one VLAN and go right back out that same trunk but tagged with another VLAN.\\nThe second and third sections focuses on implementing Layer 3 switching, but with two \\nmajor configuration options. The second section discusses using    switched virtual inter-faces (SVI) on switches, which are VLAN interfaces. (This is another topic with overlap in the ICND1 book and the ICND1 100-105 exam.) The third major section of the chapter discusses an alternative to SVIs called routed ports, in which the physical switch ports are made to act like interfaces on a router. This third section also introduces the concept of an EtherChannel as used as a routed port in a feature called Layer 3 EtherChannel.\\nptg17396363“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help \\nyou decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

To route IP packets in and out of those VLANs, \\nsome devices (either routers or Layer 3 switches) need to have an IP address in each subnet and have a connected route to each of those subnets. Then the IP addresses on those rout-ers or Layer 3 switches can serve as the default gateways in those subnets.\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  523\\nThis chapter breaks down the   LAN routing options into four categories: \\n■Use a router, with one router LAN interface and cable connected to the switch for each\\nand every VLAN (typically not used)\\n■Use a router, with a VLAN trunk connecting to a LAN switch (known as router-on-a-\\nstick, or ROAS)\\n■Use a Layer 3 switch with switched virtual interfaces (SVI)\\n■Use a Layer 3 switch with routed interfaces (which may or may not be Layer 3\\nEtherChannels)\\nOf the items in the list, the first option works, but to be practical it requires far too many \\ninterfaces. It is mentioned here only to make the list complete.\\nAs for the other three options, this chapter discusses each in turn as the main focus of one \\nof the three major sections in this chapter. Each feature is used in real networks today, with the choice to use one or the other driven by the design and needs for a particular part of the network. Figure 19-1 shows cases in which these options could be used. \\n2 VLANs\\nLayer 3\\nSwitchesVLAN Trunking\\n12 VLANsB1\\nCore2 VLANs\\nB2\\n2 VLANs\\nB3SW1\\nDA\\nBCSW2\\nSW3\\nFigure 19-1 Layer 3 Switching at the Central Site\\nFigure 19-1 shows a classic case for using a router with a VLAN trunk at the branches on \\nthe right, and either of the two options in Layer 3 switches at the central site on the left. The figure shows a central site campus LAN on the left, with 12 VLANs. At the central site, two of the switches act as Layer 3 switches, combining the functions of a router and a switch, routing between all 12 subnets/VLANs. Those Layer 3 switches could configure routing using SVIs, routed interfaces, or both. Additionally, sites that have a WAN router and a switch, like the remote branch sites on the right side of the figure, might use ROAS to take advantage of the router’s ability to route over an 802.1Q trunk.\\nNote that Figure 19-1 just shows an example. The engineer could use Layer 3 switching at \\neach site, or routers with VLAN trunking at each site. \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A, F 2 B, C 3 C 4 C, D 5 A, C 6 B, C \\nptg17396363524  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nConfiguring ROAS\\nThis next topic discusses how routers route packets to subnets associated with VLANs con-\\nnected to a router 802.1Q trunk. That long description can be a bit of a chore to repeat each time someone wants to discuss this feature, so over time, the networking world has instead settled on a shorter and more interesting     name for this feature: router-on-a-stick (ROAS).\\nROAS uses router VLAN trunking configuration     to give the router a logical router inter-\\nface connected to each VLAN, and therefore each subnet that sits on a separate VLAN. That trunking configuration revolves around subinterfaces. The router needs to have an IP address/mask associated with each VLAN on the trunk. However, the router has only one physical interface on which to configure the ip address command. Cisco solves this prob-lem by creating multiple virtual router interfaces, one associated with each VLAN on that trunk (at least for each VLAN that you want the trunk to support). Cisco calls these virtual interfaces   subinterfaces.\\nThe ROAS configuration      creates a subinterface for each VLAN on the trunk, and the router then treats all frames tagged with that associated VLAN ID as if they came in or out of that subinterface. Figure 19-2 shows the concept with Router B1, one of the branch routers from Figure 19-1. Because this router needs to route between only two VLANs, the figure also shows two subinterfaces, named G0/0.10 and G0/0.20, which create a new place in the configuration where the per-VLAN configuration settings can be made. The router treats frames tagged with VLAN 10 as if they came in or out of G0/0.10, and frames tagged with    VLAN 20 as if they came in or out G0/0.20.\\n10.1.20.1/2410.1.10.1/24\\nInterface G0/0.10\\nInterface G0/0.20\\nVLAN 20VLAN 10\\n20 10 20 10 20\\nSW1 B1\\nFigure 19-2 Subinterfaces on Router B1\\nIn addition, note that most Cisco routers do not attempt to negotiate trunking, so both the \\nrouter and switch need to manually configure trunking. This chapter discusses the router side of that trunking configuration; the matching switch interface would need to be config-ured with the   switchport mode trunk command.\\nExample 19-1 shows a full example of the      802.1Q trunking configuration required on Router B1 in Figure 19-2. More generally, these steps detail how to configure 802.1Q trunking on a router:\\nStep 1. Use the interface type number.subint command in global configuration mode \\nto create a unique subinterface for each VLAN that needs to be routed.\\nStep 2. Use the encapsulation dot1q vlan_id command in subinterface configuration \\nmode to enable 802.1Q and associate one specific VLAN with the subinter-\\nface. \\nStep 3. Use the ip address address mask command in subinterface configuration \\nmode to configure IP settings (address and mask).Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  525\\nExample 19-1 Router Configuration for the 802.1Q Encapsulation Shown in \\nFigure 19-2\\nB1# show running-config\\n!

The subinterface number begins with the period, \\nlike .10 and .20 in this case. These numbers can be any number from 1 up through a very large number (over 4 billion). The number just needs to be unique among all subinterfaces associated with this one physical interface. In fact, the subinterface number does not even have to match the associated VLAN ID. (The encapsulation command, and       not the subinter-face number, defines the VLAN ID associated with the subinterface.)\\nNOTE Although not required, most sites do choose to make the subinterface number match the VLAN ID, as shown in Example 19-1, just to avoid confusion.\\nEach subinterface configuration lists two subcommands. One command ( encapsulation) \\nenables trunking and defines the VLAN whose frames are considered to be coming in and out of the subinterface. The ip address command     works the same way it does on any other interface. Note that if the physical Ethernet interface reaches an up/up state, the subinter-face should as well, which would then let the router add the connected     routes shown at the bottom of the example.\\nNow that the router has a working interface, with IPv4 addresses configured, the router can \\nroute IPv4 packets on these subinterfaces. That is, the router treats these subinterfaces like any physical interface in terms of adding connected routes, matching those routes, and for-warding packets to/from those connected subnets.\\nNOTE As a brief aside, while Example 19-1 shows 802.1Q configuration, the Inter-Switch Link (ISL) configuration     on the same router would be practically identical. Just substitute the keyword isl instead of dot1q in each case.\\nThe configuration and use of the native VLAN on the trunk requires a little extra thought. The native VLAN can be configured       on a subinterface, or on the physical interface, or ignored as in Example 19-1. Each 802.1Q trunk has one native VLAN, and if the router needs to route packets for a subnet that exists in the native VLAN, then the router needs \\nptg17396363526  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nsome configuration to support that subnet. The two options to define a router interface for \\nthe native VLAN are\\n■Configure the ip address command on the physical interface, but without an\\nencapsulation command; the router considers this physical interface to be using the\\nnative VLAN.\\n■Configure the ip address command on a subinterface, and use the encapsulation dot1q\\nvlan-id native subcommand to tell the router both the VLAN ID and the fact that it isthe native VLAN.\\nExample 19-2 shows both native VLAN configuration options with a small change to the \\nsame configuration in Example 19-1. In this case, VLAN 10 becomes the native VLAN. The top part of the example shows the option to configure the router physical interface to use native VLAN 10. The second half of the example shows how to configure that same native VLAN on a subinterface. In both cases, the switch configuration also needs to be changed       to make VLAN 10 the native VLAN.\\nExample 19-2 Router Configuration Using Native VLAN 10 on Router B1\\n! First option: put the native VLAN IP address on the physical interface\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.20 encapsulation dot1q 20\\n ip address 10.1.20.1 255.255.255.0\\n! Second option: like Example 19-1, but add the native keyword\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.10\\n encapsulation dot1q 10 native\\n ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0.20\\n encapsulation dot1q 20\\n ip address 10.1.20.1 255.255.255.0\\nVerifying ROAS\\nBeyond using the show running-config command, ROAS configuration      on a router can be \\nbest verified with two commands: show ip route [connected] and show vlans. As with any router interface, as long as the interface is in an up/up state, and has an IPv4 address con-figured, IOS will put a connected (and local) route in the IPv4 routing table. So, a first and obvious check would be to see if all the expected connected routes exist. Example 19-3 lists the connected routes per the configuration   shown in Example 19-1. \\nExample 19-3 Connected Routes Based on Example 19-1 Configuration\\nB1# show ip route connected\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\n!

In particular, the subinterface state cannot be better than the state of the matching physical interface. For instance, on Router B1 in the examples so far, physical interface G0/0 is in an up/up state, and the subinterfaces are in an up/up state. But if you unplugged the cable from that port, the physical port would fail to a down/down state, and the subinterfaces would also fail to a down/down state. Example 19-4 shows another example, with the physical interface being shut down, with the subin-terfaces then automatically          changed to an administratively down state as a result.\\nExample 19-4 Subinterface State Tied to Physical Interface State\\nB1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nB1(config)# interface g0/0\\nB1(config-if)# shutdown\\nB1(config-if)# ^ZB1# show ip interface brief | include 0/0\\nGigabitEthernet0/0         unassigned YES manual administratively down down    \\nGigabitEthernet0/0.10 10.1.10.1 YES manual administratively down down    \\nGigabitEthernet0/0.20 10.1.20.1 YES manual administratively down down    \\nAdditionally, the subinterface state can also be enabled and disabled independently from \\nthe physical interface, using the     no shutdown and shutdown commands in subinterface \\nconfiguration mode. \\nAnother useful ROAS verification command, show vlans, spells     out which router trunk \\ninterfaces use which VLANs, which VLAN is the native VLAN, plus some packet statistics. The fact that the packet counters are increasing can be useful when verifying whether traf-fic is happening or not. Example 19-5 shows a sample, based on the Router B1 configura-tion in Example 19-2 (bottom half), in which native VLAN 10 is configured on subinterface G0/0.10. Note that the output identifies VLAN 1 associated with the physical interface, VLAN 10 as the native VLAN associated with G0/0.10, and VLAN 20 associated with G0/0.20. It also lists the IP addresses assigned      to each interface/subinterface.\\nExample 19-5 Sample show vlans Command to Match Sample Router Trunking\\nConfiguration\\nR1# show vlans\\nVirtual LAN ID:  1 (IEEE 802.1Q Encapsulation)\\n   vLAN Trunk Interface:   GigabitEthernet0/0\\n   Protocols Configured:   Address: Received: Transmitted:\\nOther 0 83\\nptg17396363528  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n   69 packets, 20914 bytes input\\n   147 packets, 11841 bytes output\\nVirtual LAN ID:  10 (IEEE 802.1Q Encapsulation)\\n   vLAN Trunk Interface:   GigabitEthernet0/0.10\\n This is configured as native Vlan for the following interface(s) :\\nGigabitEthernet0/0        Native-vlan Tx-type: Untagged\\n   Protocols Configured:   Address: Received: Transmitted:\\nIP 10.1.10.1 2 3\\nOther 0 1\\n   3 packets, 722 bytes input\\n   4 packets, 264 bytes output\\nVirtual LAN ID:  20 (IEEE 802.1Q Encapsulation)\\n   vLAN Trunk Interface:   GigabitEthernet0/0.20\\n   Protocols Configured:   Address: Received: Transmitted:\\nIP 10.1.20.1 0 134\\nOther 0 1\\n   0 packets, 0 bytes input\\n   135 packets, 10498 bytes output\\nTroubleshooting ROAS\\nThe biggest challenge when troubleshooting ROAS      has to do with the fact that if you mis-\\nconfigure only the router, or misconfigure only the switch, the other device on the trunk has no way to know that the other side is misconfigured. That is, if you check the show \\nip route and show vlans commands on a router, and the output looks like it matches the intended configuration, and the connected routes for the correct subinterfaces show up, routing may still fail because of problems on the attached switch. So troubleshooting ROAS often begins with checking the configuration on both the router and switch, because there is no status output on either device that tells you where the problem might be.\\nFirst, to check ROAS on the router, you need to start with the intended configuration, and \\nask questions about the configuration:\\n1. Is each non-native VLAN configured on the router with an encapsulation dot1q\\nvlan-id command on a subinterface?\\n2. Do those same VLANs exist on the trunk on the neighboring switch (show interfaces\\ntrunk), and are they in the allowed list, not VTP pruned, and not STP blocked?\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  529\\n3. Does each router ROAS subinterface have an IP address/mask configured per the\\nplanned configuration?\\n4. If using the native VLAN, is it configured correctly on the router either on a subinter-\\nface (with an encapsulation dot1q vlan-id native command) or implied on the physi-\\ncal interface?\\n5. Is the same native VLAN configured on the neighboring switch’s trunk?\\n6. Are the router physical or ROAS subinterfaces configured with a shutdown\\ncommand?\\nFor some of these steps, you need to be ready to repeat all the VLAN and VLAN trunk \\ntroubleshooting as discussed back in the “Troubleshooting VLANs and VLAN Trunks” sec-tion of Chapter 4, “LAN Troubleshooting.” The reason is that on many Cisco routers, router interfaces do not negotiate trunking. As a result, if the switch has any problems with VLANs or the VLAN trunking configuration on its side of the trunk, the router has no way to real-ize that the problem exists. \\nFor example, imagine you configured ROAS on a router just like in Example 19-1 or \\nExample 19-2. However, the switch on the other end of the link had no matching configu-ration. For instance, maybe the switch did not even define VLANs 10 and 20. Maybe the switch did not configure trunking on the port connected to the router. Even with blatant misconfiguration or missing configuration on the switch, the router still shows up/up ROAS interfaces and subinterfaces, IP routes in the output of show ip route, and meaningful con-figuration      information in the output of the show vlans command.\\nVLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch SVIs\\nUsing a router with ROAS to route packets makes sense in some cases, particularly at small remote sites. In sites with a larger LAN, network designers choose to use Layer 3 switches for most inter-VLAN routing.\\nA Layer 3 switch (also called a  multilayer switch) is one device, but it executes logic at two \\nlayers: Layer 2 LAN switching and Layer 3 IP routing. The Layer 2 switch function forwards frames inside each VLAN, but it will not forward frames between VLANs. The Layer 3 for-warding (routing) logic forwards IP packets between VLANs.\\nLayer 3 switches typically support two configuration options to enable IPv4 routing inside \\nthe switch, specifically to enable IPv4 on switch interfaces. This section explains one option, an option that uses switched virtual interfaces    (SVI). The final major section of the chapter deals with the other option for configuring IPv4 addresses on Layer 3 switches: routed interfaces. \\nConfiguring Routing Using Switch SVIs\\nThe configuration of a Layer 3 switch mostly       looks like the Layer 2 switching configura-tion shown back in Part I of this book, with a small bit of configuration added for the Layer 3 functions. The Layer 3 switching function needs a virtual interface connected to each VLAN internal to the switch. These VLAN interfaces act   like router interfaces, with an IP address and mask. The Layer 3 switch has an IP routing table, with connected routes off each of these VLAN interfaces. (These interfaces are also referred to as switched virtual interfaces [SVI].)\\nptg17396363530  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo show the concept of Layer 3 switching with SVIs, Figure 19-3 shows the design changes \\nand configuration concept for the same branch office used in Figures 19-1 and 19-2. The figure shows the Layer 3 switch function with a router icon inside the switch, to emphasize that the switch routes the packets. The branch still has two user VLANs, so the Layer 3 switch needs one VLAN interface for each VLAN. In addition, the traffic still needs to get to the router to access the WAN, so the switch uses a third VLAN (VLAN 30 in this case) for the link to Router B1. This link would not be a trunk, but would be an access link.\\nVLAN 20interface vlan 20\\n10.1.20.1/24interface vlan 10\\n10.1.10.1/24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 30\\ninterface vlan 3010.1.30.1/24 G0/010.1.30.2\\nB1The Middle Box Represents the Layer 3 Switch,\\nwith Internal Logic Visible\\nG0/1F0/1\\nF0/2\\nF0/3\\nF0/4\\nFigure 19-3 Routing on VLAN Interfaces in a Layer 3 Switch\\nThe following steps show how to configure Layer 3 switching using SVIs. Note that on \\nsome switches, like the 2960 and 2960-XR switches used for the examples in this book, the ability to route IPv4 packets must be enabled first, with a reload of the switch required to enable the feature. The rest of the steps after Step 1 would apply to all models of Cisco       switches that are capable of doing Layer 3 switching.\\nStep 1. Enable IP routing on the switch, as needed:\\nA. Use the sdm prefer lanbase-routing command (or similar) in global con-\\nfiguration mode to change the switch forwarding ASIC settings to make \\nspace for IPv4 routes at the next reload of the switch.\\nB. Use the reload EXEC command in enable mode to reload (reboot) the \\nswitch to pick up the new sdm prefer command setting. \\nC. Once reloaded, use the ip routing command in global configuration \\nmode to enable the IPv4 routing function in IOS software and to enable key commands like show ip route.\\nStep 2. Configure each SVI interface, one per VLAN for which routing should be \\ndone by this Layer 3 switch:\\nA. Use the interface vlan vlan_id command in global configuration mode \\nto create a VLAN interface, and to give the switch’s routing logic a Layer 3 interface connected into the VLAN of the same number. \\nB. Use the ip address address mask command in VLAN interface configu-\\nration mode to configure an IP address and mask on the VLAN inter-face, enabling IPv4 routing on that VLAN interface.\\nC. (As needed) Use the no shutdown command in interface configuration \\nmode to enable the VLAN interface (if it is currently in a shutdown state). Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  531\\nExample 19-6 shows the configuration to match Figure 19-3. In this case, switch SW1, \\na 2960, has already used the sdm prefer lanbase-routing global command and has been reloaded. The example shows the related configuration on all three VLAN       interfaces.\\nExample 19-6 VLAN Interface Configuration for Layer 3 Switching\\nip routing\\n!\\ninterface vlan 10\\n ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0\\n!interface vlan 20\\n ip address 10.1.20.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface vlan 30 ip address 10.1.30.1 255.255.255.0\\nVerifying Routing with SVIs\\nWith the VLAN configuration       shown in the previous section, the switch is ready to route \\npackets between the VLANs as shown in Figure 19-3. To support the routing of packets, the switch adds connected IP routes, as shown in Example 19-7; note that each route is listed as being connected to a different VLAN interface.\\nExample 19-7 Connected Routes on a Layer 3 Switch\\nSW1# show ip route\\n! legend omitted for brevity\\n10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 6 subnets, 2 masks\\nC 10.1.10.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan10L 10.1.10.1/32 is directly connected, Vlan10\\nC 10.1.20.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan20\\nL 10.1.20.1/32 is directly connected, Vlan20\\nC 10.1.30.0/24 is directly connected, Vlan30L 10.1.30.1/32 is directly connected, Vlan30\\nThe switch would also need additional routes to the rest of the network (not shown in the \\nfigures in this chapter). The Layer 3 switch could use static routes or a routing protocol, depending on the capabilities of the switch. For instance, if you then enabled EIGRP on the Layer 3 switch, the configuration and verification would work the same as it does on a router, as discussed in Chapter 9, “Understanding EIGRP Concepts,” and Chapter 10, “Implementing EIGRP for IPv4.” The routes that IOS adds to the Layer 3 switch’s IP routing table       would list the VLAN interfaces as outgoing interfaces.\\nNOTE Some models of Cisco enterprise switches, based on model, IOS version, and IOS feature set, support different capabilities for IP routing and routing protocols, so for real networks, check the capabilities of the switch model by browsing at Cisco.com. In particu-lar, check the    Cisco Feature Navigator (CFN) tool at http://www.cisco.com/go/cfn.\\nptg17396363532  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTroubleshooting Routing with SVIs\\nThere are two big topics to investigate       when troubleshooting routing over LANs with SVIs. \\nFirst, you have to make sure the switch has been enabled to support IP routing. Second, the VLAN associated with each VLAN interface must be known and active on the local switch, otherwise the VLAN interfaces do not come up.\\nFirst, about enabling IP routing, note that some models of Cisco switches default to enable \\nLayer 3 switching, and some do not. So, to make sure your switch supports Layer 3 routing, look to those first few configuration commands listed in the configuration checklist found in the earlier section “Configuring Routing Using Switch SVIs.” Those commands are sdm prefer (followed by a reload) and then ip routing (after the reload). \\nThe sdm prefer command   changes how the switch forwarding chips allocate memory for \\ndifferent forwarding tables, and changes to those tables requires a reload of the switch. By \\ndefault, many access switches that support Layer 3 switching still have an SDM default that does not allocate space for an IP routing table. Once changed and reloaded, the ip routing \\ncommand then enables IPv4 routing in IOS software. Both are necessary before some Cisco switches will act as a Layer 3 switch.\\nExample 19-8 shows some symptoms on a router for which Layer 3 switching had not yet \\nbeen enabled by the sdm prefer command. As you can see, both the show ip route EXEC command and the ip routing config command are rejected because they do not exist to IOS until the sdm prefer command has been used (followed by a reload of the switch). \\nExample 19-8 Evidence That a Switch Has Not Yet Enabled IPv4 Routing\\nSW1# show ip route\\n^\\n% Invalid input detected at \\'^\\' marker.\\nSW3# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nSW3(config)# ip routing\\n^\\n% Invalid input detected at \\'^\\' marker.\\nThe second big area to investigate when troubleshooting SVIs relates to the SVI state, a \\nstate that ties to the state of the associated VLANs. Each VLAN interface has a matching VLAN of the same number, and the VLAN interface’s state is tied to the state       of the VLAN in certain ways. In particular, for a VLAN interface to be in an up/up state:\\nStep 1. The VLAN must be defined on the local switch (either explicitly, or learned \\nwith VTP).\\nStep 2. The switch must have at least one up/up interface using the VLAN, \\neither/both:\\nA. An up/up access interface assigned to that VLAN\\nB. A trunk interface for which the VLAN is in the allowed list, is STP for-\\nwarding, and is not VTP pruned\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  533\\nStep 3. The VLAN (not the VLAN interface) must be administratively enabled (that is, \\nnot shutdown).\\nStep 4. The VLAN interface (not the VLAN) must be administratively enabled (that is, \\nnot shutdown).\\nWhen working through the steps in the list, keep in mind that the VLAN and the VLAN \\ninterface are related but separate ideas, and the configuration items are separate in the CLI. The VLAN interface is a switch’s Layer 3 interface connected to the VLAN. If you want to route packets for the subnets on VLANs 11, 12, and 13, the matching VLAN interfaces must be numbered 11, 12, and 13. And both the VLANs and the VLAN interfaces can be disabled and enabled with the shutdown and no shutdown commands (as mentioned in Steps 3 and 4 in the previous list), so you have to check for both.\\nExample 19-9 shows three scenarios, each of which leads to one of the VLAN interfaces in \\nthe previous configuration example (Figure 19-3, Example 19-6) to fail. At the beginning of the example, all three VLAN interfaces are up/up. VLANs 10, 20, and 30 each have at least one access interface up and working. The example works through three scenarios: \\n■Scenario 1: The last access interface in VLAN 10 is shut down (F0/1), so IOS shuts down\\nthe VLAN 10 interface.\\n■Scenario 2: VLAN 20 (not VLAN interface 20, but VLAN 20) is deleted, which results inIOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 20 interface.\\n■Scenario 3: VLAN 30 (not VLAN interface 30, but VLAN 30) is shut down, whichresults in IOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the       VLAN 30 interface.\\nExample 19-9 Three Examples That Cause VLAN Interfaces to Fail\\nSW1# show interfaces status\\n!

That is, the physical interfaces receive Ethernet frames. The switch learns the source MAC address of the frame, and the switch forwards the frame based on the destination MAC address. The SVIs are then used when a frame happens to be destined to the SVI interface’s MAC address, as if the SVI       were attached to a router sitting within the center of the Layer 3 switch.\\nAlternately, the Layer 3 switch configuration can make a physical port act like a router \\ninterface instead of a switch interface. To do so, the switch configuration makes that port a routed port. On a routed port, when a frame is received on the physical interface, the switch does not perform Layer 2 switching logic on that frame. Instead, the switch performs routing actions, including\\n1. Stripping off the incoming frame’s Ethernet data link header/trailer\\n2. Making a Layer 3 forwarding decision by comparing the destination IP address to the\\nIP routing table\\n3. Adding a new Ethernet data link header/trailer to the packet\\n4. Forwarding the packet, encapsulated in a new frame\\nptg1739636319Chapter 19: IPv4 Routing in the LAN  535\\nThis third major section of the chapter examines routed interfaces as configured on Cisco \\nLayer 3 switches, but with a particular goal in mind: to also discuss Layer 3 EtherChannels. The exam topics do not mention routed interfaces specifically, but the exam topics do mention L3 EtherChannels, meaning Layer 3 EtherChannels. Layer 3 EtherChannels are EtherChannels (as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3) that are also routed ports instead of switched ports. So this section first looks at routed ports on Cisco Layer 3 switches, and then discusses Layer 3 EtherChannels.\\nImplementing Routed Interfaces on Switches\\nWhen a Layer 3 switch needs a Layer 3 interface connected         to a subnet, and only one physical interface connects to that subnet, the network engineer can choose to use a routed port instead of an SVI. Conversely, when the Layer 3 switch needs a Layer 3 interface con-nected to a subnet, and many physical interfaces on the switch connect to that subnet, an SVI needs to be used. (SVIs can forward traffic that the Layer 2 logic then sends out any of the ports in the VLAN, and routed ports cannot.)\\nTo see why, consider the design in Figure 19-4, which repeats the same design from Figure \\n19-3 (used in the SVI examples). In that familiar design, at least two access ports sit in both VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. However, that figure shows a single link from the switch to Router B1. As a result, the switch could configure that link as a routed port.\\nVLAN 20interface vlan 20\\n10.1.20.1/24interface vlan 10\\n10.1.10.1/24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 30\\ninterface G0/1\\n10.1.30.1/24G0/010.1.30.2B1The Middle Box Represents \\nthe Layer 3 Switch\\nF0/1\\nF0/2\\nF0/3\\nF0/4Routed\\nInterface\\nFigure 19-4 Routing on a Routed Interface on a Switch\\nEnabling a switch interface to be a routed interface instead of a switched interface is simple: \\njust use the no switchport subcommand on the physical interface. Cisco switches capable of being a Layer 3 switch use a default of the     switchport command to each switch physical interface. Think about the word switchport for a moment. With that term, Cisco tells the switch to treat the port like it is a port on a switch—that is, a Layer 2 port on a switch. To make the port stop acting like a switch port, and instead act like a router port, use the no \\nswitchport command on the interface.\\nOnce the port is acting as a routed port, think of it like a router interface. That is, configure \\nthe IP address on the physical port, as implied in Figure 19-4. Example 19-10 shows a com-pleted configuration for the interfaces configured on the switch in Figure 19-4. Note that the design uses the exact same IP subnets as the example that showed SVI configuration in Example 19-6, but now, the port connected to subnet 10.1.30.0 has been converted to a routed port. All you have to do is add the no switchport command to the physical inter-face, and         configure the IP address on the physical interface.\\nptg17396363536  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 19-10 Configuring Interface G0/1 on Switch SW1 as a Routed Port\\nip routing\\n!\\ninterface vlan 10\\n ip address 10.1.10.1 255.255.255.0\\n!interface vlan 20\\n ip address 10.1.20.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/1 no switchport\\n ip address 10.1.30.1 255.255.255.0\\nOnce configured, the routed interface will show up differently in command output in the \\nswitch. In particular, for an interface configured as a routed port with an IP address, like interface GigabitEthernet0/1 in the previous example:\\nshow interfaces: Similar to   the same command on a router, the output will display the IP \\naddress of the interface. (For switch ports, this command does not list an IP address.)\\nshow interfaces status: Under the “VLAN” heading, instead of listing the access VLAN \\nor the word “trunk,” the output lists the   word “routed,” meaning that it is a routed port.\\nshow ip route: Lists the routed port as an outgoing interface in routes. show interfaces type number switchport: If a routed port, the output   is short and con-\\nfirms that the port is not a switch port.

For any topolo-\\ngies with a point-to-point link between two devices that do routing, a routed interface works well. Figure 19-5 shows a typical core/distribution/access design with the core and distribution layers acting as Layer 3 switches. All the ports that are links directly between the Layer 3 switches can be routed interfaces. For VLANs for which many interfaces (access and trunk) connect to the VLAN, SVIs make sense, because the SVIs can send and receive         traffic out multiple ports on the same switch.\\nA11\\nA12\\nA13\\nA14A21\\nA22\\nA23\\nA24Point-to-Point, Layer 3 Distribution & CoreLayer 2 Access: SVIs\\nD11\\nD12D21 Core1\\nD22 Core2Layer 2 Access: SVIs\\nRouted Interfaces\\nFigure 19-5 Using Routed Interfaces for Core and Distribution Layer 3 Links\\nImplementing Layer 3 EtherChannels\\nSo far, this section has stated that routed       interfaces can be used with a single point-to-point link between pairs of Layer 3 switches, or between a Layer 3 switch and a router. However, in most designs, the network engineers use at least two links between each pair of distribu-tion and core switches, as shown in Figure 19-6.\\nWhile each individual port in the distribution and core could be treated as a separate routed \\nport, it is better to combine each pair of parallel links into a Layer 3 EtherChannel. Without using EtherChannel, you can still make each port on each switch in the center of the figure be a routed port. It works. However, once you enable a routing protocol, each Layer 3 switch will now learn two IP routes with the same neighboring switch as the next hop—one route over one link, another route over the other link.\\nptg17396363538  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nA11\\nA12\\nA13\\nA14A21\\nA22\\nA23\\nA24Layer 2 Access: SVIs\\nD11\\nD12D21 Core1\\nD22 Core2Layer 2 Access: SVIs\\nPoint-to-Point, Layer 3 Distribution & CoreRouted Interfaces\\nFigure 19-6 Two Links Between Each Distribution and Core Switch\\nUsing a Layer 3 EtherChannel makes more sense with multiple parallel links between two \\nswitches. By doing so, each pair of links acts as one Layer 3 link. So, each pair of switches has one routing protocol neighbor relationship with the neighbor, and not two. Each switch learns one route per destination per pair of links, and not two. IOS then balances the traf-fic, often with better balancing than Layer 3 balancing. Overall, the Layer 3 EtherChannel approach works much better than leaving each link as a separate routed port and using Layer 3 balancing.\\nCompared to what you have already learned, configuring a Layer 3 EtherChannel takes only \\na little more work. Chapter 3, “Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation,” already showed you how to configure an EtherChannel. This chapter has already shown how to make a port a Layer 3 routed port. So, to configure a Layer 3 EtherChannel, do both the EtherChannel and routed port configuration. The follow checklist shows the steps, assuming a static defi-nition       for the EtherChannel.\\nStep 1. Configure the physical interfaces as follows, in interface configuration mode:\\nA. Add the channel-group number mode on command to add it to the \\nchannel. Use the same number for all physical interfaces on the same \\nswitch, but the number used (the channel-group number) can differ on the two neighboring switches.\\nB. Add the no switchport command to make each physical port a routed \\nport.\\nStep 2. Configure the PortChannel interface:\\nA. Use the interface port-channel number command to move to port-\\nchannel configuration mode for the same channel number configured on the physical interfaces. \\nB. Add the no switchport command to make sure that the port-channel \\ninterface acts as a routed port. (IOS may have already added this com-mand.) \\nC. Use the ip address address mask command to configure the address \\nand mask.

For the purposes of understanding the technology, you may treat these terms as synonyms. However, it helps to pay close attention to the use of the terms PortChannel and EtherChannel as you work through the examples in this section, because IOS uses both.\\nExample 19-12 shows an example of the configuration for a Layer 3 EtherChannel for switch SW1 in Figure 19-7.

In fact, when the no switchport command is configured on an interface, IOS adds the     no ip \\naddress command to the interface. Then configure the IP address on the PortChannel inter-face only.\\nOnce configured, the PortChannel interface appears in several commands, as shown in \\nExample 19-13. The commands that list IP addresses and routes refer to the PortChannel interface. Also, note that the show interfaces status command lists the fact that         the physi-cal ports and the port-channel 12 interface are all routed ports. \\nptg17396363540  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 19-13 Verification Commands Listing Interface Port-Channel12 from \\nSwitch SW1\\nSW1# show interfaces port-channel 12\\nPort-channel12 is up, line protocol is up (connected) \\n  Hardware is EtherChannel, address is bcc4.938b.e543 (bia bcc4.938b.e543)\\n  Internet address is 10.1.12.1/24\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nSW1# show interfaces status\\n!

First, \\nyou need to look at the configuration of the channel-group command, which enables an interface for an EtherChannel. Second, you should check a list of settings that must match on the interfaces for a Layer 3 EtherChannel to work correctly.\\nAs for the channel-group interface   subcommand, this command can enable EtherChannel \\nstatically or dynamically. If dynamic, this command’s keywords imply either Port Aggregation Protocol (PaGP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as the pro-tocol to negotiate between the neighboring switches whether they put the link into the EtherChannel.\\nIf all this sounds vaguely familiar, it is the exact same configuration covered way back in the \\nChapter 3 section “Configuring Dynamic EtherChannels.” The configuration of the channel-group subcommand is exactly the same, with the same requirements, whether configuring Layer 2 or Layer 3 EtherChannels. So, it might be a good time to review those EtherChannel configuration details from Chapter 3. However, regardless of when you review and master those commands, note that the configuration of the EtherChannel (with the channel-group subcommand) is the same, whether Layer 2 or Layer 3.\\nAdditionally, you must do more than just configure the channel-group command correctly \\nfor all the physical ports to be bundled into the EtherChannel. Layer 2 EtherChannels have a longer list of requirements, but Layer 3 EtherChannels do require a few consistency checks between the ports before they can be added to the EtherChannel. The following is the list of requirements for Layer 3 EtherChannels:\\nno switchport: The PortChannel interface must be configured with the no \\nswitchport command, and so must the physical interfaces. If a physical interface is not \\nalso configured with the no switchport command, it will not become operational in the EtherChannel.\\nSpeed: The physical ports in the channel must use the same speed. duplex: The physical ports in the channel       must use the same duplex.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Some businesses rely more on the \\nnetwork than others, with a direct connection between network outages and lost revenue. For instance, when the network is down, some companies lose customers, or lose sales, or they cannot ship their goods to market, affecting sales volume in the future. Companies can design their networks to use redundancy—extra devices and extra links—so that when a device fails, or a link fails, the network still works. The extra devices may cost more money, but the cost may be justified, given the cost of an outage.\\nNetworks that have redundant devices and links sometimes require additional protocols to \\ndeal with changes to how the network functions with the added redundancy. This chapter introduces the concepts behind one such class of protocols, called    First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP). Then the majority of the chapter gets into the details of how to configure, verify, and troubleshoot one particular FHRP: Cisco’s    Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP).\\nThis chapter breaks the content into three major sections. The first looks at FHRP con-\\ncepts, and introduces the three FHRP options: HSRP, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol    (VRRP), and Gateway Load Balancing Protocol    (GLBP). The second section shows how to configure and verify HSRP, while the third section discusses how to troubleshoot HSRP. \\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

If each remote branch has \\ntwo WAN links connecting it to the rest of the network, those routers can use an IP routing protocol to pick the best routes. The routing protocol learns routes over both WAN links, adding the best route into the routing table. When the better WAN link fails, the routing protocol adds the alternate route to the IP routing table, taking advantage of the redundant link.\\nAs another example, consider a LAN with redundant links and switches, as discussed in \\nChapters 2, “Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts,” and Chapter 3, “Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation,” of this book. Those LANs have problems unless the switches use Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). STP prevents the problems created by frames that loop through those extra redundant paths in the LAN.\\nThis chapter examines yet another type of protocol that helps when a network uses some \\nredundancy, this time with redundant default routers. When two or more routers connect to the same LAN subnet, all those routers could be used as the default router for the hosts in the subnet. However, to make the best use of the redundant default routers, another pro-tocol is needed. The term First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) refers to the category of protocols that can be used so that the hosts take advantage of redundant routers in a subnet.\\nThis first major section of the chapter discusses the major concepts behind how different \\nFHRPs work. This section begins by discussing a network’s need for redundancy in general and the need for redundant default routers. It then shows how the three available FHRP options can each solve the problems that occur when using redundant default routers.\\nThe Need for Redundancy in Networks\\nNetworks need redundant links   to improve the availability of the network. Eventually, something in the network will fail. A router power supply might fail, or a cable might break, or a switch might lose power. And those WAN links, drawn as simple lines in most drawings in this book, are actually the most complicated physical parts of the network, with many individual parts that can fail as well.\\nDepending on the design of the network, the failure of a single component might mean an \\noutage that affects at least some part of the user population. Network engineers refer to any one component that, if it fails, brings down that part of the network as   a single point \\nof failure. For instance, in Figure 20-1, the LANs appear to have some redundancy, whereas the WAN does not. If most of the traffic flows between sites, many single points of failure exist, as shown in the figure.\\nThe figure notes several components as a single point of failure. If any one of the noted \\nparts of the network fails, packets cannot flow from the left side of the network to the right.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 D 2 C 3 C 4 B 5 C 6 A, C\\nptg17396363548  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n.9\\nDefault\\nGW=.9Single Points of Failure\\nSW1\\nSW2R1 R3 SW3\\nSW4VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nFigure 20-1 R1 and the One WAN Link as Single Points of Failure\\nGenerally speaking, to improve availability the network engineer first looks at a design and \\nfinds the single points of failure. Then, the engineer chooses where to add to the network, so that one (or more) single points of failure now have redundant options, increasing avail-ability. In particular, the engineer:\\n■Adds redundant devices and links\\n■Implements any necessary functions that take advantage of the redundant device or link\\nFor instance, of all the single points of failure in Figure 20-1, the most expensive over the long term would likely be the WAN link, because of the ongoing monthly charge. However, statistically, the WAN links are the most likely component to fail. So, a reasonable upgrade from the network in Figure 20-1 would be to add a WAN link and possibly even connect to another router on the right side of the network, as shown in Figure 20-2.\\n.9\\nDefault\\nGW=.9\\nRemote Main SiteSingle Points of Failure\\nSW1\\nSW2R1 R3\\nR4SW3\\nSW4VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nFigure 20-2 Higher Availability, But with R1 Still as a Single Point of Failure\\nMany real enterprise networks follow designs like Figure 20-2, with one router at each remote \\nsite, two WAN links connecting back to the main site, and redundant routers at the main site (on the right side of the figure). Compared to Figure 20-1, the design in Figure 20-2 has fewer single points of failure. Of the remaining single points of failure, a risk remains, but it is a cal-culated risk. For many outages, a reload of the router solves the problem, and the outage is short. But the risk still exists that the switch or router hardware fails completely and requires time to deliver a replacement device on-site before that site can work again.\\nFor enterprises that can justify more expense, the next step in higher availability for that \\nremote site is to protect against those catastrophic router and switch failures. In this par-ticular design, adding one router on the left side of the network in Figure 20-2 removes all the single points of failure that had been noted earlier. Figure 20-3 shows the design with a second router, which connects to a different LAN switch so that SW1 is also no longer    a single point of failure.\\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  549\\nG0/0\\n.9\\nDefault\\nGW=.9VLAN 10\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nSW1\\nSW2R1\\nG0/1\\nR2R3\\nR4SW3\\nSW4 .129\\nFigure 20-3 Removing All Single Points of Failure from the Network Design\\nNOTE Medium to large enterprise networks work hard at striking a balance of high-\\navailability features versus the available budget dollars. Cisco.com has many design documents that discuss trade-offs in high-availability design. If interested in learning more, search Cisco.com for “high availability campus network design.”\\nThe Need for a First Hop Redundancy Protocol\\nNow back to the topic of this chapter. Of the designs shown so far in this chapter, only Figure 20-3’s design has two routers to support the LAN of the left side of the figure, spe-cifically the same VLAN and subnet. While having the redundant routers on the same sub-net helps, the network needs to use an FHRP when these redundant routers exist.\\nTo see the need     and benefit of using an FHRP, first think about how these redundant rout-\\ners could be used as default routers by the hosts in VLAN 10/subnet 10.1.1.0/24, as shown in Figure 20-4. The host logic will remain unchanged, so each host has a single default rout-er setting. So, some design options for default router settings include the following:\\n■All hosts in the subnet use R1 (10.1.1.9) as their default router, and they statically recon-\\nfigure their default router setting to R2’s 10.1.1.129 if R1 fails.\\n■All hosts in the subnet use R2 (10.1.1.129) as their default router, and they statically\\nreconfigure their default router setting to R1’s 10.1.1.9 if R2 fails.\\n■Half the hosts use R1, and half use R2, as their default router, and if either router fails,\\nthat half of the users statically reconfigure their default router setting.\\nTo make sure the concept is clear, Figure 20-4 shows this third option, with half the hosts using R1 and the other half using R2. The figure removes all the LAN switches just to unclutter the figure. Hosts A and B use R1 as their default router, and hosts C and D use R2 as their default router.\\nAll of these options have a problem: The users have to take action. They have to know an \\noutage occurred. They have to know how to reconfigure their default router setting. And they have to know when to change it back to the original setting.\\nFHRPs make this design work better. The two routers appear to be a single default router. \\nThe users never have to do anything: Their     default router setting remains the same, and their ARP table even remains the same.\\nptg17396363550  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nR1 R3\\nR2 R4AGW=.9VLAN10, Subnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nG0/0\\n.9\\nG0/1\\n.129BGW=.9\\nCGW=.129\\nDGW=.129\\nFigure 20-4 Balancing Traffic by Assigning Different Default Routers to Different \\nClients\\nTo allow the hosts to remain unchanged, the routers have to do some more work, as defined \\nby one of the FHRP protocols. Generically, each FHRP    makes the following happen:\\n1. All hosts act like they always have, with one default router setting that never has to\\nchange.\\n2. The default routers share a virtual IP address in the subnet, defined by the FHRP.\\n3. Hosts use the FHRP virtual IP address as their default router address.\\n4. The routers exchange FHRP protocol messages, so that both agree as to which routerdoes what work at any point in time.\\n5. When a router fails, or has some other problem, the routers use the FHRP to choosewhich router takes over responsibilities from the failed router.\\nThe Three Solutions for First-Hop Redundancy\\nThe term First Hop Redundancy Protocol does not name any one protocol. Instead, it \\nnames a family of protocols that fill the same role. For a given network, like the left side of Figure 20-4, the engineer would pick one of the protocols from the FHRP family.\\nNOTE First Hop is a reference to the default router being the first router, or first router \\nhop, through which a packet must pass.\\nTable 20-2 lists the three FHRP protocols    in chronological order, based on when these were first used. Cisco first introduced the proprietary Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), and it worked well for many of its customers. Later, the IETF developed an RFC for a very simi-lar protocol, Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). Finally, Cisco developed a more robust option, Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP).\\nTable 20-2 Three FHRP Options\\nAcronym Full Name Origin Redundancy \\nApproachLoad \\nBalancing\\nHSRP Hot Standby Router Protocol Cisco Active/standby Per subnet\\nVRRP Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol RFC 5798 Active/standby Per subnetGLBP Gateway Load Balancing Protocol Cisco Active/active Per host\\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  551\\nThis chapter focuses on HSRP and    does not discuss VRRP and GLBP other than this brief \\nmention. HSRP, the first of the three FHRP protocols to enter the market, remains a popu-lar option in many networks. The next few pages walk through the concepts of how HSRP works. (Note that Appendix K contains a topic with more depth about GLBP, copied from an earlier edition of the book, if you are interested in reading more.)\\nHSRP Concepts\\nHSRP operates          with an active/standby model (also more generally called active/passive). \\nHSRP allows two (or more) routers to cooperate, all being willing to act as the default router. However, at any one time, only one router actively supports the end-user traffic. The packets sent by hosts to their default router flow to that one active router. Then, the other routers, with an HSRP standby state, sit there patiently waiting to take over should the active HSRP router have a problem.\\nThe HSRP active router implements a virtual IP address and matching virtual MAC address. \\nThis virtual IP address exists as part of the HSRP configuration, which is an additional con-figuration item compared to the usual ip address interface subcommand. This virtual IP address is in the same subnet as the interface IP address, but it is a different IP address. The router then automatically creates the virtual MAC address. All the cooperating HSRP rout-ers know these virtual addresses, but only the HSRP active router uses these addresses at any one point in time.\\nHosts refer to the virtual IP address as their default router address, instead of any one \\nrouter’s interface IP address. For instance, in Figure 20-5, R1 and R2 use HSRP. The HSRP virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1, with the virtual MAC address referenced     as VMAC1 for sim-plicity’s sake.\\nR1 R3\\nR2 R4AGW=.1\\nHSRPSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\n.1\\nVMAC1\\nBGW=.1\\nCGW=.1\\nDGW=.1\\nIP\\n10.1.1.1Host ARP TableHSRP StandbyHSRP Active\\nMACVMAC1\\nFigure 20-5 All Traffic Goes to .1 (R1, Which Is Active); R2 Is Standby\\nptg17396363552  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nHSRP Failover\\nHSRP on each router has some work      to do to make the network function as shown in \\nFigure 20-5. The two routers need HSRP configuration, including the virtual IP address. The two routers send HSRP messages to each other to negotiate and decide which router should currently be active, and which should be standby. Then, the two routers continue to send messages to each other so that the standby router knows when the active router fails so that it can take over as the new active router.\\nFigure 20-6 shows the result when R1, the HSRP active router in Figure 20-5, fails. R1 quits \\nusing the virtual IP and MAC address, while R2, the new active router, starts using these addresses. The hosts do not need to change their default router settings at all, with traffic now flowing to R2 instead of R1.\\nR1 R3\\nR2 R4AGW=.1\\nIP\\n10.1.1.1Host ARP Table.1\\n.9\\n.1\\n.129No Change\\nVMAC1\\nVMAC1\\nHSRP ActiveBGW=.1\\nCGW=.1\\nDGW=.1\\nNo ChangeMAC\\nVMAC1\\nFigure 20-6 Packets Sent Through R2 (New Active) Once It Takes Over for Failed R1\\nWhen the failover happens, some changes do happen, but none of those changes happen \\non the hosts. The host keeps the same default router setting, set to the virtual IP address (10.1.1.1 in this case). The host’s ARP table does not have to change either, with the HSRP virtual MAC being listed as the MAC address of the virtual router.\\nWhen the failover occurs, changes happen on both the routers and the LAN switches. \\nClearly, the new active router has to be ready to receive packets (encapsulated inside frames) using the virtual IP and MAC addresses. However, the LAN switches, hidden in the last few figures, formerly sent frames destined for VMAC1 to Router R1. Now the switches must know to send the frames to the new active router, R2.\\nTo make the switches change their MAC address table entries for VMAC1, R2 sends an \\nEthernet frame with VMAC1 as the source MAC address. The switches, as normal, learn the source MAC address (VMAC1), but with new ports that point toward R2. The frame is also a LAN broadcast, so all the switches learn a MAC table entry for VMAC1 that leads toward R2. (By the way, this Ethernet frame holds an ARP Reply message, called      a gratuitous ARP, because the router sends it without first receiving an ARP Request.)\\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  553\\nHSRP Load Balancing\\nThe active/standby model of HSRP means      that in one subnet all hosts send their off-subnet \\npackets through only one router. In other words, the routers do not share the workload, with one router handling all the packets. For instance, back in Figure 20-5, R1 was the active router, so all hosts in the subnet sent their packets through R1, and none of the hosts in the subnet sent their packets through R2.\\nHSRP does support load balancing by preferring different routers to be the active router \\nin different subnets. Most sites that require a second router for redundancy are also big enough to use several VLANs and subnets at the site. The two routers will likely connect to all the VLANs, acting as the default router in each VLAN. HSRP then can be configured to prefer one router as active in one VLAN, and another router as active in another VLAN, balancing the traffic. Or you can configure multiple instances of HSRP in the same subnet (called multiple HSRP groups), preferring one router to be active in one group, and the other router to be preferred as active in another.\\nFor instance, Figure 20-7 shows a redesigned LAN, now with two hosts in VLAN 1 and \\ntwo hosts in VLAN 2. Both R1 and R2 connect to the LAN, and both use a VLAN trunking and router-on-a-stick (ROAS) configuration. Both routers use HSRP in each of the two sub-nets, supporting each other. However, on purpose, R1 has been configured so that it wins the negotiation to become HSRP active in VLAN 1, and R2 has been configured to win in VLAN 2.\\nA\\nBGW=\\n10.1.1.1Active Subnet 1VLAN 1\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nVLAN 2\\nSubnet 10.1.2.0/24SW1\\nSW2R1\\nR2SW3\\nC\\nDGW=\\n10.1.2.1 SW410.1.1.1\\n10.1.2.1HSRPStandby Subnet 2\\nActive Subnet 2\\nStandby Subnet 1\\nFigure 20-7 Load Balancing with HSRP by Using Different Active Routers per Subnet\\nNote that by having each router act as the HSRP active router in some subnets, the design \\nmakes use of both routers and both WAN links.\\nFHRPs are needed on any device that acts as a default router, which of course includes both \\ntraditional routers and Layer 3 switches. HSRP can be configured on routers and Layer 3 switches on interfaces that have IP addresses configured. However, in most cases, HSRP is used on interfaces to subnets that have hosts that need to use a default router. Those inter-faces include router physical interfaces, router trunk subinterfaces, and Layer 3 switched      Virtual interfaces (SVI).\\nptg17396363554  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE This chapter refers to routers using HSRP, and shows examples on physical inter-\\nfaces, just to avoid having to repeatedly mention both routers and Layer 3 switches and the various interfaces. All concepts in this chapter about FHRPs and HSRP specifically apply to router physical interfaces, trunk subinterfaces, and SVIs.\\nImplementing HSRP\\nThis second major section of this chapter shows the configuration for basic functions of HSRP, with the matching show commands. The goal of this section is to show enough of the operation of each tool to reinforce the concepts discussed in the first section.\\nConfiguring and Verifying Basic HSRP\\nHSRP configuration      requires only one command on the two (or more) routers that want to share default router responsibilities with HSRP: the standby group ip virtual-ip interface \\nsubcommand. The first value defines the HSRP group number, which   must match on both routers. The group number lets one router support multiple HSRP groups at a time on the same interface, and it allows the routers to identify each other based on the group. The command also configures the virtual IP address shared by the routers in the same group; the virtual IP address is the address the hosts in the VLAN use as their default gateway.\\nExample 20-1 shows a configuration example, matching the HSRP examples related to \\nFigures 20-5 and 20-6. Both routers use group 1, with virtual IP address 10.1.1.1, with the standby 1 ip 10.1.1.1 interface subcommand.\\nExample 20-1 HSRP Configuration on R1 and R2, Sharing IP Address 10.1.1.1\\nR1# show running-config\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.1.9 255.255.255.0\\n standby version 2 standby 1 ip 10.1.1.1\\n standby 1 priority 110\\n standby 1 name HSRP-group-for-book\\n! The following configuration, on R2, is identical except for the HSRP priority and\\n! the interface IP address\\nR2# show running-config! Lines omitted for brevity\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.1.129 255.255.255.0\\n standby version 2 standby 1 ip 10.1.1.1\\n standby 1 name HSRP-group-for-book\\nThe configuration shows other optional parameters, as well. For instance, R1 has a priority \\nof 110 in this group, and R2 defaults to 100. With HSRP, if the two routers are brought up at the same time, the router with the higher priority      wins the election to become the active \\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  555\\nrouter. The configuration also shows a name that can be assigned to the group (when using \\nshow commands) and a choice to use HSRP Version 2. (This chapter provides more details on these settings in the coming pages.)\\nOnce configured, the two routers negotiate the HSRP settings and choose which router will \\ncurrently be active and which will be standby. With the configuration as shown, R1 will win the election and become active because of its higher (better) priority. Both routers reach the same conclusion, as confirmed with the output of the       show standby brief command on both R1 and R2 in Example 20-2.\\nExample 20-2 HSRP Status on R1 and R2 with show standby brief\\n! First, the group status as seen from R1\\nR1# show standby brief\\nP indicates configured to preempt.\\n|\\nInterface   Grp  Pri P State   Active          Standby Virtual IP\\nGi0/0 1    110   Active  local 10.1.1.129 10.1.1.1\\n!

First, look at the Grp column for each command. This \\nlists the HSRP group number, so when       looking at output from multiple routers, you need to look at the lines with the same group number to make sure the data relates to that one HSRP group. In this case, both routers have only one group number (1), so it is easy to find the information.\\nEach line of output lists the local router’s view of the HSRP status for that group. In particu-\\nlar, based on the headings, the show standby brief command       identifies the following:\\nInterface: The local router’s interface on which the HSRP group is configured\\nGrp: The HSRP group numberPri: The local router’s HSRP priorityState: The local router’s current HSRP stateActive: The interface IP address of the currently active HSRP router (or “local” if the \\nlocal router is HSRP active)\\nStandby: The interface IP address of the currently standby HSRP router (or “local” if the \\nlocal router is HSRP standby)\\nVirtual IP: The virtual IP address defined by this router for this group\\nFor instance, following the highlighted text in Example 20-2, R2 believes that its own cur-\\nrent state is standby, that the router with interface address 10.1.1.9 is active (which happens \\nptg17396363556  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nto be Router R1), with a confirmation      that the “local” router (R2, on which this command \\nwas issued) is the standby router.\\nIn comparison, the show standby command  (without the brief keyword)  lists a more \\ndetailed description of the current state, while repeating many of the facts from the show \\nstandby brief command. Example 20-3 shows an example of the new information with the show standby command, listing several counters and timers about the HSRP protocol itself, plus the virtual MAC address 0000.0c9f.f001.\\nExample 20-3 HSRP Status on R1 and R2 with show standby\\nR1# show standby\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 - Group 1 (version 2)\\n  State is Active\\n    6 state changes, last state change 00:12:53\\n  Virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1  Active virtual MAC address is 0000.0c9f.f001\\n    Local virtual MAC address is 0000.0c9f.f001 (v2 default)\\n  Hello time 3 sec, hold time 10 sec\\n    Next hello sent in 1.696 secs  Preemption disabled\\n  Active router is local\\n  Standby router is 10.1.1.129, priority 100 (expires in 8.096 sec)\\n  Priority 110 (configured 110)  Group name is \"HSRP-group-for-book\" (cfgd)\\n!

Those rules also define details about when a standby router should take over as active. The following list summarizes the rules; following the list, this section takes a closer look at those rules and the related configuration settings. \\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  557\\nFirst, the HSRP rules. When a router (call it the local router) has an HSRP-enabled interface, \\nand that interface comes up, the router sends      HSRP messages to negotiate whether it should be active or standby. When it sends those messages, if it…\\nStep 1. …discovers no other HSRP routers in the subnet, the local router becomes the \\nactive router.\\nStep 2. …discovers an existing HSRP router, and both are currently negotiating to \\ndecide which should become the HSRP active router, the routers negotiate, \\nwith the router with the highest HSRP priority becoming the HSRP active router.\\nStep 3. …discovers an existing HSRP router in the subnet, and that router is already \\nacting as the active router:\\nA. If configured with no preemption (the default; no standby preempt), \\nthe local router becomes a standby router, even if it has a better (higher) priority.\\nB. If configured with preemption (standby preempt), the local router \\nchecks its priority versus the active router; if the local router priority is better (higher), the local router takes over (preempts) the existing active router to become the new active HSRP router. \\nSteps 1 and 2 in the list are pretty obvious, but Steps 3A and 3B could use a little closer \\nlook. For instance, the examples so far in this chapter show R1’s G0/0 with a priority of 110 versus R2’s G0/0 with priority 100. The show commands in Example 20-3 show that R1 is currently the HSRP active router. That same example also lists a line for both R1 and R2 that confirms “preemption disabled,” which is the default.\\nTo show a test of Step 3A logic, Example 20-4 shows       a process by which R1’s G0/0 inter-\\nface is disabled and then enabled again, but after giving Router R2 long enough to take over and become active. That is, R1 comes up but R2 is already HSRP active for group 1. The bottom of the example lists output from the show standby brief command from R2, con-firming that R2 becomes HSRP active and R1 becomes standby (10.1.1.9), proving that R1 does not preempt R2 in this case.\\nExample 20-4 Showing How No Preemption Keeps R1 as Standby After R1 Recovers \\n!

Example 20-5 shows exactly that. Before the output in Example 20-5 was gathered, the network had been put back to the same beginning state as at the beginning of Example 20-4, with R1 active and R2 as standby. Within Example 20-5, R1’s interface is shut down, then configured with         preemption using the standby 1 preempt command, enabling preemption. Then, after enabling the interface \\nagain, R1 takes over as HSRP active, as shown at the bottom of the example’s show standby \\nbrief command from R2. That output now shows the local router’s state as Standby, and the active as 10.1.1.9 (R1).\\nExample 20-5 Showing How Preemption Causes R1 to Take over As Active upon \\nRecovery \\n!

For instance, in this case, R1 came up when R2 was active; R1 was set to preempt; so R1 preempted R2.\\nHSRP Versions\\nCisco IOS on routers and Layer 3 switches      supports two versions of HSRP: versions 1 and 2. The versions have enough differences, like multicast IP addresses used and message formats, so that routers in the same HSRP group must use the same version. If two routers config-ured to be in the same HSRP group mistakenly configure to use different versions, they will not understand each other and ignore each other for the purposes of HSRP.\\nTo configure the version, each interface/subinterface uses   the standby version {1 | 2} inter-\\nface subcommand. Note that the HSRP group number is not included in the command, \\nbecause it sets the version for all HSRP messages sent out that interface/subinterface.\\nThere are some good reasons to want to use the more recent  HSRP version 2 (HSRPv2). For \\nexample, HSRPv1 existed before IPv6 became popular. Cisco enhanced HSRP to version 2 in part to make IPv6 support possible. Today, to use HSRP with IPv6 requires HSRPv2.\\nAs another example of a benefit of HSRPv2, HSRP uses a Hello message, similar in concept \\nto routing protocols, so that HSRP group members can realize when the active router is no longer reachable. HSRPv2 allows for shorter Hello timer configuration (as low as a small number of milliseconds), while HSRPv1 typically had a minimum of 1 second. So, HSRPv2 can be configured to react more quickly to failures with a lower Hello timer. \\nBeyond IPv6 support and shorter Hello timer options, other differences for version 2 versus \\nversion 1 include a different virtual MAC address base value and a different multicast IP address used as the destination for all messages. Table 20-3      lists the differences between HSRPv1 and HSRPv2.  \\nTable 20-3 HSRPv1 Versus HSRPv2\\nFeature Version 1 Version 2\\nIPv6 support No Y es\\nSmallest unit for Hello timer Second Millisecond \\nRange of group numbers 0..255 0..4095\\nMAC address used (xx or xxx is the hex group number) 0000.0C07 .ACxx 0000.0C9F.Fxxx\\nIPv4 multicast address used 224.0.0.2 224.0.0.102\\nDoes protocol use a unique identifier for each router? No Y es\\nptg17396363560  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nOf the details in the table, make sure to look at the MAC addresses for both versions 1 and \\n2. Cisco reserves the prefixes of 0000.0C07.AC for HSRPv1 and 0000.0C9F.F for HSRPv2.HSRPv1, with 256 possible HSRP groups per interface, then uses the last two hex digits to identify the HSRP group. For example, an HSRP group 1 using version 1 would use a virtual MAC address that ends in hex 01. Similarly, because HSRPv2 supports 4096 groups per interface, the MAC address reserves three hex digits to identify the group. An HSRP      group 1 using version 2 would use a virtual MAC address that ends in hex 001.\\nTroubleshooting HSRP\\nTroubleshooting HSRP follows some familiar      themes in this book as far as the types of activities you should prepare to do. First, you need to master the configuration details so you can know when the configuration is correct or incorrect. As part of that, you need to be ready to figure out the configuration based on show commands other than the show running-config command; you need to be able to reverse engineer the configuration based on other show commands as much as possible.\\nAdditionally, you should have a good idea of which HSRP configuration settings need to \\nmatch on the routers in the same HSRP group. And it always helps to know what the show \\ncommand output would look like when some common configuration mistakes are made. \\nChecking HSRP Configuration\\nFirst, for the issue of determining          the configuration, take another moment to think about the output of the show standby command, but now with the goal of re-creating the config-uration in mind. To that end, Example 20-6 repeats the configuration of Router R1 from the running example used throughout this chapter. It also repeats the same show standby com-mand output from Example 20-3. In this new example, highlighted comments in the show \\ncommand output list the matching configuration command on which the output is based. \\nExample 20-6 Finding HSRP Configuration in the show standby Command Output\\n! First, the configuration of the HSRP group:\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.1.9 255.255.255.0\\n standby version 2\\n standby 1 ip 10.1.1.1 standby 1 priority 110\\n standby 1 name HSRP-group-for-book\\n! Next, the show standby command output\\nR1# show standby\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 - Group 1 (version 2) ! standby version 2\\n  State is Active\\n    6 state changes, last state change 00:12:53\\n  Virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1 ! standby 1 ip 10.1.1.1\\n  Active virtual MAC address is 0000.0c9f.f001\\n    Local virtual MAC address is 0000.0c9f.f001 (v2 default)\\n  Hello time 3 sec, hold time 10 sec    Next hello sent in 1.696 secs\\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  561\\n  Preemption disabled ! no standby 1 preempt \\n   (default)\\n  Active router is local\\n  Standby router is 10.1.1.129, priority 100 (expires in 8.096 sec)\\n  Priority 110 (configured 110) ! standby 1 priority 110\\n  Group name is \"HSRP-group-for-book\" (cfgd) ! standby 1 name HSRP-group-for-book\\nIf you work through the comments on the far right of the show command output (com-\\nments that begin with a !), you can mentally connect the concepts on that same line of show \\ncommand output with the four standby configuration commands at the top of the example. \\nNext, for HSRP to work correctly, some of the HSRP parameters must match. For instance, \\nif two routers were intended to be in the same HSRP group, but were configured with two different HSRP versions, they would not understand each other’s messages, and would ignore each other, and would act independently from each other. The following list details some important items to check to make sure the configurations should work:\\n■Routers must be configured with the same HSRP version (standby version {1 | 2})\\n■Routers must be configured with the same HSRP group number (standby number …).\\n■Routers must configure the same virtual IP address (standby number ip address).\\n■Virtual IP address must be (a) in the same subnet as the interface IP address and (b) not\\nused by any other device in the subnet (including the other HSRP routers) ( standby\\nnumber ip address).\\n■In the attached Layer 2 network, the interfaces on the routers or Layer 3 switches must\\nbe in the same VLAN.\\n■No ACLs should filter HSRP messages between the two routers. (HSRP uses UDP,\\nport 1985; version 1 sends to multicast address 224.0.0.2, while        version 2 sends to\\n224.0.0.102.)\\nSymptoms of HSRP Misconfiguration\\nIOS cannot detect several configuration      mistakes that vary from the good configuration \\nsuggestions in the previous list. So, think about what a good configuration would look like, and then imagine purposefully misconfiguring a single item. What would the symptoms be? Table 20-4 lists four such purposeful configuration mistakes. Each assumes that only one mistake is made. Following the table, the chapter takes a closer look at each.\\nTable 20-4 HSRP Misconfiguration Scenarios and Expected Results\\nReference \\nNumberScenario Routers Both Become Active?Duplicate Address Detected?VIP Changes Depending on Active Router?\\n1 HSRP version mismatch Y es Y es N/A\\n2 HSRP group number mismatch Y es Y es N/A \\n3 ACL blocks HSRP packets Y es No N/A\\n4 Routers configure different VIPs No N/A Y es\\nptg17396363562  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFor example, consider item 1 in the table, with an HSRP version mismatch. Example 20-7 \\nshows what happens, using the same design and configuration      shown throughout this chap-ter, starting with the configuration in Example 20-1. As shown in Example 20-7, R1’s HSRP version is changed to version 1, while R2’s remains as version 2.\\nExample 20-7 Misconfiguration Scenario: HSRP Routers Use Different HSRP Version \\n!

Both R1 and R2 begin to act independently. As you can see from the log messages and the show standby brief command output from both routers, both become active, and neither knows of another router that acts as standby. Basically, they ignore each other.\\nptg1739636320Chapter 20: Implementing HSRP for First-Hop Routing  563\\nContinuing in Example 20-7, because both routers      are active, both attempt to make use of \\nthe same virtual IP address 10.1.1.1. However, because both use a different HSRP version, they use different MAC addresses. Each router notices the duplicate use of the same virtual IP address, and begins to issue log messages like the highlighted message in the example. \\nWorking through the items in Table 20-4, number 2, the configuration of mismatched HSRP \\ngroup numbers results      in much the same results as shown in Example 20-7. The two routers do not attempt to work together. Both become active in their respective HSRP group, both try to use the same virtual IP address, and both notice the duplicate use of the virtual IP address, issuing log messages to that effect.\\nAs for item 3, an inbound ACL on       either router can filter HSRP traffic. HSRP messages \\nuse the local interface IP address as the source IP address. The destination address is either 224.0.0.2 (for version 1) or 224.0.0.102 (for version 2). Also, HSRP uses UDP port 1985. So, any ACL that happens to deny HSRP inbound would make the two routers again act independently. Often that also means that the routers do not notice use of duplicate IP addresses either.\\nFinally, for item 4, with the two routers configuring two different IP addresses to use as \\nthe virtual IP address, much different results occur. That is, if that is the only configuration mistake, both routers send and receive HSRP messages and choose the active and standby routers correctly. The active router uses the virtual IP address defined on the        active router. But if that router fails, and the other router becomes active, that second router uses its dif-ferent virtual IP address. Basically, the virtual IP address changes based on which router is active. As a result, devices that refer to one of the VIPs will only work when the matching router is active.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

This chapter is one of those chapters. As a result, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge level; so this chapter does not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly confident about troubleshooting IPv4 routing fea-tures covered in this book, feel free to move to the “Chapter Review” section near the end of this chapter to bypass  the majority of the chapter.\\nFoundation Topics\\nProblems Between the Host and the Default Router\\nImagine that you work as a customer support representative (CSR) fielding calls from users about problems. A user left a message stating that he couldn’t connect to a server. You could not reach him when you called back, so you did a series of pings from that host’s default router. At the end of those pings, you think the problem exists somewhere between the user’s device and the default router—for instance, between Router R1 and host A, as shown in Figure 21-1.\\nG0/0\\nR1A\\nSW1\\nIP Address\\nIP MaskDefault RouterDNS ServerProblem Domain\\nServer\\nFigure 21-1 Focus of the Discussions in This Section of the Chapter\\nThis first major section of the chapter focuses on problems that can occur on hosts, their \\ndefault routers, and between the two. To begin, this section looks at the host itself, and its four IPv4 settings, as listed in the figure. Following that, the discussion moves to the default router, with focus on the LAN interface, and the settings that must work for the router to serve as a host’s default router.\\nptg17396363568  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRoot Causes Based on a Host’s IPv4 Settings\\nA typical IPv4 host gets its four key IPv4 settings in one of two ways: either through static \\nconfiguration or by using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). In both cases, the settings can actually be incorrect. Clearly, any static settings can be set to a wrong number just through human error when typing the values. More surprising is the fact that the DHCP can set the wrong values: The DHCP process can work, but with incorrect values configured at the DHCP server, the host can actually learn some incorrect IPv4 settings.\\nThis section first reviews the settings on the host, and what they should match, followed by \\na discussion of typical issues.\\nEnsure IPv4 Settings Correctly Match\\nOnce      an engineer thinks that a problem exists somewhere between a host and its default router, the engineer should review the host’s IPv4 settings versus the intended settings. That process begins by guiding the user through the graphical user interface (GUI) of the host operating system or by using command-line commands native to host operating systems, such as   ipconfig and   ifconfig. This process should uncover obvious issues, like completely \\nmissing parameters, or if using DHCP, the complete failure of DHCP to learn any of the IPv4 settings.\\nIf the host has all its settings, the next step is to check the values to match them with the \\nrest of the internetwork. The Domain Name System (DNS) server IP address—usually a list of at least two addresses—should match the DNS server addresses actually used in the inter-network. The rest of the settings should be compared to the correct LAN interface on the router that is used as this host’s default router. Figure 21-2 collects all the pieces that should match, with some explanation to follow     .\\nDNS1\\nAddress\\nDNS2Address\\nG0/0\\nAddressDNS\\nA\\nR11\\nDefault Router2\\nMask Mask\\nMath Math34\\nAddress + Mask\\nSubnet ID &\\nAddress Range4\\nFigure 21-2 Host IPv4 Settings Compared to What the Settings Should Match\\nAs      numbered in the figure, these steps should be followed to check the host’s IPv4 settings:\\nStep 1. Check the host’s list of DNS server addresses against the actual addresses used \\nby those servers.\\nStep 2. Check the host’s default router settings against the router’s LAN interface con-\\nfiguration, for the   ip address command.\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   569\\nStep 3. Check the subnet mask used by the router and the host; if they use a different \\nmask, the subnets will not exactly match, which will cause problems for some \\nhost addresses.\\nStep 4. The host and router should attach to the exact same subnet—same subnet ID \\nand same range of IP addresses. So, use both the router’s and host’s IP address \\nand mask, calculate the subnet ID and range of addresses, and confirm they are in the same subnet as the subnet implied by the address/mask of the router’s ip \\naddress command     .\\nIf an IPv4 host configuration setting is missing, or simply wrong, checking these settings can \\nquickly uncover the root cause. For instance, if you can log in to the router and do a   show \\ninterfaces G0/0 command, and then ask the user to issue an ipconfig /all (or similar) com-mand and read the output to you, you can compare all the settings in Figure 21-2.\\nHowever, although checking the host settings is indeed very useful, some problems related \\nto hosts are not so easy to spot. The next few topics walk through some example problems to show some symptoms that occur when some of these less obvious problems      occur.\\nMismatched Masks Impact Route to Reach Subnet\\nA        host and its default router should agree about the range of addresses in the subnet. Sometimes, people are tempted to skip over this check, ignoring the mask either on the host or the router and assuming that the mask used on one device must be the same mask as on the other device. However, if the host and router have different subnet mask values, and therefore each calculates a different range of addresses in the subnet, problems happen.\\nTo see one such example, consider the network in Figure 21-3. Host A has IP address/mask \\n10.1.1.9/24, with default router 10.1.1.150. Some quick math puts 10.1.1.150—the default router address—inside host A’s subnet, right? Indeed it does, and it should. Host A’s math for this subnet reveals subnet ID 10.1.1.0, with a range of addresses from 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.254, and subnet broadcast address        10.1.1.255.\\n10.1.1.150/25\\n10.1.1.9/24\\nDefault RouterOSPFA\\nR1R2\\nR3If Destination is NOT from\\n10.1.1.0 –10.1.1.255, Send to R1\\nFigure 21-3 Mismatched Subnet Calculations Appear to Work\\nIn this case, the host routing of packets, to destinations outside the subnet, works well. \\nHowever, the reverse direction, from the rest of the network back toward the host, does not. A quick check of Router R1’s configuration reveals the IP address/mask as shown in Figure 21-3, which results in the connected route for subnet 10.1.1.128/25, as shown in        Example 21-1.\\nptg17396363570  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 21-1 R1’s IP Address, Mask, Plus the Connected Subnet That Omits Host A’s \\nAddress\\nR1# show running-config interface g0/0\\nBuilding configuration...\\nCurrent configuration: 185 bytes\\n!interface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n description LAN at Site 1\\n mac-address 0200.0101.0101\\n ip address 10.1.1.150 255.255.255.128 ip helper-address 10.1.2.130\\n duplex auto\\n speed auto\\nend\\nR1# show ip route connected\\n!

Other routes omitted for brevity\\nBecause of this particular mismatch, R1’s view of the subnet puts host A (10.1.1.9) outside \\nR1’s view of the subnet (10.1.1.128/25, range 10.1.1.129 to 10.1.1.254). R1 adds a con-nected route for subnet 10.1.1.128/25 into R1’s routing table, and even advertises this route (with Open Shortest Path First [OSPF] in this case) to the other routers in the network, as shown in Figure 21-4. All the routers know how to route packets to subnet 10.1.1.128/25, but unfortunately that route does not include host A’s 10.1.1.9 IP        address.\\n10.1.1.150/25\\n10.1.1.9/24OSPFA\\nR1R2\\nR3Connected Route to\\n10.1.1.128  /25 does NOT Match 10.1.1.9\\n10.1.1.128/25OSPF Route to10.1.1.128  /25 does NOT Match 10.1.1.9\\nFigure 21-4 Routers Have No Route That Matches Host A’s 10.1.1.9 Address\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   571\\nHosts should use the same subnet mask as the default router, and the two devices should \\nagree as to what subnet exists on their common LAN. Otherwise, problems may exist imme-diately, as in this example, or they might not exist until other hosts are added later       .\\nTypical Root Causes of DNS Problems\\nWhen      a host lists the wrong IP addresses for the DNS servers, the symptoms are somewhat obvious: Any user actions that require name resolution fail. Assuming that the only problem is the incorrect DNS setting, any network testing with commands like   ping and traceroute \\nfails when using names, but it works when using IP addresses instead of names.\\nWhen a ping of another host’s hostname fails, but a ping of that same host’s IP address \\nworks, some problem exists with DNS. For example, imagine a user calls the help desk com-plaining that he cannot connect to Server1. The CSR issues a ping server1 command from the CSR’s own PC, which both works and identifies the IP address of Server1 as 1.1.1.1. Then the CSR asks the user to try two commands from the user’s PC: both a ping Server1 \\ncommand (which fails), and a ping 1.1.1.1 command (which works). Clearly, the DNS name resolution process on the user’s PC is having some sort of problem.\\nThis book does not go into much detail about how DNS truly works behind the scenes, but \\neven with a basic analysis, two major types of potential DNS issues are obvious: \\n■ A user host (DNS client) that has an incorrect setting for the DNS server IP address(es)\\n■ An IP connectivity problem between the user’s host and the correct DNS      server\\nAlthough the first problem may be more obvious, note that it can happen both with static settings on the host and with DHCP. If a host lists the wrong DNS server IP address, and the setting is static, just change the setting. If the wrong DNS server address is learned with DHCP, you need to examine the DHCP server configuration. (If using the IOS DHCP server feature, you make this setting with the   dns-server server-address command in DHCP pool \\nmode.)\\nThe second bullet point brings up an important issue for troubleshooting any real-world \\nnetworking problem. Most every real user application uses names, not addresses, and most hosts use DNS to resolve names. So, every connection to a new application involves two sets of packets: packets that flow between the host and the DNS server, and packets that flow between the host and the real server, as shown in Figure      21-5.\\nA1\\n2DNS Server\\n2.2.2.2\\nServer 11.1.1.1\\nFigure 21-5 DNS Name Resolution Packets Flow First; Then Packets to the Real Server\\nFinally, before leaving the topic of name resolution, note that the router can be config-\\nured with the IP addresses of the DNS servers, so that router commands will attempt to \\nptg17396363572  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nresolve names. For instance, a user of the router command-line interface (CLI) could issue \\na command ping server1  and rely on a DNS request to resolve server1 into its matching \\nIP address. To configure a router to use a DNS for name resolution, the router needs the   ip name-server  dns1-address dns2-address … global command. It also needs the   ip \\ndomain-lookup  global command, which is enabled by default.\\nFor troubleshooting, it can be helpful to set a router or switch DNS settings to match that of the local hosts. However, note that these settings have no impact on the user DNS      requests.\\nNOTE On a practical note, IOS defaults with the   ip domain-lookup command, but with \\nno DNS IP address known. Most network engineers either add the configuration to point to the DNS servers or disable DNS using the   no ip domain-lookup command.\\nWrong Default Router IP Address Setting\\nClearly     , having a host that lists the wrong IP address as its default router causes problems. Hosts rely on the default router when sending packets to other subnets, and if a host lists the wrong default router setting, the host may not be able to send packets to a different subnet.\\nFigure 21-6 shows just such an example. In this case, hosts A and B both misconfigure \\n10.1.3.4 as the default router due to the same piece of bad documentation. Router R3 uses IP address 10.1.3.3. (For the sake of discussion, assume that no other host or router in this subnet currently uses address 10.1.3.4.     )\\nInterface G0/1\\n  ip address 10.1.3.3 255.255.255.192VLAN 1\\nSW3Default Router is 10.1.3.4\\n10.1.3.810.1.3.9\\nR3A\\nB\\nFigure 21-6 Incorrect Default Router Setting on Hosts A and B\\nIn this case, several functions do work. For instance, hosts A and B can send packets to \\nother hosts on the same LAN. The CSR at the router CLI can issue a   ping 10.1.3.9 and ping \\n10.1.3.8 command, and both work. As a result of those two working pings, R3 would list the MAC address of the two PCs in the output of the   show arp command. Similarly, the \\nhosts would list R3’s 10.1.3.3 IP address (and matching MAC address) in their ARP caches (usually displayed with the arp –a command). The one big problem in this case happens when the hosts try to send packets off-subnet. In that case, try to send the packets to IP address 10.1.3.4 next, which      fails.\\nRoot Causes Based on the Default Router’s Configuration\\nHosts must have correct IPv4 settings to work properly, but having correct settings does not guarantee that a LAN-based host can successfully send a packet to the default router. The LAN between the host and the router must work. In addition, the router itself must be working correctly, based on the design of the internetwork.\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   573\\nThis next topic looks at problems between hosts and their default router, focusing on two \\nproblem areas. First, the text examines typical DHCP issues, followed by a discussion of router interfaces and what causes that interface to fail.\\nDHCP Issues\\nHosts      that use DHCP to lease an IP address, and learn other settings, rely on the network to pass the DHCP messages. In particular, if the internetwork uses a centralized DHCP server, with many remote LAN subnets using the centralized DHCP server, the routers have to enable a feature called   DHCP Relay to make DHCP work. Without DHCP Relay, DHCP \\nrequests from hosts never leave the local LAN subnet.\\nFigure 21-7 shows some of the big ideas behind how DHCP Relay works. In this example, \\na DHCP client (Host A) sits on the left, with the DHCP server (172.16.2.11) on the right. The client begins the DHCP lease process by sending a DHCP Discover message, one that would flow only across the local LAN without DHCP Relay configured on Router R1. To be ready to forward the Discover message, R1 enables DHCP Relay with the   ip helper-address \\n172.16.2.11 command configured under its G0/0      interface.\\nBA\\nDHCP Server\\n172.16.2.11172.16.1.1\\nG0/0 R1 R2\\nDiscover\\nFrom 0.0.0.0To 255.255.255.2551 Discover\\nFrom 172.16.1.1To 172.16.2.112S1ip helper-address 172.16.2.11\\nFigure 21-7 IP Helper Address Effect\\nThe steps in the figure point out the need for DHCP Relay. At Step 1, host A sends a mes-sage, with destination IP and L2 broadcast address of 255.255.255.255 and ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.ff, respectively. Packets sent to this IP address, the “local subnet broadcast address,” should never be forwarded past the router. All devices on the subnet receive and process the frame. In addition, because of the   ip helper-address command configured on R1, Router R1 will \\ncontinue to de-encapsulate the frame and packet to identify that it is a DHCP request and take action. Step 2 shows the results of DHCP Relay, where R1 changes both the source and destination IP address, with R1 routing the packet to the address listed in the command     : 172.16.2.11.\\nThe following troubleshooting checklist gives us a place to start when troubleshooting \\nDHCP-related issues:\\nStep 1. If using a centralized DHCP server, at least one router on each remote subnet that has DHCP clients must act as DHCP relay agent, and have a correctly con-figured ip helper-address address subcommand on the interface connected to \\nthat subnet.\\nStep 2. Troubleshoot for any IP connectivity issues between the DHCP relay agent and the DHCP server, using the relay agent interface IP address and the server IP address as the source and destination of the packets.\\nptg17396363574  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStep 3. Whether using a local DHCP server or centralized server, troubleshoot for any \\nLAN issues between the DHCP client and the DHCP relay agent.\\nStep 4. Troubleshoot incorrect server configuration. \\nAlso, if the configuration includes the   ip helper-address command but lists the wrong \\nDHCP server IP address, again DHCP fails completely.\\nFor instance, Example 21-2 shows an updated configuration for ROAS on Router R3, based \\non the same scenario as in Figure 21-7. The router configuration works fine for supporting IPv4 and making the router reachable. However, only one subinterface happens to list an ip \\nhelper-address      command.\\nExample 21-2 Forgetting to Support DHCP Relay on a ROAS Subinterface\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1\\n ip address 10.1.3.3 255.255.255.192\\n ip helper-address 10.1.2.130\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1.2 encapsulation dot1q 2\\n ip address 10.1.3.65 255.255.255.192\\n! There is no ip helper-address command on this subinterface!\\nIn this case, hosts in subnet 10.1.3.0/26 (off interface G0/1) that want to use DHCP can, \\nassuming the host at address 10.1.2.130 is indeed the DHCP server. However, hosts in sub-net 10.1.3.64/26 (off subinterface G0/1.2) will fail to learn settings with DHCP because of the lack of an   ip helper-address command.\\nThe second step in the checklist begs for the use of an extended   ping  or extended   \\ntraceroute  command. Remember, the DHCP relay agent changes the source and destina-\\ntion IP address of the original DHCP request, using the relay agent interface IP address as the source. Figure 21-8 shows an example, with the DHCP relay agent interface as 172.16.1.1 and the server at 172.16.2.11. From the relay agent router’s CLI (Router R1), an extended ping of 172.16.2.11, using R1’s G0/1 IP address of 172.16.1.1 as the source addresses, would use those exact same IP addresses     .\\n172.16.1.0/24 172.16.2.0/24172.16.1.1\\nEcho Request\\nEcho ReplyS0/0/0\\n.2\\n.11R1 R2 SW1 SW2B AG0/0\\n.51\\nFigure 21-8 IP Helper Address Effect\\nAs for Steps 3 and 4 in the list of DHCP relay agent troubleshooting tips, the next topic looks at the issues related to Step 3, focusing on interfaces on the local LAN. As for Step 4, which focuses on DHCP server misconfiguration, the ICND1 book’s Chapter 20, “DHCP and IP Networking on Hosts,” discusses server configuration issues in depth     .\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   575\\nRouter LAN Interface and LAN Issues\\nAt some       point, the problem isolation process may show that a host cannot ping its default \\nrouter and vice versa. That is, neither device can send an IP packet to the other device on the same subnet. This basic test tells the engineer that the router, host, and LAN between them, for whatever reasons, cannot pass the packet encapsulated in an Ethernet frame between the two devices.\\nThe root causes for this basic LAN connectivity issue fall into two categories:\\n■ Problems that cause the router LAN interface to fail\\n■ Problems with the LAN itself\\nA router’s LAN interface must be in a working state before the router will attempt to send \\npackets out that interface (or receive packets in that interface). Specifically, the router LAN interface must be in an up/up state; if in any other state, the router will not use the interface for packet forwarding. So, if a ping from the router to a LAN host fails (or vice versa), check the interface status, and if it’s not up, find the root cause for the router interface to not be up.\\nAlternatively, the router interface can be in an up/up state, but problems can exist in the \\nLAN itself. In this case, every topic related to Ethernet LANs may be a root cause. In par-ticular, LAN details such as Ethernet cable pinouts, port security, and even Spanning Tree Protocol, may be root causes of LAN issues.\\nFor instance, in Figure 21-9, Router R3 connects to a LAN with four switches. R3’s LAN \\ninterface (G0/1) can reach an up/up state if the link from R3 to SW1 works. However, many other problems could prevent R3 from successfully sending an IP packet, encapsulated in an Ethernet frame, to the hosts attached to switches SW3 and SW4      .\\nA BG0/1Router G0/1\\nIs Not Up/Up\\nF0/1\\nSW1\\nSW3\\nESW5\\nC DSW2\\nSW4R2 R3Router G0/1\\nIs Up/Up\\nFigure 21-9 Where to Look for Problems Based on Router LAN Interface Status\\nNOTE This book leaves the discussion of LAN issues, as shown on the right side of Figure 21-9, to the various LAN-focused chapters of the ICND1 and ICND2 books.  \\nRouter LAN interfaces can fail to reach a working up/up state for several reasons, including the common reasons listed in Table 21-1      .\\nptg17396363576  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 21-1 Common Reasons Why Router LAN Interfaces Are Not Up/Up\\nReason Description Router Interface \\nState\\nSpeed mismatchThe router and switch can both use the speed interface \\nsubcommand to set the speed, but to different speeds.Down/down\\nShutdown at routerThe router interface has been configured with the shutdown interface subcommand.Admin down/down\\nShutdown at switchThe neighboring switch interface has been configured with the shutdown interface subcommand, while the router interface is no shutdown.Down/down\\nErr-disabled switchThe neighboring switch port uses port security, which has put the port in an err-disabled state.Down/down\\nNo cable/bad cableThe router has no cable installed, or the cable pinouts are incorrect.*Down/down\\n* Cisco switches use a feature called auto-mdix, which automatically detects some incorrect cabling pin-\\nouts and internally changes the pin logic to allow the cable to be used.

The link simply cannot work at these different speeds, so the router and switch inter-faces both fall to a down/down state.

This second major section now looks at issues related to how routers for-ward the packet from the default router to the final host.\\nIn particular, this section begins by looking at the IP routing logic inside a single router. \\nThese topics review how to understand what a router currently does. Following that, the discussion expands to look at some common root causes of routing problems, causes that come from incorrect IP addressing, particularly when the addressing design uses variable-length subnet masks (VLSM).\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   577\\nThe end of this section turns away from the core IP forwarding logic, looking at other issues \\nthat impact packet forwarding, including issues related to router interface status (which needs to be up/up) and how IPv4 access control lists (ACL) can filter IPv4 traffic.\\nIP Forwarding by Matching the Most Specific Route\\nAny     router’s IP routing process requires that the router compare the destination IP address of each packet with the existing contents of that router’s IP routing table. Often, only one route matches a particular destination address. However, in some cases, a particular destina-tion address matches more than one of the router’s routes.\\nThe following router features can create overlapping subnets:\\n■ Autosummarization\\n■ Manual route summarization\\n■ Static routes\\n■ Incorrectly designed subnetting plans that cause subnets to overlap their address ranges\\nIn some cases, overlapping routes cause a problem; in other cases, the overlapping routes \\nare just a normal result of using some feature. This section focuses on how a router chooses which of the overlapping routes to use, for now ignoring whether the overlapping routes are a problem. The section “Routing Problems Caused by Incorrect Addressing Plans,” later in this chapter, discusses some of the problem cases.\\nNow on to how a router matches the routing table, even with overlapping routes in its rout-\\ning table. If only one route matches a given packet, the router uses that one route. However, when more than one route matches a packet’s destination address, the router uses the “best” route, defined as follows:\\nWhen a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a router’s IPv4 routing table, the router uses the most specific route—in other words, the route with the longest prefix length mask.\\nUsing show ip route and Subnet Math to Find the Best Route\\nWe humans have a couple of ways to figure out what choice a router makes for choosing the best route. One way uses the   show ip route command, plus some subnetting math, to \\ndecide the route the router will choose. To let you see how to use this option, Example 21-4 shows a series of overlapping routes    .\\nExample 21-4 show ip route Command with Overlapping Routes\\nR1#   show ip route ospf\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\nD - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area\\nN1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2\\nE1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2\\ni - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2\\nia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route\\no - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP\\n+ - replicated route, % - next hop override\\nptg17396363578  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGateway of last resort is 172.16.25.129 to network 0.0.0.0\\n     172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 5 masks\\nO 172.16.1.1/32 [110/50] via 172.16.25.2, 00:00:04, Serial0/1/1\\nO 172.16.1.0/24 [110/100] via 172.16.25.129, 00:00:09, Serial0/1/0\\nO 172.16.0.0/22 [110/65] via 172.16.25.2, 00:00:04, Serial0/1/1\\nO 172.16.0.0/16 [110/65] via 172.16.25.129, 00:00:09, Serial0/1/0\\nO 0.0.0.0/0 [110/129] via 172.16.25.129, 00:00:09, Serial0/1/0\\n!\\nNOTE As an aside, the   show ip route ospf command lists only OSPF-learned routes, but \\nthe statistics for numbers of subnets and masks (9 and 5 in the example, respectively) are for \\nall routes, not just OSPF-learned routes.\\nTo predict which of its routes a router will match, two pieces of information are required: the destination IP address of the packet and the contents of the router’s routing table. The subnet ID and mask listed for a route define the range of addresses matched by that route. With a little subnetting math, a network engineer can find the range of addresses matched by each route. For instance, Table 21-2 lists the five subnets listed in Example 21-4 and the address ranges implied by each    .\\nTable 21-2 Analysis of Address Ranges for the Subnets in Example 21-4\\nSubnet/Prefix Address Range\\n172.16.1.1/32 172.16.1.1 (just this one address)\\n172.16.1.0/24 172.16.1.0–172.16.1.255172.16.0.0/22 172.16.0.0–172.16.3.255172.16.0.0/16 172.16.0.0–172.16.255.2550.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0–255.255.255.255 (all addresses)\\nNOTE The route listed as 0.0.0.0/0 is the default route.\\nAs you can see from these ranges, several of the routes’ address ranges overlap. When \\nmatching more than one route, the route with the longer prefix length is used. That is, a route with /16 is better than a route with /10; a route with a /25 prefix is better than a route with a /20 prefix; and so on    .\\nFor example, a packet sent to 172.16.1.1 actually matches all five routes listed in the rout-\\ning table in Example 21-4. The various prefix lengths range from /0 to /32. The longest prefix (largest /P value, meaning the best and most specific route) is /32. So, a packet sent to 172.16.1.1 uses the route to 172.16.1.1/32, and not the other routes.\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   579\\nThe following list gives some examples of destination IP addresses. For each address, the \\nlist describes the routes from Table 21-2 that the router would match, and which specific route the router would use.\\n172.16.1.1: Matches all five routes; the longest prefix is /32, the route to 172.16.1.1/32.\\n172.16.1.2: Matches last four routes; the longest prefix is /24, the route to \\n172.16.1.0/24.\\n172.16.2.3: Matches last three routes; the longest prefix is /22, the route to \\n172.16.0.0/22.\\n172.16.4.3: Matches the last two routes; the longest prefix is /16, the route to \\n172.16.0.0/16.\\nUsing show ip route address to Find the Best Route\\nA second     way to identify the route a router will use, one that does not require any subnet-ting math, is the   show ip route address command. The last parameter on this command is \\nthe IP address of an assumed IP packet. The router replies by listing the route it would use to route a packet sent to that address.\\nFor example, Example 21-5 lists the output of the show ip route 172.16.4.3 command \\non the same router used in Example 21-4. The first line of (highlighted) output lists the \\nmatched route: the route to 172.16.0.0/16. The rest of the output lists the details of that particular route, like the outgoing interface of S0/1/0 and the next-hop router of 172.16.25.129.\\nExample 21-5 show ip route Command with Overlapping Routes\\nR1# show ip route 172.16.4.3\\nRouting entry for 172.16.0.0/16\\n  Known via \"ospf 1\", distance 110, metric 65, type intra area\\n  Last update from 10.2.2.5 on Serial0/1/0, 14:22:06 ago\\n  Routing Descriptor Blocks:\\n* 172.16.25.129, from 172.16.25.129, 14:22:05 ago, via Serial0/1/0\\nRoute metric is 65, traffic share count is 1\\nCertainly, if you have an option, just using a command to check what the router actually \\nchooses is a much quicker option than doing the subnetting math    .\\nshow ip route Reference\\nThe   show ip route command plays a huge role in troubleshooting IP routing and IP routing protocol problems.

Both automatic and manual route summarization result in overlapping routes on some routers, with those overlaps not causing problems. However, some overlaps, par-ticularly those related to addressing mistakes, can cause problems for user traffic. So, when troubleshooting, if overlapping routes exist, the engineer should also look for the specific reasons for overlaps that actually cause a problem.\\nSimple mistakes in either the IP addressing plan or the implementation of that plan can \\ncause overlaps that also cause problems. In these cases, one router claims to be connected to a subnet with one address range, while another router claims to be connected to another subnet with an overlapping range, breaking IP addressing rules. The symptoms are that the routers sometimes forward the packets to the right host, but sometimes not.\\nThis problem can occur whether or not VLSM is used. However, the problem is much hard-\\ner to find when VLSM is used. This section reviews VLSM, shows examples of the problem both with and without VLSM, and discusses the configuration and verification commands related to these problems.\\nRecognizing When VLSM Is Used or Not\\nAn internetwork       is considered to be using VLSM when multiple subnet masks are used for different subnets of a single classful network. For example, if in one internetwork all sub-nets come from network 10.0.0.0, and masks /24, /26, and /30 are used, the internetwork uses VLSM.\\nSometimes people fall into the trap of thinking that any internetwork that uses more \\nthan one mask must be using VLSM, but that is not always the case. For instance, if an internetwork uses subnets of network 10.0.0.0, all of which use mask 255.255.240.0, and subnets of network 172.16.0.0, all of which use a 255.255.255.0 mask, the design does not use VLSM. Two different masks are used, but only one mask is used in any single classful network. The design must use more than one mask for subnets of a single classful network to be using VLSM.\\nOnly classless routing protocols can support VLSM. The three IPv4 IGP routing proto-\\ncols included in the current CCNA Routing and Switching certification (RIPv2, OSPF, and EIGRP) are all classless routing protocols   .\\nOverlaps When Not Using VLSM\\nEven   when you are not using VLSM, addressing mistakes that create overlapping subnets can occur. For instance, Figure 21-11 shows a sample network with router LAN IP address/mask information. An overlap exists, but it might not be obvious at first glance.\\nptg17396363582  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n/25\\n/25 10.1.1.130/25 10.1.2.2\\n10.1.2.251\\nR1 R3R2\\nR4/2510.1.1.200\\nFigure 21-11 IP Addresses on LAN Interfaces, with One Mask (/25) in Network 10.0.0.0\\nIf an overlap exists when all subnets use the same mask, the overlapping subnets have the \\nexact same subnet ID, and the exact same range of IP addresses in the subnet. To find the overlap, all you have to do is calculate the subnet ID of each subnet and compare the num-bers. For instance, Figure 21-12 shows an updated version of Figure 21-11, with subnet IDs shown and with identical subnet IDs for the LANs off R3 and R4   .\\n10.1.1.128/25Best Route to\\n10.1.1.128/25\\nOverlap!10.1.2.0/25\\n10.1.2.128/25\\nR1 R3R2\\nR410.1.1.128/25\\nA C\\nDB\\nBest Route to10.1.1.128/25\\nFigure 21-12 Subnet IDs Calculated from Figure 21-11\\nUsing the same subnet in two different places (as is done in Figure 21-12) breaks the rules \\nof IPv4 addressing because the routers get confused about where to send packets. In this case, for packets sent to subnet 10.1.1.128/25, some routers send packets so they arrive at R3, whereas others think the best route points toward R4. Assuming all routers use a routing protocol, such as OSPF, both R3 and R4 advertise a route for 10.1.1.128/25.\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   583\\nIn this case, R1 and R2 will likely send packets to two different instances of subnet \\n10.1.1.128/25. With these routes, hosts near R1 will be able to communicate with 10.1.1.128/25 hosts off R4’s LAN, but not those off R3’s LAN, and vice versa.\\nFinally, although the symptoms point to some kind of routing issues, the root cause is an \\ninvalid IP addressing plan. No IP addressing plan should use the same subnet on two differ-ent LANs, as was done in this case. The solution: Change R3 or R4 to use a different, non-overlapping subnet on its LAN interface     .\\nOverlaps When Using VLSM\\nWhen     using VLSM, the same kinds of addressing mistakes can lead to overlapping subnets; they just may be more difficult to notice.\\nFirst, overlaps between subnets that have different masks will cause only a partial overlap. \\nThat is, two overlapping subnets will have different sizes and possibly different subnet IDs. The overlap occurs between all the addresses of the smaller subnet, but with only part of the larger subnet. Second, the problems between hosts only occur for some destinations (specifically the subset of addresses in the overlapped ranges), making it even tougher to characterize the problem.\\nFor instance, Figure 21-13 shows an example with a VLSM overlap. The figure shows only \\nthe IP address/mask pairs of router and host interfaces. First, look at the example and try to find the overlap by looking at the IP addresses   .\\n172.16.4.1/23\\n172.16.9.2/30\\n172.16.9.6/30172.16.9.5/30172.16.9.1/30\\n172.16.2.1/23\\n172.16.2.2172.16.5.2\\n172.16.5.3172.16.5.1/24R1R2\\nR3PC2\\nPC3PC1\\nFigure 21-13 VLSM IP Addressing Plan in Network 172.16.0.0\\nTo    find the overlap, the person troubleshooting the problem needs to analyze each sub-\\nnet, finding not only the subnet ID but also the subnet broadcast address and the range of addresses in the subnet. If the analysis stops with just looking at the subnet ID, the overlap may not be noticed (as is the case in this example).\\nFigure 21-14 shows the beginning analysis of each subnet, with only the subnet ID listed. \\nNote that the two overlapping subnets have different subnet IDs, but the lower-right subnet (172.16.5.0/24) completely overlaps with part of the upper-right subnet (172.16.4.0/23). (Subnet 172.16.4.0/23 has a subnet broadcast address of 172.16.5.255, and subnet 172.16.5.0/24 has a subnet broadcast address of 172.16.5.255    .)\\nptg17396363584  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n172.16.2.0/23\\nOverlap172.16.9.0/30Route to... \\nRoute to... 172.16.9.4/30172.16.4.0/23\\n172.16.5.0/24R1R2\\nR3PC2\\nPC3PC1\\nFigure 21-14 A VLSM Overlap Example, but with Different Subnet IDs\\nTo be    clear, the design with actual subnets whose address ranges overlap is incorrect and \\nshould be changed. However, once implemented, the symptoms show up as routing prob-lems, like the similar case without VLSM. ping commands fail, and traceroute commands do complete for only certain hosts (but not     all).\\nConfiguring Overlapping VLSM Subnets\\nIP      subnetting rules require that the address ranges in the subnets used in an internetwork should not overlap. IOS sometimes can recognize when a new   ip address command creates \\nan overlapping subnet, but sometimes not, as follows:\\nPreventing the overlap on a single router: IOS detects the overlap when the ip address command implies an overlap with another ip address command on the same router.\\nAllowing the overlap on different routers: IOS cannot detect an overlap when an ip \\naddress command overlaps with an ip address command on another router.\\nThe router shown in Example 21-6 prevents the configuration of an overlapping VLSM subnet. The example shows Router R3 configuring Fa0/0 with IP address 172.16.5.1/24 and attempting to configure Fa0/1 with 172.16.5.193/26. The ranges of         addresses in each subnet are as follows:\\nSubnet 172.16.5.0/24: 172.16.5.1–172.16.5.254\\nSubnet 172.16.5.192/26: 172.16.5.193–172.16.5.254\\nExample 21-6 Single Router Rejects Overlapped Subnets\\nR3# configure terminal\\nR3(config)# interface Fa0/0\\nR3(config-if)# ip address 172.16.5.1 255.255.255.0\\nR3(config-if)# interface Fa0/1\\nR3(config-if)# ip address 172.16.5.193 255.255.255.192% 172.16.5.192 overlaps with FastEthernet0/0\\nR3(config-if)#\\nptg1739636321Chapter 21: Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing   585\\nIOS knows that it is illegal to overlap the ranges of addresses implied by a subnet. In this \\ncase, because both subnets would be connected subnets, this single router knows that these two subnets should not coexist because that would break subnetting rules, so IOS rejects the second command.\\nAs an aside of how IOS handles these errors, IOS only performs the subnet overlap check \\nfor interfaces that are not in a shutdown state. When configuring an interface in shutdown state, IOS actually accepts the   ip address command that would cause the overlap. Later, \\nwhen the no shutdown command is issued, IOS checks for the subnet overlap and issues the same error message shown in Example 21-6. IOS leaves the interface in the shutdown state until the overlap condition has been resolved.\\nIOS cannot detect the configuration of overlapping subnets on different routers, as shown \\nin Example 21-7. The example shows the configuration of the two overlapping subnets on R2 and R3 from Figure 21-13        .\\nExample 21-7 Two Routers Accept Overlapped Subnets\\n!

However, other chapters of the ICND1 and ICND2 books explain troubleshoot-ing of a couple of other features that directly impact a router’s forwarding logic. This short section references those other topics for completeness, even though the details sit in other chapters.\\nRouter WAN Interface Status\\nOne     of the steps in the IP routing troubleshooting process described earlier, in the “Router LAN Interface and LAN Issues” section, says to check the interface status, ensuring that the required interface is working. For a router interface to be working, the two interface status codes must both be listed as up, with engineers usually saying the interface is “up and up.”\\nTo fully troubleshoot the IPv4 data plane over WAN links, you should look closely at the \\ntroubleshooting topics in Chapter 13, “Implementing Point-to-point WANs,” of this book. Anything that prevents a serial link from being in an up/up state would of course prevent the routers on that link from sending packets to each other.\\nIn addition, note that a link can be in an up/up state on both ends but still have IPv4 for-\\nwarding issues. A serial link with both interfaces up/up means that Layers 1 and 2 work well, but Layer 3 might still have an issue. In particular, the classic case is the misconfiguration of IPv4 addresses on the two ends of the link, such that the addresses are in different subnets.\\nMake sure to review all these details about troubleshooting WAN links in Chapter 13.\\nptg17396363586  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFiltering Packets with Access Lists\\nPractically    every networking device used today has some ability to filter traffic at the data \\nplane. That is, the device can monitor packets during the forwarding process, compare those packets to a list of rules, and discard (filter) some packets based on those rules. Cisco IOS calls this feature   access control lists (ACL).\\nPart IV of this book spent a fair amount of time on ACLs, with Chapter 17, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists,” specifically discussing troubleshooting IPv4 ACLs from the command line. This chapter does not repeat those same ideas, but make sure to keep those thoughts in mind when troubleshooting the IPv4 data plane. Note that Chapter 17 includes some details about how ACLs filter packets, as well as how ACLs impact the ping command.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

For this first Part Review mind map, work through these topics, all of which were discussed to a troubleshooting level of depth in the chapters. Think about root causes, or any configuration checks you would do. Then organize those thoughts into a mind map. \\nIf you can, create one mind map for all topics. If not, break it into one map for the topics \\nin Chapters 19 and 20, as listed next, and another map for the wide variety of topics in Chapter 21. The topics from Chapters 19 and 20 include:\\nROAS, L3 switching with SVI, L3 switching with routed ports and L3 EtherChannels, HSRP\\nAnd the topics from Chapter 21:\\nhost IP settings, default router issues, routing issues\\nYou will find yourself going beyond what I might have put in the chapters, particularly for Chapter 21. That is great! That is part of what the mind map does, helping you own what Part V Review\\nptg17396363you learned here and combining it with other things you know. So do not worry if you add \\nsomething I did not happen to include in the sample mind map.\\nTo organize the mind map, once you see several root causes that are related, group those \\nroot causes by whatever category comes to mind. These might be the same kinds of symptoms you would see when doing problem isolation. For instance, you might note root causes about Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), like a router missing its DHCP Relay configuration (\\nip helper-address ), and another cause that no IP connectivity exists \\nto the DHCP server. So, group these DHCP root causes together in one category, something like Host DHCP. Figure P5-1 shows an example.\\nFigure P5-1 Subset Example of the IPv4 Root Cause Mind Map\\nNOTE For more information about mind mapping, see the section “About Mind Maps” in the Introduction to this book.\\nCreate Commands Mind Map\\nPart V also introduced the configuration and verification details for ROAS, L3 switching with SVIs, and L3 switching with routed interfaces and L3 EtherChannels. It also discussed HSRP. Create a mind map that organizes the commands by each of these topics, and inside each topic organize the commands as either configuration or verification commands.\\nAppendix E, “Mind Map Solutions,” lists sample mind map answers. If you do choose to \\nuse mind map software, rather than paper, you might want to remember where you stored your mind map files.

For ICND1, Cisco included the basics: addressing, subnetting, routing, router addresses, and static route configuration. ICND2 includes routing protocol topics, specifically with OSPF and EIGRP, as well as IPv6 ACLs. \\nOnly three ICND2 exam topics mention IPv6 specifically: one that lists EIGRP for IPv6, one \\nthat lists OSPF for IPv6, and one that mentions IPv6 ACLs. All three exam topics include the verbs configure, verify, and troubleshoot. To meet those needs, Chapter 23 works through the OSPF for IPv6 details for configuration, verification, and troubleshooting, while Chapter 24 does the same for EIGRP for IPv6. Chapter 25 completes this part with the details of IPv6 ACLs. \\nThis part begins with Chapter 22, a chapter that meets two purposes. First, to perform tasks \\nfor ICND2’s IPv6 exam topics, you need solid skills with ICND1’s IPv6 topics. Chapter 22 reviews those topics. Additionally, to be ready to troubleshoot OSPF for IPv6, EIGRP for IPv6, and IPv6 ACLs, you need to have IPv6 data plane troubleshooting concepts fresh in mind. Chapter 22 does just that by reviewing ICND1’s IPv6 topics, and giving you some mental exercises while thinking through a variety of IPv6 troubleshooting issues.\\nptg17396363Part VI\\nIPv6\\nChapter 22:  IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting\\nChapter 23:  Implementing OSPF for IPv6\\nChapter 24:  Implementing EIGRP for IPv6\\nChapter 25:  IPv6 Access Control Lists\\nPart VI Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 22\\nIPv6 Routing Operation and \\nTroubleshooting\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n2.0 Routing Technologies\\n2.5 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot single area and multiarea OSPFv3 for IPv6 (exclud-\\ning authentication, filtering, manual summarization, redistribution, stub, virtual-link, and LSAs)\\n2.7 Configure, verify, and troubleshoot EIGRP for IPv6 (excluding authentication, filter-\\ning, manual summarization, redistribution, stub)\\nThe first step in troubleshooting any networking technology is to understand what should \\nhappen under normal conditions. Then, the troubleshooting process can compare the cur-rent network behavior with what should be happening, looking for differences, until the root cause of those differences can be found.\\nThis chapter begins with a review of the ICND1 book’s discussion about how IPv6 works \\nnormally. Thankfully, IPv6 has many similarities to IPv4, other than the obvious differences in addressing. This section builds on those similarities and summarizes the core features of IPv6 to set the stage for a discussion of troubleshooting IPv6.\\nThe second major section of the chapter examines a variety of problems that can occur in \\nan IPv6 network. \\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nA few of the troubleshooting chapters in this book not only discuss troubleshooting of specific topics but also serve as a tool to summarize and review some important topics. This chapter is one of those chapters. As a result, it is useful to read these chapters regardless of your current knowledge level. Therefore, this chapter does not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. However, if you feel particularly confident about IPv6 features covered in this book and in the CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide, feel free to move to the “Chapter Review” section near the end of this chapter to bypass the majority of the chapter.\\nFoundation Topics\\nNormal IPv6 Operation\\nTo be ready to troubleshoot an IPv6 problem, you have to remember many facts about how IPv6 works. Thankfully, many IPv6 concepts work much like IPv4, but there are enough differences to make it worth the time to review IPv6 as an end to itself. This first section of the chapter reviews the details of IPv6, condensing many of the concepts from the five IPv6 \\nchapters of the ICND1 book into one concise review section.\\nptg17396363This first section, from this page up to the heading “Troubleshooting IPv6,” repeats con-\\ncepts discussed in the ICND1 book. If you are using both books, you might need to go back and review, or you might be ready to skip this section, as suggested here:\\nSkip to “Troubleshooting IPv6”: If you know IPv6 well, right now, skip ahead. For \\ninstance, maybe you are following a reading plan under which you just finished reading the ICND1 book’s IPv6 chapters and the material is fresh in your mind. Just know that this first section introduces no new concepts as compared to the ICND1 book’s IPv6 chapters.\\nRead this section: If you remember some of your IPv6 knowledge, but not all, this sec-\\ntion is built for you. Keep reading!\\nGo back and review the ICND1 book: If you have not thought about IPv6 for quite \\na while, and you really do not remember much at all about it, you might be better off reviewing the IPv6 chapters in the ICND1 book first.\\nSo, what is in this section? It hits the highlights of IPv6. Of course, it reviews IPv6 unicast \\naddressing and subnetting. This section also discusses host IPv6 configuration, including stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and stateful Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). It reviews basic protocols, like    Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), and commands, like ping and traceroute. This section also reviews router configuration for addressing and static routes.\\nUnicast IPv6 Addresses and IPv6 Subnetting\\nIPv6 defines    two major types of unicast IPv6 addresses. Global unicast addresses    work like \\npublic IPv4 addresses in that the enterprise obtains a unique prefix with all addresses inside the enterprise beginning with that prefix. With all companies using unique prefixes, all addresses in the IPv6 Internet should be unique.\\nUnique local unicast addresses      work more like private addresses. A company can randomly \\ncreate a prefix and assign addresses that begin with that prefix. Unique local addresses let companies avoid having to register a prefix while still having a good statistical chance of not using the same address range as other companies.\\nTo create subnets   with global unicast addresses, a company starts with the global routing \\nprefix—the prefix assigned to the enterprise—and then breaks the address structure into three parts. In almost all cases, including most cases in this book and the ICND1 book, the combined global routing prefix and subnet part of the address makes up the first half (64 bits) of the address structure. The subnet part gives the enterprise network engineer a place to number each subnet with a different value, uniquely identifying each subnet. Then, the remainder of the structure leaves room for a 64-bit interface ID (or host field). Figure 22-1 summarizes these rules.\\nFor example, a company might receive a global routing prefix of 2001:DB8:1111::/48. That \\nis, all addresses must begin with those 12 hex digits. The subnet part of the addresses exists in the entire fourth quartet. Those subnet numbers can be (hex) 0000, 0001, 0002, and so on, up through FFFF, for 65,536 possible subnets in this example. As   a result, the company might end up with a subnet design as shown in Figure 22-2.\\nptg17396363594  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nGlobal Routing Prefix Interface ID Subnet\\n64-PP Bits I Bits S BitsSet by Local\\n EngineerSet By IANA, \\nRIR, or ISP\\nP + S + I = 128\\nFigure 22-1 Structure of Subnetted IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses\\nNOTE IPv6 formally uses the term  prefix rather than subnet, but many people use either \\nterm when discussing IPv6 addressing.\\nR2 R1\\nISPG0/0S0/0/1S0/1/0 G0/0\\nG0/1\\nG0/0Prefix\\n2001:DB8:1111 :0001::/64\\nPrefix\\n2001:DB8:1111 :0004::/64Prefix\\n2001:DB8:1111 :0003::/64Prefix\\n2001:DB8:1111 :0002::/64\\nFigure 22-2 Subnet Design with Global Routing Prefix of 2001:0DB8:1111\\nAlthough Figure 22-2 is helpful for subnet planning, it does not list the specific IPv6 \\naddresses. Like IPv4, IPv6 follows the same general rules. For example, hosts and routers connected to the same Ethernet VLAN need to be in the same IPv6 subnet. Figure 22-3 shows an example with the IPv6 addresses in the appropriate subnets   to match Figure 22-2.\\nG0/1R2 R1PC1 PC2\\n2001:DB8:1111: 4::1\\n2001:DB8:1111: 4::3G0/0 S0/0/1S0/1/0 G0/02001:DB8:1111: 1::92001:DB8:1111: 1::1\\n2001:DB8:1111: 2::12001:DB8:1111: 2::2\\n2001:DB8:1111: 3::22001:DB8:1111: 3::9\\nISPG0/0\\nFigure 22-3 Example Static IPv6 Addresses Based on the Subnet Design of Figure 22-2\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  595\\nHosts can use global unicast and unique local unicast addresses to send and receive IPv6 \\npackets with other hosts, but IPv6 defines a special type of unicast address used for packets that stay on a single link: the link-local address. Many    protocols need to send IPv6 packets that flow only in the local subnet, with no need for routers to forward the packets to any other subnets. IPv6 uses link-local addresses for these protocols. Note that hosts can create their own link-local address even before the host has a valid global unicast or unique local address.\\nIPv6 hosts and routers create their own link-local address for each interface using \\nsome basic rules. First, all link-local addresses start with the same 16-digit prefix (FE80:0000:0000:0000), as shown on the left side of Figure 22-4. The router or host then forms the final 16 hex digits using EUI-64 rules, as discussed in the upcoming section “Stateless Address Autoconfiguration.”\\nFE80  :  0000  :  0000  :  000064 Bits\\nInterface ID: EUI-6464 Bits\\nFigure 22-4 Link-local Address Format\\nTable 22-1 summarizes a few bits of reference information    about global unicast and unique local unicasts for reference.\\nTable 22-1 Summary of IPv6 Unicast Address Types\\nType First Digits Similar to IPv4 Public or Private?\\nGlobal unicast 2 or 31Public\\nUnique local unicast FD Private\\nLink-local FE80 N/A\\n1 IANA actually defines the global unicast address range as any address not otherwise reserved for some \\nother purpose. However, actual address assignments normally happen from 2000::/3 because that was the \\noriginal range used for these addresses. Many IPv6 references simply quote 2000::/3 as the prefix, which means the first hex digit is either a 2 or 3.\\nAssigning Addresses to Hosts\\nOnce all the addressing details have been discussed, registered, and documented, the \\naddresses must be configured on the various hosts and routers. This next topic examines how to add IPv6 configuration (including addressing) to IPv6 hosts.\\nFrom a learning perspective, IPv6 host configuration     is a little more complex than IPv4. \\nIPv6 adds another protocol to the mix—Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)—and has two options through which hosts can learn their IPv6 settings. Learning how IPv6 hosts dynami-cally learn their IPv6 settings just takes a little more effort than with IPv4.\\nIPv6 hosts have three basic options to set their IPv6 options: static configuration, stateful \\nDHCP, and SLAAC. With static configuration, someone just types the options into the right part of the user interface, so this section does not discuss the static configuration option further. The next two topics look at the two dynamic options.\\nptg17396363596  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStateful DHCPv6\\nStateful DHCPv6 follows      the same general process as DHCP for IPv4 (DHCPv4):\\n1. A DHCP server or servers exist somewhere in the internetwork.\\n2. User hosts use DHCP messages to ask for a lease of an IP address and information\\nabout other settings.\\n3. The server replies, assigning an address to the host and informing the host of the\\nother settings.\\nThe one noticeable difference between DHCPv4 and stateful DHCPv6 is that the stateful \\nDHCPv6 server does not supply the default router information. Instead, a built-in protocol, NDP, lets the host ask the local routers to identify themselves. Otherwise, hosts use the same general process as with DHCPv4. Figure 22-5 shows a comparison of what is learned by a host using DHCPv4 and stateful DHCPv6.\\nUnicast Address\\nPrefix Length\\nDNS ServersStateful DHCPv6\\nDefault RouterNDP\\nUnicast Address\\nSubnet Mask\\nDNS ServersDHCPv4\\nDefault RouterIPv4 IPv6\\nFigure 22-5 Sources of Specific IPv6 Settings When Using Stateful DHCP\\nIf the stateful DHCPv6 server sits on a different subnet than the host, DHCPv6 relies on the DHCPv6 relay agent function, as   shown in Figure 22-6. For instance, on the left, host A begins its attempt to learn an address to use by sending a DHCPv6 Solicit message. This message goes to an IPv6 multicast destination address of FF02::1:2, and routers, like R1, would not normally forward a packet sent to this local-scope multicast address. However, with the DHCPv6 relay agent configuration added to R1’s G0/0 interface, as shown in the figure, R1       forwards host A’s DHCPv6 message to the DHCP server.\\nB A\\nDHCP Serveripv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:DB8:1111:3::8\\n2001:DB8:1111:1::1\\nG0/0 R1R2\\nSolicit\\n)URP\\x03$·V\\x03/LQN\\x10/RFDOTo FF02::1:21 Solicit\\nFrom 2001:DB8:1111: 2::1To 2001:DB8:1111:3::82S1\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::82001:DB8:1111: 2::1\\nS0/0/0\\nFigure 22-6 DHCPv6 Relay Agent and DHCP IPv6 Addresses\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  597\\nStateless Address Autoconfiguration\\nIPv6’s stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) provides      an alternative method for \\ndynamic IPv6 address assignment—without needing a stateful server. In other words, SLAAC does not require a server to lease the IPv6 address and record (keep state information) about which host has which IPv6 address, as is the case with the stateful DHCPv6 service.\\nSLAAC defines an overall process that also uses NDP and DHCPv6 with a stateless service; \\nthe server keeps no state information. First, the process takes    advantage of NDP, through which the host can learn the following from any router on the link: the IPv6 prefix (subnet ID), the prefix length (mask equivalent), and the default router IPv6 address. The host uses SLAAC rules to build the rest of its address. Finally, the host uses stateless DHCPv6 to learn the DNS server IPv6 addresses. Figure 22-7 summarizes these details for easy study and reference.\\nPrefix\\nPrefix LengthNDP\\nUnicast AddressSLAAC\\nDefault RouterStateless DHCPv6\\nDNS Servers\\nFigure 22-7 Sources of Specific IPv6 Settings When Using SLAAC\\nWith SLAAC, a host learns values for three settings (prefix length, router address, and DNS servers), but the host builds the value to use as its address. To build the address, a host uses these steps:\\n1. Learn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP Router\\nSolicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) messages.\\n2. Choose an interface ID value to follow the just-learned IPv6 prefix, either by random-\\nly choosing a number, or by using the host’s MAC address and using EUI-64 rules.\\nIf the host uses the EUI-64 option, the address built by the host can be predicted. The prefix part of the address is the prefix as defined on the local IPv6 router. Then, the host’s MAC address feeds into a few EUI-64 (also called modified EUI-64) rules to change the 48-bit MAC         address into a 64-bit interface ID, as follows:\\n1. Split the 6-byte (12 hex digits) MAC address in two halves (6 hex digits each).\\n2. Insert FFFE in between the two, making the interface ID now have a total of 16 hex\\ndigits (64 bits).\\n3. Invert the seventh bit of the first byte.\\nFigure 22-8 shows the major pieces of how       the address is formed.\\nptg17396363598  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSubnet Prefix1st Half\\nof MACFFFE2nd Half\\nof MACLearned with NDP\\nInvert 7th Bit, 1st Byte\\n(Reading Left to Right)Calculated by Host\\nFigure 22-8 IPv6 Address Format with Interface ID and EUI-64\\nRouter Address and Static Route Configuration\\nAt this point in this section, you have reviewed IPv6 addresses, IPv6 subnetting, and how to \\nassign addresses to hosts. This next topic looks at how to assign addresses to routers, enable IPv6 routing, and configure static IPv6 routes.\\nConfiguring IPv6 Routing and Addresses on Routers\\nTo enable     IPv6 on a router, you have two basic tasks:\\nStep 1. Use the ipv6 unicast-routing global   command to enable IPv6 routing.\\nStep 2. Use the   ipv6 address address/length subcommand in interface configura-\\ntion mode to enable IPv6 on each desired interface, and set the interface IPv6 \\naddress and prefix length.\\nIn many cases inside enterprises, the IPv6 implementation plan uses  a dual-stack strategy, \\nat least on the routers and possibly on hosts. That is, the routers still route IPv4 packets and \\nstill have IPv4 addresses on their interfaces. The configuration then adds IPv6 routing as a second Layer 3 protocol routed by the routers, leading to the name “dual stack.”\\nExample 22-1 shows a configuration example for adding IPv6 configuration to Router R1, \\nbased on what you saw in Figure 22-3. In that figure, R1 uses three interfaces, with the entire address shown in each case. As a result, Example 22-1 statically configures     the entire address. Note also that the prefix length, /64 in this case, sits immediately after the address, without a space. (The IPv4 configuration, not shown, usually already exists with a dual-stack approach.)\\nExample 22-1 IPv6 Addressing Configuration on Router R1 from Figure 22-3\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\ninterface serial0/0/1\\n  ipv6 address 2001:db8:1111:2::1/64\\n!interface gigabitethernet0/0\\n  ipv6 address 2001:db8:1111:1::1/64\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet0/1  ipv6 address 2001:db8:1111:4::1/64Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  599\\nAlternatively, routers can also use addresses formed using  EUI-64 rules. To configure a \\nrouter for this option, the ipv6 address command has two changes. First, the command lists only the prefix, and not the entire address, because the router creates the inter-face ID part of the address. The command also lists an eui-64 keyword at the end. For instance, to instead     use EUI-64 on R1’s G0/0 interface, you use the command ipv6 address \\n2001:db8:1111:1::/64 eui-64.\\nIPv6 Static Routes on Routers\\nAs for IPv6 routes, most enterprises use a dynamic IPv6 routing protocol, such as Open Shortest Path First Version 3 (OSPFv3; Chapter 23, “Implementing OSPF for IPv6”) or Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing       Protocol (EIGRP) for IPv6 (see Chapter 24, “Implementing EIGRP for IPv6”). However, routers also support static routes, of course.\\nRouters support three basic options for IPv6 static routes about how to tell a router where \\nto send packets next. Figure 22-9 shows all three options, as follows:\\n1. Direct the packets out an interface on the local router.\\n2. Direct the packets to the unicast address of a neighboring router.\\n3. Direct the packets to the link-local address of a neighboring router (requires the out-\\ngoing interface, as well).\\nSend to Global Unicast\\nSend to Link LocalFor Packets Destined to this Subnet\\n2001:DB8:1111:2::2\\nFE80::FF:FE00:2A\\n:1:11G0/0\\n:22R2G0/0\\n:2\\nSubnet 3\\n2001:DB8:1111: 3:: /64R1B2001:DB8:1111:2::1\\nS0/0/1\\nSend out Local Interface12\\n3\\nFigure 22-9 Three Options for IPv6 Static Route Configuration\\nExample 22-2 shows a static route to match the figure in each of the three styles. A single \\nrouter would not use three static routes for the same destination IPv6 prefix; the example just shows all three as a review of the syntax of each       command.\\nExample 22-2 Static IPv6 Routes: Three Options\\n!

To find the existing problems, the engineer needs to try various commands to test the network to verify what works properly and what does not. This next topic reviews a few commands useful for verifying IPv6 connectivity both on hosts and on routers.\\nVerifying Connectivity from IPv6 Hosts\\nThe first item to check with on any IPv6 host should be the four key IPv6 settings on a host, as shown on the left side of Figure 22-10. This verification step should not only look at the host itself but also compare the host’s settings to the other devices in the network. For instance, the host’s default router (default gateway) setting should       match the address config-ured on a local router.\\nDNS1 DNS2Interface Unicast\\nIPv6 Address\\nAssociated\\nPrefix Length\\nDefault Router\\nIPv6 Address\\nDNS Server\\nIPv6 Address(es)\\nHost IPv6 SettingsR1R2PC1 PC2\\nFigure 22-10 IPv6 Settings Needed on Hosts\\nHosts usually support some way to see IPv6 settings from the graphical user interface (GUI) and use commands. For the main four IPv6 settings, the ipconfig (Windows operating sys-tems) and ifconfig (Linux and Mac OS X) usually show some of the settings.

For a brief review here, the extended IPv6 options on the router ping and traceroute commands let you test routes back to the correct source subnet. For instance, in Figure 22-12, an extended ping from R1 to PC2’s IPv6 address tests the forward route to PC2. However, if the extended ping uses R1’s G0/0 interface as the source, this command also tests the reverse route back to PC1’s IPv6 subnet.\\nSubnet 3\\n2001:DB8:1111:3 ::/64Subnet 1\\n2001:DB8:1111:1 ::/64\\n::11 ::22 ::2 R2 R1Subnet 2\\n2001:DB8:1111:2 ::/64\\n::1 ::1 ::2G0/0S0/1/01 2\\nEcho Request\\nEcho Reply\\nFigure 22-12 Destination and Source Address of Extended Ping in Example 22-5\\nExample 22-5 shows the extended IPv6 ping from R1 to PC2 using R1’s G0/0 interface as \\nthe source of the packets.

However, this chapter leaves the IPv6 routing protocol troubleshooting discussions until Chapters 23 and 24. Both chapters discuss specific reasons why OSPFv3 and EIGRP might fail to put a route into the IPv6 routing table. For now, keep the following two examples in mind when troubleshooting IPv6 problems.\\nTo display the specific IPv6 route a router would use to send packets to a specific destina-\\ntion address, just use the show ipv6 route address command. The command lists several \\nlines that detail the route the router will use. If the router has no matching route, the router lists a message of “Route not found.” Example 22-6 shows an example in which the matched route is a static         route that forwards packets out interface S0/0/1. It also shows an example where no route was found.\\nExample 22-6 Displaying the Router R1 Uses to Forward to 2001:DB8:1111:3::22\\nR1# show ipv6 route 2001:db8:1111:3::22\\nRouting entry for 2001:DB8:1111:3::/64\\n  Known via \"static\", distance 1, metric 0\\n  Route count is 1/1, share count 0\\n  Routing paths:    directly connected via Serial0/0/1\\nLast updated 00:01:29 ago\\nR1# show ipv6 route 2001:1:1:1::1\\n% Route not found\\nIn addition, the show ipv6 neighbors command lists the IPv6 replacement for the IPv4 \\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) table. If a ping fails, and an expected entry is missing from this table, that fact might point to an issue that is preventing NDP from discovering the neighbor’s MAC address. Example 22-7 shows this command on Router R2 from         Figure 22-12, listing PC2’s IPv6 and matching MAC address.\\nExample 22-7 The show ipv6 neighbors Command on Router R2\\nR2# show ipv6 neighbors\\nIPv6 Address Age Link-layer Addr State Interface\\nFE80::11FF:FE11:1111 0 0200.1111.1111  STALE Gi0/0\\nFE80::22FF:FE22:2222 1 0200.2222.2222  STALE Gi0/0\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::22 0 0200.2222.2222  REACH Gi0/0\\nFE80::D68C:B5FF:FE7D:8200 1 d48c.b57d.8200  DELAY Gi0/0\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::33 0 0200.1111.1111  REACH Gi0/0\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::3 0 d48c.b57d.8200  REACH Gi0/0\\nptg17396363604  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTroubleshooting IPv6\\nImagine that you work with a medium-sized enterprise network that uses IPv6. It works \\nwell, you go home on time every day, and life is good. Then one day you go to work and get a text about a problem with the network. So, what do you do? You try some com-mands, try to isolate the problem, and eventually, find the root cause   of the problem. For example, maybe a user had a problem and a co-worker “helped” and configured that user’s PC with static IPv6 settings and made a typo in the default router IPv6 address.\\nThe rest of this chapter presents seven different IPv6 troubleshooting scenarios, as if an \\nengineer had just started working a problem. Each problem assumes that the engineer has determined that the problem exists in a particular part of the network or for a particular set of reasons.\\nEach scenario then gives us a place to talk about potential root causes that happen to show \\nup with a particular set of symptoms and to review the whys and wherefores behind those symptoms.\\nBefore getting into the specific scenarios, the following three lists break down some impor-\\ntant facts that should be true about a working IPv6 network. Many of the root causes of problems in this section of the chapter happen because one of these rules was broken.\\nHost-Focused Issues\\n1. Hosts should be in the same IPv6 subnet as their    default router.\\n2. Hosts should use the same prefix length as their default router.\\n3. Hosts should have a default router setting that points to a real router’s address.\\n4. Hosts should have correct Domain Name Service (DNS) server addresses.\\nRouter-Focused Issues\\n1. Router interfaces in use should be in an up/up state.\\n2. Two routers that connect    to the same data link should have addresses in the same\\nIPv6 subnet.\\n3. Routers should have IPv6 routes to all IPv6 subnets as per the IPv6 subnet design.\\nFiltering Issues\\n1. Watch for MAC address filtering    on the LAN switches.\\n2. Watch for missing VLANs in switches.\\n3. Watch for IPv6 access control lists (ACL) in routers.\\nBefore diving into the scenarios, if you stop and think about these lists, all the items apply \\nin concept to both IPv4 and IPv6. So, the IPv6 troubleshooting process and concepts should mirror IPv4 to some degree. Of course, the specifics do differ, and these scenarios bring out those differences as well.\\nNow on to a variety of IPv6 problem symptoms!\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  605\\nPings from the Host Work Only in Some Cases\\nOur network engineer has responded to a new problem request by calling the user. The \\nengineer asks the user to do some IPv6 ping commands     from the user’s PC. Some pings actually work, but some do not. What should he try next?\\nFrankly, at this point, if you ask that same question to ten experienced network engineers, \\nyou would probably get five or six different suggested next steps. But one highly produc-tive next step when a host gets some pings to work and some do not work is to check the host’s IPv6 settings.\\nThe static IPv6 settings on a host can be one of the most common places to find a mistake, \\nand some of those mistakes result in the “some pings work, some do not” symptom. First, the numbers are long and easy to mistype. Second, you have to make sure that you under-stand what has to match on the router and DNS server, as well. Finally, for exams, the peo-ple writing the exam questions have a lot of small settings to change to make new questions, so it is easy to create a new question by just editing a drawing and changing one number. So, just as with IPv4, you need to be ready to check IPv6 host settings.\\nFigure 22-13 collects all the pieces that should match. The concepts mirror the same con-\\ncepts in IPv4.\\nDNS1\\nAddress\\nDNS2Address\\nG0/0\\nAddressDNS\\nA\\nR11\\nDefault Router2\\nPrefix Length Prefix Length\\nMath Math34\\nAddress + Length\\nPrefix &\\nPrefix Length4\\nFigure 22-13 Host IPv6 Settings Compared to What the Settings Should Match\\nNext, think about the symptoms of the ping tests, assuming one, but only one, of these set-\\ntings is wrong. (If more than one setting is wrong, it makes the symptoms harder to describe here.) Here is a walkthrough of the settings     numbered in the figure:\\n1. With the DNS setting as the one incorrect setting, pings that refer to a hostname will\\nfail, but pings to an IPv6 address should work (again assuming no other problems\\nexist).\\n2. With the default router setting as the only incorrect setting, pings based on an IPv6\\naddress in the local LAN should work. However, pings to addresses outside the sub-net (that therefore use the default router) fail. Also, because name resolution wouldfail, all pings that use names would also fail.\\nptg17396363606  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n3. If the prefix lengths do not match, the host and router disagree about the subnet on\\nthe LAN (see the next step).\\n4. If the host and router disagree about what IPv6 subnet exists on the VLAN, the rout-\\ners might not be able to route packets back to the host. As a result, the same ping\\nsymptoms as Step 2 occur.\\nFrom an exam-taking perspective, you want to work through these symptoms as fast as pos-\\nsible. So, if the question gives you the host settings, check them against the router interface address and prefix length and the DNS server address info, because doing so should take only a little time.\\nFrom the perspective of troubleshooting for your job, these symptoms reduce to basically \\ntwo sets of symptoms:\\n■Pings that use names happen to fail\\n■Pings that require off-subnet packets happen to fail\\nFor these two sets of symptoms, the first case points to some     DNS problem, and the second points to either a default router issue or a mismatched subnet issue.\\nPings Fail from a Host to Its Default Router\\nNow, on to a second scenario. The engineer has checked out a problem with commands on the host and on that host’s default router. All the IPv6 settings on the host and the default router look good. However, when the user at the host pings     faraway servers, the pings, both by name and by IPv6 address, fail.\\nAs a next step, the network engineer tries to narrow down the scope a bit with some local \\npings. The engineer asks the user to just ping from the host to the default router IPv6 address. This ping fails, as well. The engineer tries the reverse—a ping from the default router to the host—and it fails as well.\\nTo summarize, the host cannot ping its default router or vice versa. With these initial \\nproblem symptoms, the question is this: What possible root causes would result in these symptoms? For instance, in Figure 22-14, what prevents host B from pinging Router R3, particularly after you rule out the host and router IPv6 settings?\\nA BG0/1Router G0/1 Is\\nNot Up/Up—Look Here\\nF0/1\\nSW1\\nSW3\\nESW5\\nC DSW2\\nSW4R2 R3Router G0/1 Is\\nUp/Up—Look Here\\nFigure 22-14 Where to Look for Problems Based on Router LAN Interface Status\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  607\\nTo find the problem, the engineer needs to start thinking outside the IPv6 world and start \\nthinking about the LAN between the host and the router. In particular, the probable     root causes can be broken down into these categories:\\n1. The router or host LAN interface is administratively disabled.\\n2. The LAN has some problem that prevents the flow of Ethernet frames.\\n3. The LAN has filtering (for example, port security) that filters the Ethernet frames.\\nFirst, the router and host can be disabled. Routers, of course, use the shutdown interface \\nsubcommand; if R3’s G0/1 were shut down at this point, the engineer would have seen the ping results described for this scenario. Hosts also have ways to disable and enable their interfaces, which again would result in this same set of ping symptoms. The solution? Use a no shutdown command on the router or enable the interface on the host.\\nAs for the second problem in the list, Part I of this book has already discussed LAN prob-\\nlems at length. However, as a troubleshooting tip, note that if R3’s G0/1 interface is in a down/down state, a LAN problem would likely exist on the Ethernet link directly con-nected to R3’s G0/1 interface. However, if R3’s G0/1 is in an up/up state, any LAN problem probably exists elsewhere in the LAN itself. If the ping still does not work, review the infor-mation covered in Chapter 4, “LAN Troubleshooting.”\\nAs for the third problem in the list, it could be that some filtering mechanism, like port \\nsecurity, is purposefully filtering the frames sent by the host (B) or the router (R3 G0/1). Also, Router R3 could have an inbound IPv6 ACL on its G0/1 interface, one that unfortu-nately filtered inbound ICMPv6 packets, which would discard the incoming packets gener-ated     by the ping commands. (Note that upcoming Chapter 25, “IPv6 Access Control Lists,” \\ndiscusses IPv6 ACLs.)\\nProblems Using Any Function That Requires DNS\\nMoving on to the third unique troubleshooting scenario, our engineer is troubleshooting a problem for host C. A ping from host C to a Server1 by hostname fails, but a ping to Server1’s IPv6 address succeeds. The engineer      tries another similar test, pinging another server (Server2), with the same results: The ping to the hostname fails, and the ping to the IPv6 address works.\\nThese symptoms pretty clearly point to “some kind of name resolution problem.” However, \\nthat does not define the specific root cause that the engineer can go fix to get the user working again. In this case, the root causes could fall into these categories:\\n1. An incorrect host DNS server setting, as statically defined on the host\\n2. An incorrect host DNS server setting, as learned with (stateless or stateful) DHCPv6\\n3. An IPv6 connectivity problem between the user’s host and the DNS server\\nAs for the first root cause listed here, if the host’s DNS server setting is wrong, the host sends the DNS requests to the wrong destination address. As a result, the host gets no DNS response and does not learn the IPv6 address of the destination host. The root cause? Someone typed the wrong information into the host IPv6 configuration settings.\\nThe second root cause in the list is similar to the first, but different enough to be worth \\nhaving a second category. The user’s computer has an incorrect DNS server setting, but that \\nptg17396363608  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nsetting was learned using DHCPv6. Basically, you have the same problem symptoms but a \\ndifferent root cause. As a reminder, both with stateful DHCPv6 and with SLAAC, the host learns the DNS addresses using DHCPv6.\\nThe third root cause requires a little more discussion and an example. The example shows \\nhost C in Figure 22-15, with the two-step process that happens the first time the host tests Server1 with a ping Server1 command. First, IPv6 packets must flow from host C to the DNS server and back for the purpose of      name resolution. At Step 2 in the figure, IPv6 pack-ets can flow to Server1’s IPv6 address.\\nC1\\n2DNS Server\\n2001:DB8:2:2::2\\nServer12001:DB8:1:1::1Route has Failed!\\nFigure 22-15 DNS Name Resolution Before Forwarding the Packet to the Server\\nDepending on the topology in the cloud, a connectivity problem may exist between host C \\nand the DNS server, whereas no such problem exists between host C and Server1. So, when the problem symptoms point to a “name resolution is not working” set of symptoms, but the host appears to point to the right DNS server addresses, start      looking at basic IPv6 con-nectivity from the host to the DNS server.\\nHost Is Missing IPv6 Settings: Stateful DHCP Issues\\nTurning the page to yet another new scenario, our network engineer is now working a prob-lem for a user of a host D. The engineer has called and asked the user to issue a few com-mands, and the engineer has determined that the host is      trying to dynamically learn its IPv6 settings and that the host does not have an IPv6 unicast address yet.\\nFor the sake of discussion, assume that this network uses a strategy of assigning IPv6 \\naddresses using DHCPv6. The engineer knows this strategy, so the engineer is already won-dering why the process failed. This scenario walks through some potential root causes of straightforward mistakes.\\nNOTE This book leaves out some details of what happens in the process of how a host is told whether to use SLAAC or stateful DHCPv6. To keep the discussion clean and in scope of the topics in this book, assume that for this discussion only stateful DHCP is in use.\\nStateful IPv6 DHCP troubleshooting follows the same basic logic as for IPv4 DHCP, as discussed in Chapter 21, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing,” in the “DHCP Issues” section. So, reiterating a few concepts from that chapter, the following must be true for an IPv6 host to successfully use either stateful or stateless DHCPv6 to learn information from a DHCPv6 server:\\n1. The server must be in the same subnet as the client.\\nOr\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  609\\n2. The server may be in a different subnet, with\\na. The router that sits on the same subnet as the client host correctly implementing\\nDHCP relay\\nb. IPv6 connectivity working between that local router (the router near the client\\nhost) and the DHCPv6 server\\nThe two most likely root causes of a host failing to dynamically learn its IPv6 settings with \\nstateful DHCPv6 are root causes 2A and 2B. For 2A, the solution requires a configuration command on the correct interface on each LAN that is remote from the DHCPv6 server. For instance, in Figure 22-16, host D sits on a LAN subnet on the left, with R1’s G0/0 inter-face connected to the same subnet. R1 should have the command listed at the bottom      of the figure to enable the IPv6 DHCP relay function pointing to the DHCPv6 server on the right.\\nB D\\nDHCPv6 Server\\nipv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:DB8:1111:3::8G0/0 R1R2\\nS1\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::8\\nFigure 22-16 IPv6 DHCP Relay\\nIf R1 is missing the ipv6 dhcp relay command or points to the wrong IPv6 address, host D’s attempt to use DHCPv6 will fail.\\nThe item listed as 2B is not actually a root      cause. Instead, it is just another problem symp-\\ntom that needs further investigation. Connectivity must exist between R1 and the DHCPv6 server, and back to the address R1 uses to source the DHCPv6 message. (R1 sources the DHCPv6 request from the outgoing interface of the sent message, not necessarily the same interface where the ipv6 dhcp relay command is configured; in this case, R1 would use its serial interface IPv6 address.) A good test of this problem is to ping the DHCPv6 server’s IPv6 address from R1.\\nHost Is Missing IPv6 Settings: SLAAC Issues\\nFor the fifth troubleshooting scenario, take the previous scenario but assume the enter-prise uses SLAAC rather than stateful DHCPv6 for IPv6 address assignment. To review, the engineer has discovered that host D has     not learned its IPv6 address. So, what could cause SLAAC to fail? This next topic explores the potential root causes.\\nTo understand some of the root causes for such a problem, first review the three steps a \\nhost takes when using SLAAC to learn and build its IPv6 settings:\\n1. Use NDP to learn the prefix, prefix length, and default router address from a router\\non the same subnet.\\n2. Use SLAAC rules, locally on the host (no network messages required), to build the\\nhost’s own IPv6 address.\\n3. Use stateless DHCPv6 to learn the addresses of the DNS servers from a DHCPv6\\nserver.\\nptg17396363610  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe first of these steps uses the NDP Router Solicitation (RS) message, with     the router send-\\ning back an NDP Router Advertisement (RA) message, as shown in Figure 22-17. The RS message, sent to the all IPv6 routers multicast address FF02::2, should go to all IPv6 routers on the same VLAN as host D in the figure. In this case, R1 replies, listing R1’s IPv6 address (to be used as D’s default router) and the prefix/length host D should use.\\nAll Routers—Identity YourselvesRSR1D\\n1\\nRouter: 2001:DB8:1111:1::1RA 2(To FF02::2)\\nPrefix/Length: 2001:DB8:1111:1:: /64ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1111:1::1/64\\nFigure 22-17 NDP RS and RA Process\\nHosts that use SLAAC rely on the information in the RA message. So, when a host fails to learn and build these three settings when using SLAAC, including the IPv6 address, the next question really should be this: What could cause the     NDP RS/RA process to fail? The fol-lowing list details these potential root causes:\\n1. No LAN connectivity between the host and any router in the subnet.\\n2. The router is missing an ipv6 address interface subcommand.\\n3. The router is missing an ipv6 unicast-routing global configuration command.\\nOf these reasons, the first is somewhat obvious. If the LAN cannot forward Ethernet frames from the host to the router, or vice versa, the NDP RS and RA messages cannot be deliv-ered.\\nAs for the second reason, to respond to an RS message, a router must have an ipv6 address \\ncommand. This command enables IPv6 on the interface, but it also defines the information \\nthat the router will list in the RA message. For instance, in Figure 22-17, R1 has been config-ured with the ipv6 address 2001:db8:1111:1::1/64 command. This command directly lists two of the pieces of information R1 supplies in the RA message, and R1 uses     the address and prefix length to calculate the IPv6 prefix as well.\\nThe third root cause in the list may be the most surprising: The router must enable IPv6 \\nrouting with the ipv6 unicast-routing global command. Why? Without this command, Cisco routers do not try to route IPv6 packets. If omitted, the router does not consider itself an IPv6 router and does not reply to the NDP RS message with an RA.\\nTraceroute Shows Some Hops, But Fails\\nThis chapter’s sixth different troubleshooting scenario now moves away from the host and toward the routers, leading toward IPv6 routing issues.\\nptg1739636322Chapter 22: IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting  611\\nIn this case, the engineer    hears that a host cannot connect to a server. Clearly, a ping from \\nthe host to the server fails, so the engineer does several of the steps discussed already in this chapter and finds the following:\\n■The host IPv6 settings look good.\\n■The host IPv6 settings match the default router and DNS server as they should.\\n■The host can ping its default router.\\nTo continue troubleshooting, the engineer next calls the user and asks him to try a traceroute command with a destination of the server’s IPv6 address. The traceroute shows a \\ncouple of routers in the output, but then the command never completes   until interrupted by the user. What could the root causes be? Usually, but not always, these symptoms point to some kind of an IPv6 routing problem. For the next page or two, this discussion examines some potential root causes for these routing problems.\\nRouting problems happen for many reasons. Some routing problems happen because routes \\nare missing from a router (perhaps because of many specific root causes). Some routing problems happen because a router has an incorrect route. The following list gives just some of the reasons why a router might be missing a needed route or might have an incorrect route:\\n■Links between routers are down.\\n■Routing protocol neighbor problems exist.\\n■Routing protocol route filtering prevents the route from being added to the IPv6 routing\\ntable.\\n■Incorrect static routes send packets to the wrong next router.\\n■Poor subnet design duplicates subnets in different locations in the network, falsely\\nadvertising a subnet.\\nFor example, take a look at Figure 22-18. Host A fails when attempting to ping host C, which sits in subnet 33 (2001:DB8:1:33::/64). A traceroute of host C from host A lists R1’s and R2’s IPv6 addresses, but then it never finishes.\\nSubnet “33”\\n2001:DB8:1:33::/64\\nIncorrect Static Route!R1A\\nR2B\\nR3C\\n1\\n2To Subnet “33”\\nTo Subnet “33”\\nFigure 22-18 Incorrect Static Route Creates Routing Loop\\nptg17396363612  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAs you can see from the notes in the figure, the routing problem exists because of an incor-\\nrect static route on R2. Host A can forward IPv6 packets to R1, its default router. R1 can correctly forward packets sent to host C to router R2. However, R2 has an incorrect static route for subnet 33 pointing back to R1.\\nAs for other root causes of routing problems, take the list and look for those issues as well. \\nCheck the interfaces on routers that should be up to make sure the interfaces still work. Do troubleshooting for your routing protocol. (Chapters 23 and 24 discuss how to trouble-shoot OSPFv3 and EIGRP, respectively.) And even look for the possibility that someone misconfigured a router interface, so that the routing protocols advertise about the same subnet number as existing in two places, which breaks design rules on paper and confuses the routing    of packets to hosts in that IPv6 subnet.\\nRouting Looks Good, But Traceroute Still Fails\\nTo finish this set of scenarios, this last scenario     focuses on one particular root cause: IPv6 access control lists (ACL).\\nYou have already learned how ping and traceroute commands can imply that a routing \\nproblem may exist. When ping and traceroute show that the host can forward a packet at least as far as the default router but not all the way to the destination, the problem probably sits in one of these two categories:\\n■A routing problem exists.\\n■Routing works, but some filter, like an IPv6 ACL, is discarding the packets.\\nIPv6 ACLs use some of the same general concepts as IPv4 ACLs, but of course, they filter IPv6 packets rather than IPv4 packets. IPv6 ACL configuration defines a list of statements, with each statement matching source and destination IPv6 address ranges, port numbers, and so on. You can enable the ACL to filter IPv6 packets as they flow in or out of an inter-face.\\nChapter 25 shows the details for how to configure and verify IPv6 ACLs. As always, when \\ntroubleshooting a packet-forwarding issue, always check for     ACLs that could be filtering the packets.\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

IPv6 needed routing protocols. One solu-tion was to create a new version of OSPF: OSPF Version 3 (OSPFv3). The original OSPFv3 RFC defined a routing protocol to advertise IPv6 routes, using  many similar concepts as compared to OSPFv2, but with of course some differences.\\nBecause OSPFv2 (for IPv4) and OSPFv3 (for IPv6) have many similarities, you already know \\na lot about OSPFv3 from earlier Chapters 7, 8, and 11 of this book. This chapter takes advantage of those similarities to help you learn OSPFv3 more quickly.\\nThis chapter uses three major sections. The first major section of the chapter, which is \\nrather short, works through a few details about terminology and the history of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. Then the chapter moves on to the section about OSPFv3 configuration, with many details similar to OSPFv2 interface configuration. For the most part, this second section will look very similar to the OSPFv2 configuration you saw in Chapter 8, “Implementing OSPF for IPv4,” except that OSPFv3 does not use a network command in OSPF configuration mode; it uses interface configuration instead.\\nThe last major section of the chapter pulls many OSPFv3 concepts together with trouble-\\nshooting concepts and by showing verification commands. Many of these commands will look familiar from the earlier OSPFv2 chapters. The section points out the differences in command output compared to OSPFv2. At the same time, the discussion includes a list of common root causes of OSPFv3 problems and explains how to recognize those problems.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

So, rather than repeat every detail, this first major section of the chapter begins by describing OSPFv3 expecting that you already know quite a bit about OSPFv2. These next few pages begin with some background information about routing protocols used for IPv6, and OSPFv3 in particular. This section ends with a long list of similarities between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, which gives you a great start for learning OSPFv3.\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  619\\nIPv6 Routing Protocol Versions and Protocols\\nFirst, when most engineers refer to “OSPF,” they are likely referring to OSPF as used with \\nIPv4, and specifically, OSPF Version 2 (OSPFv2). To appreciate why, consider a few branch-es of the history of OSPF.\\nOnce, there was an       OSPF version 1 (OSPFv1), but OSPFv2 followed soon afterward (with \\nthe original OSPFv2 RFC dated 1991). When OSPF became widely used as an IPv4 routing protocol, back in the early to mid-1990s, OSPFv2 was already defined, and the router ven-dors used OSPFv2 and not OSPFv1. So, even in the early days of OSPF, there was no need for people to talk about whether they used OSPFv1 or OSPFv2; everyone used OSPFv2, and they just called it OSPF.\\nNext, consider the timeline for the development of the original   IPv6 protocols, also back in \\nearly to mid-1990s. The introduction of IPv6 meant that many other protocols needed to be updated to make IPv6 work: ICMP, TCP, UDP, and so on, including OSPF. When a work-ing group updated OSPF to support IPv6, what did they call it? OSPF version 3, of course. Figure 23-1 shows those events on the left and center of the timeline, with OSPFv3 first reaching RFC status in 1999.\\nOSPFv3\\nAddress Families\\n(Both)2010\\nOSPFv3\\n(IPv6)1999\\nOSPFv2\\n(IPv4)1991\\n1990 2000 2010\\nFigure 23-1 Timeline of OSPF Standards\\nFor a little over 10 years, the OSPF version story could be told easily in one sentence. You used OSPFv2 to advertise IPv4 routes, and OSPFv3 to advertise IPv6 routes. In fact, OSPFv2 could advertise only IPv4 routes, with OSPFv3 supporting only IPv6 routes. \\nThis particular story continued to change. Again based on RFC dates, in 2010, OSPFv3 \\nadded support for IPv4 through       a feature called address families. Basically, if you want to run dual stack (that is, both IPv4 and IPv6 on your routers), then you can run OSPFv3 with address families. You treat IPv4 as one address family, IPv6 as another, but each router has one OSPFv3 routing protocol process. With these new features, now OSPFv3 supports the advertisement of both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.\\nTwo Options for Implementing Dual Stack with OSPF\\nAs previously indicated, dual stack means that routers support both IPv4 and IPv6. To implement dual stack, each router needs to learn both IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For many years, the OSPF solution for dual stack was clear: Run both     OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 on all routers, as shown in Figure 23-2.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 C, E 2 B 3 B 4 B 5 A, D, E 6 B, D 7 C\\nptg17396363620  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nLSDBOSPFv2 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBOSPFv3 Config\\nSPFLSDBOSPFv2 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBOSPFv3 Config\\nSPFLSDBOSPFv2 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBOSPFv3 Config\\nSPFR1 R2 R3\\nMessages\\nNeighbors\\nMessagesNeighborsMessagesNeighbors\\nMessages\\nNeighbors\\nFigure 23-2 Conceptual View of OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Dual Stack\\nNote that although OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 have similar internals, they act as completely sepa-\\nrate processes with separate messages. That is, the OSPFv2 process on Router R1 does not communicate with the OSPFv3 process. They have separate link-state databases (LSDB). They send separate messages, as noted with the dashed lines in the figure.\\nNow that OSPFv3 address families exist in IOS, you can also support dual-stack implemen-\\ntations by running OSPFv3 only, and configuring it to support the IPv4 address family in addition to the IPv6 address family. However, as seen in Figure 23-3, the router would still have a separate LSDB for IPv4 and IPv6 routes, separate SPF    calculations, with separate neighbor relationships and separate OSPF messages between the routers.\\nLSDBIPv4 AFOSPFv3 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBIPv6 AF\\nSPFLSDBIPv4 AFOSPFv3 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBIPv6 AF\\nSPFLSDBIPv4 AFOSPFv3 Config\\nSPF\\nLSDBIPv6 AF\\nSPFR1 R2 R3\\nMessages\\nNeighbors\\nMessages\\nNeighborsMessagesNeighbors\\nMessages\\nNeighbors\\nFigure 23-3 Conceptual View of OSPFv3 Address Families Dual Stack\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  621\\nOSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Internals\\nTo the depth that this book discusses OSPF theory and concepts, OSPFv3 acts very much \\nlike OSPFv2. For example, both use link-state logic. Both use the same metric. And the list keeps getting longer, because the protocols do have many similarities. The following list notes many of the similarities for    the features discussed both in this chapter and in Chapter 7, “Understanding OSPF Concepts”:\\n■Both are link-state protocols.\\n■Both use the same area design concepts and design terms.\\n■Both require that the routing protocol be enabled on an interface.\\n■Once enabled on an interface, both then attempt to discover neighbors connected to the\\ndata link connected to an interface.\\n■Both perform a check of certain settings before a router will become neighbors with\\nanother router (the list of checks is slightly different between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3).\\n■After two routers become neighbors, both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 proceed by exchanging\\nthe contents of their LSDB—the link-state advertisements (LSA) that describe the net-\\nwork topology—between the two neighbors.\\n■After all the LSAs have been exchanged, both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 use the shortest path\\nfirst (SPF) algorithm to calculate the best route to each subnet.\\n■Both use the same metric concept, based on the interface cost of each interface, with the\\nsame default cost values.\\n■Both use LSAs to describe the topology, with some differences in how LSAs work.\\nThe biggest differences between OSPFv3 and the older OSPFv2 pertain to their inter-\\nnals. OSPFv3 changes the structure of some OSPF LSAs, and    adds some new LSA types. However, these differences sit outside the scope of this book. \\nNow that you have a general idea about the similarities and differences between OSPFv3 \\nand OSPFv2, the rest of this section shows examples of how to configure and verify OSPFv3. Note that for the rest of the chapter, all references to classic OSPFv3 refers to using OSPFv3 without using the address family configuration feature.\\nOSPFv3 Configuration\\nRemember how to configure OSPFv2 using interface configuration? OSPFv3 configuration follows that same interface configuration model. In fact, most of the commands have either similar syntax, replacing ip with ipv6, or the exact same syntax.\\nThis second of three major sections focuses on OSPFv3 configuration. It begins with the \\nbasics, and then folds in many of the optional configuration topics, like setting OSPF costs, load balancing, and injecting default routes.\\nBasic OSPFv3 Configuration\\nAs a first step, review the following    OSPFv3 configuration checklist. It details the required configuration steps, plus a few optional steps. If you read it too quickly, you might not even notice the small differences for OSPFv3 versus OSPFv2—the configuration is that similar. \\nptg17396363622  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStep 1. Use the ipv6 router ospf process-id global command to create an OSPFv3 \\nprocess number and enter OSPF configuration mode for that process.\\nStep 2.

(Optional) Use the passive-interface type number router subcommand to \\nconfigure any OSPFv3 interfaces as passive if no neighbors can or should be discovered on the interface.\\nTo get a better understanding of these basic commands, and to contrast them with their \\nOSPFv2 cousins, this configuration section uses a multiarea configuration example with the exact same internetwork topology as the multiarea example shown in Chapter 8.\\nFigure 23-4 begins to describe the design, before getting into the configuration, showing \\nthe IPv6 subnets. The figure does not show the individual router IPv6 addresses, to reduce clutter, but to make the addresses easier to recognize, the addresses all end with the same number as the router. For example, all five of Router R1’s interface addresses     end with 1.\\n2001:DB8:1:\\n14/64R3 R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/02001:DB8:1: 1/642001:DB8:1:12/642001:DB8:1: 23/64\\n2001:DB8:1: 4/642001:DB8:1: 2/64G0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/12001:DB8:1:13/64\\nFigure 23-4 Internetwork for an Example Multiarea OSPFv3 Configuration\\nFigure 23-5 next shows the OSPFv3 area design. For those of you with an excellent memo-\\nry, the design is identical to Chapter 8’s Figure 8-8, which defined the area design for that chapter’s multiarea design example. The design makes R2 and R3 internal routers inside area 23, R4 an internal router inside area 4, and R1 an Area Border Router (ABR) connected      to all three areas.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  623\\nArea 4R3R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/0Area 0Area 23\\nG0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/1\\nFigure 23-5 Area Design for the Multiarea OSPFv3 Example\\nSingle-Area Configuration on the Three Internal Routers\\nThe configurations on the three internal routers       in this example review ICND1-level single-\\narea OSPF configuration. In a multiarea OSPF design, the configuration on any internal routers—routers for which all interfaces connect to a single area—looks like a single-area configuration because all the interfaces are placed into one area.\\nExample 23-1 begins the example with R2’s complete IPv6 configuration, including \\nOSPFv3. In other words, all the commands needed on R2 to add IPv6 support are in the example. Note that for OSPFv3 in particular, the example shows the following actions, as highlighted in the example:\\n1. Creates an OSPFv3 process with process ID 2\\n2. Defines the OSPFv3 RID explicitly as 2.2.2.2\\n3. Enables OSPFv3 process 2 on two interfaces, putting both in area 23\\nExample 23-1 IPv6 and OSPFv3 Configuration on Internal Router R2\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n mac-address 0200.0000.0002\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:23::2/64 ipv6 ospf 2 area 23\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:12::2/64 ipv6 ospf 2 area 23\\n!\\nipv6 router ospf 2\\n router-id 2.2.2.2\\nptg17396363624  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFirst, focus on the two commands that should be in every OSPFv3 configuration: the  ipv6 \\nrouter ospf process-id global command and the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface \\nsubcommand. The first command creates     the OSPFv3 process by number. The second com-\\nmand, one per interface, enables that OSPFv3 process on the interface and assigns the area number. In this case, R2 has a process ID of 2, with both interfaces assigned to area 23.\\nNext, consider one completely optional feature: OSPFv3 passive interfaces. This feature \\nuses the same concepts and literally       the exact same command syntax as OSPFv2. If a router should not form neighbor relationships on an interface, that interface may be made passive. In this case, R2 should find at least one OSPFv3 neighbor on each of its two interfaces, so the configuration does not include the passive-interface command at all.\\nFinally, OSPFv3 follows the exact same rules as OSPFv2 when setting the OSPFv3 router ID \\n(RID). The OSPFv3 RID is a 32-bit number, often written in dotted decimal, so it looks like an IPv4 address. The OSPFv3 RID is not a 12-bit number that is then represented to look like an IPv6 address. In this case, R2 sets its RID using the OSPFv3 router-id command, but            \\nyou should be ready to configure all three ways.\\nNow on to the configuration on R3, which should have a very similar OSPFv3 configuration \\ncompared to R2. Both are internal routers in area 23, and both have at least one neighbor off their two interfaces, respectively, so neither can make either of their interfaces passive. Also, just to make the point that OSPFv3 neighbors may use different PID values, R3 uses OSPFv3 PID 3, while R2 uses PID 2.

First, R4 can make its G0/1 interface passive because R4 expects to create no OSPFv3 neighbor relationships off that LAN interface. R4 also uses       a different OSPFv3 PID.\\nNOTE Although these examples use different OSPFv3 PIDs, to show that such a choice causes no problems, most enterprises would use the same PID value on all routers for con-sistency.\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  625\\nExample 23-3 IPv6 and OSPFv3 Configuration on R4\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n mac-address 0200.0000.0004\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:14::4/64 ipv6 ospf 4 area 4\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:4::4/64 ipv6 ospf 4 area 4\\n!\\nipv6 router ospf 4\\n router-id 4.4.4.4\\n passive-interface gigabitethernet0/1\\nAdding Multiarea Configuration on the Area Border Router\\nThe configuration for multiarea OSPF         is just as anticlimactic for OSPFv3 as it was for \\nOSPFv2. Multiarea OSPF may lead to some interesting design discussions when deciding which links to put in which areas. Once decided, the configuration is just a matter of read-ing the documentation correctly and typing the correct area number into the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommand.\\nIn this example, ABR R1 has an OSPFv3 process (PID 1), with OSPFv3 enabled on five interfaces, as follows, to match earlier Figure 23-5:\\nArea 0: G0/0.11 and G0/0.12\\nArea 23: S0/0/0 and S0/0/1Area 4: G0/1\\nTo be clear, nothing in R1’s configuration mentions multiarea or ABR—R1 simply acts as an \\nABR because its configuration puts some interfaces in area 0 and       others in other nonback-bone areas. Example 23-4 shows the configuration.\\nExample 23-4 IPv6 and OSPFv3 Configuration on ABR R1\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n mac-address 0200.0000.0001\\n!interface GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n encapsulation dot1q 11\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:1::1/64\\n ipv6 ospf 1 area 0!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\nptg17396363626  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n encapsulation dot1q 12\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:2::1/64\\n ipv6 ospf 1 area 0\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1 ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:14::1/64\\n ipv6 ospf 1 area 4\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/0 ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:12::1/64\\n ipv6 ospf 1 area 23\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1 ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:13::1/64\\n ipv6 ospf 1 area 23\\n!\\nipv6 router ospf 1\\n router-id 1.1.1.1\\nOther OSPFv3 Configuration Settings\\nThe next few short configuration topics take some other OSPFv2 features discussed back in \\nChapter 8 and show how to configure those for OSPFv3. And as usual, the details are nearly identical.\\nSetting OSPFv3 Interface Cost to Influence Route Selection\\nOSPFv3 works much like OSPFv2 in how it calculates the metric for a route, with some slight differences with the concepts, configuration commands, and verification commands.\\nTo review the concepts, as discussed back in Chapters 7 and 8, SPF on a router finds all pos-\\nsible routes for a subnet. Then, it adds the OSPF interface cost for all outgoing interfaces in a route to calculate the metric for each route. It then chooses the route with the lowest metric as the best route, which is then added to the IP routing table.\\nFor instance, Figure 23-6 repeats        a figure from Chapter 7 (Figure 7-11), changed slightly to \\nnow show an IPv6 subnet. The figure shows a single-area design in which R1 finds three pos-sible routes to reach subnet 33 (2001:DB8:1:33::/64), the middle route having the lowest cost.\\nTo influence the metric for the route, OSPFv3 gives us a few ways to change an interface’s \\nOSPFv3 cost, with the same basic rules as OSPFv2, as summarized in this list:\\n1. Set the cost explicitly using the ipv6 ospf cost x interface subcommand to a value\\nbetween 1 and 65,535, inclusive.\\n2. Change the interface bandwidth with the bandwidth speed command, with speed\\nbeing a number in kilobits per second (Kbps), and let the router calculate the value\\nbased on the OSPFv3 reference-bandwidth / interface-bandwidth.\\n3. Change the reference bandwidth with router OSPFv3 subcommand auto-cost\\nreference-bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits        per second (Mbps).\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  627\\nCost 20\\nCost 30Cost 30 Cost 10\\nCost 60\\nCost 20 Cost 180\\nCost 5\\nCost 10\\nSubnet 33\\n(2001:DB8:1:33::/64)Cost 40\\nPossible RouteR1\\nR2\\nR3 R7\\nR4R5\\nR6\\nR8Legend:\\nFigure 23-6 SPF Tree to Find R1’s Route to 2001:DB8:1:33::/64\\nOSPF Load Balancing\\nOSPFv3 and OSPFv2 follow the same concept, with the exact same configuration com-\\nmand, to effect equal-cost load balancing.\\nWhen OSPFv3     on a router calculates multiple equal-metric routes to reach one subnet, the \\nrouter can put multiple equal-cost routes in the routing table. The OSPFv3 maximum-paths number router   subcommand defines just how many such routes OSPFv3 will add to the IPv6 routing table. For example, if an internetwork has six possible routes for some subnet, and all have the exact same metric, and the engineer wants all routes to be used, he could configure the router with the maximum-paths 6 subcommand under the ipv6 router ospf command.\\nInjecting Default Routes\\nFinally, with yet another OSPFv3 feature      that works very much like OSPFv2, OSPFv3 sup-ports a router’s capability to advertise a default route with OSPFv3. This function allows one router to have a default route and then basically tell all other routers, “Hey, if you need a default route, send packets to me, and I’ll send them with my good default route.”\\nOne classic case for using a routing protocol to advertise a default route has to do with an \\nenterprise’s connection to the Internet. If a company has one IPv6-enabled Internet connec-tion, that one router can use a default IPv6 route to route all IPv6 Internet traffic out that one link. But the rest of the enterprise’s routers need to send their Internet traffic to this one router, so the enterprise engineer uses these design goals:\\n■All routers learn specific routes for subnets inside the company, so a default route is not\\nneeded for destinations inside the company.\\nptg17396363628  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n■The one router that connects to the Internet has a static default IPv6 route that points all\\nIPv6 traffic (that does not match any other IPv6 route) into the Internet.\\n■All routers learn (by using OSPFv3) a default route from the Internet-facing router so\\nthat all IPv6 packets going to the Internet first go to this one router.\\nFigure 23-7 shows the ideas of how the routing information is propagated from the \\nInternet-facing router (R1) to the other routers in the company. In this case, a company connects to an ISP with its Router R1. Router R1 uses the OSPFv3   default-information \\noriginate command in OSPFv3 configuration mode; this command is literally the same command used for OSPFv2 (Step 1). As a result, R1 advertises a default route to the other OSPFv3 routers (Step 2). (The prefix for the default route with IPv6 is ::/0, with a prefix length 0, somewhat like the 0.0.0.0/0 used with IPv4.)\\ndefault-information originate\\nR1B1\\nB2\\nB3ISP1ISP2\\n221::/0\\n::/0::/0\\nFigure 23-7 Using OSPFv3 to Advertise a Default Route\\nOnce the process in Figure 23-7 completes, the three routers on the left each have a default \\nroute. Their default routes point to R1 as the next-hop router      so that all traffic destined for the Internet first goes to R1 and then out to the ISP.\\nThat completes the discussion of new configuration for OSPFv3. The next section discusses \\nOSPFv3 verification and troubleshooting.\\nOSPFv3 Verification and Troubleshooting\\nTo the depth discussed for CCNA Routing and Switching, OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 behave very much like each other. Just like the configuration of OSPFv2, using interface config is similar to OSPFv3 configuration, the OSPFv3 verification commands are also similar. Also, the types of issues that you need to troubleshoot for OSPFv3 are similar to the potential problems with OSPFv2. So, this last major section of the chapter just needs to show where OSPFv3 uses the same concepts as OSPFv2, and show where in those rare cases OSPFv3 differs from OSPFv2.\\nTo the depth discussed in these books, OSPFv3 works    much like OSPFv2 with regard to\\n■Area design and the related terms\\n■The configuration idea of enabling the routing process, per interface, for an area\\n■The neighbor discovery process with Hello messages\\n■Transitioning through neighbor states and the topology exchange process\\n■The use of full and 2-way as the normal stable state for working neighbor relationships,\\nwith other states being      either temporary or pointing to some problem with the neighbor\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  629\\n■SPF and how it uses interface cost to calculate metrics\\n■Messages being sent to reserved multicast addresses (FF02::5 for all OSPF routers, FF02::6\\nfor all DR and BDR routers), similar to OSPFv2’s use of 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6\\nSo, what is different between OSPFv3 and OSPFv2? The next list mentions a few differ-\\nences. However, note that many of the differences happen    to be outside the scope of the coverage of topics in this book.\\n■OSPFv3 neighbors do not have to have IPv6 addresses in the same IPv6 subnet, whereas\\nOSPFv2 neighbors must be in the same IPv4 subnet.\\n■They use different names for their Type 3 LSAs (called inter-area prefix LSAs in OSPFv3\\nand summary LSAs in OSPFv2).\\n■OSPFv3 introduces new LSA types not used by OSPFv2 (beyond scope of this book).\\n■The details defined inside LSA Types 1, 2, and 3 differ (beyond scope of this book).\\nAs you can see, the list of differences    is relatively short.\\nBecause of the many similarities between OSPFv3 and OSPFv2, Cisco keeps the verification \\ncommands similar, too. Figure 23-8 summarizes the OSPFv3 verification commands rela-tive to the kinds of information they show. Note that all the commands that list ipv6 can be \\nchanged to ip to create the exact syntax of the matching OSPFv2 show command.\\nipv6 ospf pid area area_id  \\nCommands\\nDiscover \\nwith Hello\\nFlood LSAs\\nSPF CalculationConfig\\nEnabled\\nInterfaces\\nRoutesLSDBNeighborsshow running-config\\nshow ipv6 protocols\\nshow ipv6 ospf interfaceshow ipv6 ospf interface type number\\nshow ipv6 ospf interface brief\\nshow ipv6 ospf neighbor\\nshow ipv6 ospf neighbor type number\\nshow ipv6 ospf database\\nshow ipv6 route\\nshow ipv6 route ospfshow ipv6 route subnet mask\\nshow ipv6 route | section subnet\\nFigure 23-8 Reference of OSPFv3 Verification Commands\\nWhen a router first brings up the OSPFv3 process, IOS reads the OSPFv3 configuration and \\nenables OSPFv3 on interfaces. So, this section begins by discussing OSPFv3 interface verifica-tion and troubleshooting. Following that, the discussion moves on to OSPFv3 neighbors, then to the OSPFv3 topology database, and finally to OSPFv3 routes added to the IPv6 routing table.\\nNOTE All the troubleshooting examples in the rest of this chapter use Routers R1, R2, R3, and R4 from the multiarea configuration example earlier in this chapter. Look back to Figures 23-4 and 23-5 for a reference to the topology and area diagrams for this network.\\nptg17396363630  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nOSPFv3 Interfaces\\nThe style of OSPFv3 configuration clearly identifies    on which interfaces the OSPFv3 pro-\\ncess should be working. The ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommand \\nbasically means “run OSPFv3 on this interface.” A quick scan of the interface in the output of the show running-config command can identify the interfaces and the area number for each.\\nThe next few pages first take a look at a few other methods of verifying OSPFv3 interfaces, \\nand then the discussion turns to some OSPFv3 interface troubleshooting tips.\\nVerifying OSPFv3 Interfaces\\nSuppose that, from studying, you have both     seen and practiced OSPFv3 configuration and you feel confident about the configuration. Then, on the exam, you happen to get a simlet question on OSPFv3. Unfortunately, like many simlet questions, the question does not let you into enable mode, so you cannot see the configuration! A show running-config com-mand plus your good configuration skills would let you answer any question, but you can-not see the config. How can you find out, for example, on which interfaces the OSPFv3 process has been enabled?\\nThree commands tell you something about interfaces enabled for OSPFv3: show ipv6 \\nprotocols, show ipv6 ospf interface brief, and show ipv6 ospf interface. All three \\ncommands       list the interfaces on which OSPFv3 has been enabled. The first two commands list the information briefly, and the third command lists many, many lines of output per interface. (If you want a quick answer, use either of the first two commands.) Note that all three of these commands list both passive and nonpassive OSPFv3 interfaces—a handy fact to know when troubleshooting neighbor issues. \\nExample 23-5 shows a sample of the show ipv6 protocols command; later, Example \\n23-6 shows samples of the show ipv6 ospf interface and show ipv6 ospf interface brief commands. Note that before gathering the output in the example, the command passive-interface gigabitethernet0/0.11 was added to R1’s OSPFv3 process. In particular, notice that the output of this command differs quite a bit from IPv4’s show ip protocols \\ncommand, but the IPv6 version does show the interfaces on which OSPFv3 is enabled.\\nExample 23-5 Verifying OSPFv3 Interfaces and Related Parameters\\nR1# show ipv6 protocols\\nIPv6 Routing Protocol is \"connected\"\\nIPv6 Routing Protocol is \"ND\"\\nIPv6 Routing Protocol is \"ospf 1\"\\n  Interfaces (Area 0):    GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\n    GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n  Interfaces (Area 4):\\n    GigabitEthernet0/1  Interfaces (Area 23):\\n    Serial0/0/1\\n    Serial0/0/0\\n  Redistribution:    None\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  631\\nAs you can see in the example, the output of the show ipv6 protocols command     lists all \\nfive OSPFv3 interfaces on Router R1, including passive interface G0/0.11.\\nTroubleshooting OSPFv3 Interfaces\\nMost troubleshooting discussions with OSPFv3 revolve around     the problems that can occur between two OSPFv3 neighbors. However, mistakes with interface subcommands can actu-ally cause many of these OSPF neighbor problems. To get the discussions started, just con-sider the problems that can occur with the interface subcommands mentioned so far in this chapter:\\n■Configuring the wrong area with the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface sub-\\ncommand prevents neighbor relationships off that interface.\\n■Making an interface passive to the OSPFv3 process prevents the local router from form-\\ning neighbor relationships off that interface.\\nFor the first item in the list, note that all OSPFv3 routers on the same data link need to be assigned to the same area. On the exam, you need to check any information about the intended area design. To find out which interfaces have been assigned to which area, use the show ipv6 ospf interface and show ipv6 ospf interface brief commands.\\nAs for the issue in making an interface passive to OSPFv3, when a neighbor relationship \\nneeds to be made out that interface, the router should not make that interface passive to OSPFv3. Note that only the show ipv6 ospf interface command   mentions which OSPFv3 interfaces happen to be passive.\\nExample 23-6 lists two commands that can be helpful for finding both of these problems. \\nBoth list area information, but only the second makes mention of an interface     being passive.\\nExample 23-6 Finding OSPFv3 Passive Interfaces on R1\\nR1# show ipv6 ospf interface brief\\nInterface    PID   Area            Intf ID    Cost  State Nbrs F/C\\nGi0/0.12     1     0 16 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/0.11     1     0 17 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/1 1     4 4 1     DR    1/1\\nSe0/0/1 1     23 7 64    P2P   1/1\\nSe0/0/0 1     23 6  64    P2P   1/1\\nR1# show ipv6 ospf interface G0/0.11\\nGigabitEthernet0/0.11 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Link Local Address FE80::FF:FE00:1, Interface ID 17\\n  Area 0, Process ID 1, Instance ID 0, Router ID 1.1.1.1\\n  Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1  Transmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1\\n  Designated Router (ID) 1.1.1.1, local address FE80::FF:FE00:1\\n  No backup designated router on this network\\n  Timer intervals configured, Hello 10, Dead 40, Wait 40, Retransmit 5    No Hellos (Passive interface)\\n! remaining lines omitted for brevity\\nptg17396363632  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinally, to see an example of one of the problems, take another look at the configuration \\nfor Router R4. For the correct configuration in Example 23-3, the engineer made LAN interface G0/1 passive because no other routers existed on that LAN. However, note that R4 uses one Ethernet interface as its WAN interface (G0/0) and one as its LAN interface (G0/1). Suppose that the engineer made the simple mistake of making R4’s G0/0 passive instead of G0/1. To show what happens, Example 23-7 changes R4’s G0/0 interface to be passive to OSPFv3; note that R4’s neighbor relationship to R1 fails almost immediately after the passive-interface command     is issued.\\nExample 23-7 Failure of R4’s Neighbor Relationship with R1 Due to Passivity\\nR4# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

This    next topic looks both at some samples of the process and, more important, at the number one place to look for OSPF problems: issues that prevent routers from becoming neighbors.\\nVerifying OSPFv3 Neighbors\\nNext, Example 23-8 shows some similarities     between OSPFv3 and OSPFv2 message names and neighbor states. When reading through the debug output in the example, do not worry about all the detail; instead, focus on the highlighted portions. The highlights list some familiar neighbor states from OSPFv2, like 2-way, exstart, exchange, loading, and full, which is the final desired state in this case.\\nThe example first shows the output from the debug ipv6 ospf adj command, which lists \\nmessages for OSPFv3 “adjacency” events—that is, what happens when neighbors work through their neighbor states. The end of the example shows R2’s show ipv6 ospf neighbor \\ncommand output, which confirms that R2’s neighbor state with R3 is the final full state, as mentioned in the debug message. (Note that some debug messages were deleted    for the sake of readability.)\\nExample 23-8 From R2, Watching Changes to Its Neighbor State for R3\\nR2# debug ipv6 ospf adj\\nR2#\\nJan 15 14:50:58.098: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: Added 3.3.3.3 to nbr list\\nJan 15 14:50:58.098: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: 2 Way Communication to 3.3.3.3, state \\n  2WAY\\nJan 15 14:50:58.098: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0:  DR: 3.3.3.3 (Id)   BDR: 2.2.2.2 (Id)\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  633\\nJan 15 14:50:58.098: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: Nbr 3.3.3.3: Prepare dbase exchange\\nJan 15 14:50:58.098: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: Send DBD to 3.3.3.3 seq 0x2AC5B307 opt\\n  0x0013 flag 0x7 len 28\\nJan 15 14:50:58.102: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: Rcv DBD from 3.3.3.3 seq 0xBD091ED opt\\n  0x0013 flag 0x7 len 28  mtu 1500 state EXSTART\\nJan 15 14:50:58.102: OSPFv3-2-IPv6 ADJ   Gi0/0: NBR Negotiation Done.

Most neighbors reach a full state, meaning that they fully exchanged their LSDBs directly to/from each other. However, for any OSPF network type that uses a desig-nated router (DR), only the neighbor relationships with the DR and backup DR (BDR) reach a full state. Neighbor relationships between routers that are neither DR nor BDR—DROther routers—will     stabilize to a 2-way state.\\nTroubleshooting OSPFv3 Neighbors\\nAny time it appears that OSPFv3 fails to learn routes that      it should be learning, look at the expected OSPFv3 neighbor relationships. Then, if you find a relationship that does not exist, or exists but does not reach the expected state (full or 2-way), you can focus on the various reasons why a neighbor relationship would not work.\\nNOTE As with OSPFv2, a neighbor in a full state is said to   be fully adjacent, whereas two \\nDROther neighbors that stabilize to a 2-way state are said to simply be adjacent.\\nTroubleshooting OSPF neighbor relationships requires that you remember many details about items that could prevent two routers from becoming neighbors at all. Thankfully, OSPFv3 uses the same list as OSPFv2, with one noticeable difference: OSPFv3 does not require the neighbors to be in the same subnet. Table 23-2 lists the items to consider when troubleshooting    OSPF neighbor relationships.\\nptg17396363634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 23-2 Neighbor Requirements for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\\nRequirement OSPFv2 OSPFv3\\nInterfaces must be in an up/up state.

First, Example 23-9 shows a configuration in which a router (R4) purposefully sets its RID to the same number as a neighbor (R1, RID 1.1.1.1). Reading down in the example’s highlighted portions, the following happens:\\n1. R4 changes its RID to 1.1.1.1.\\n2. R4 clears its OSPFv3 process, so that it starts using the new 1.1.1.1 RID.\\n3. R4 lists a syslog message stating the neighbor relationship went down (due to the\\nclear command).\\n4. R4 lists a syslog message stating why R4 will not now become neighbors with R1(1.1.1.1).\\nExample 23-9 Results from R4 Changing Its RID to the Same 1.1.1.1 Value as R1\\nR4# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The duplicate RID now prevents R4 and R1 from becoming neighbors, so R4’s show ipv6 \\nospf neighbor command lists no lines of output at all.\\nThe next example (Example 23-10) mimics the OSPFv2 Hello and Dead timer mismatch \\nissue shown back in Chapter 11, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols,” in the sec-tion “Finding OSPF Hello and Dead Timer Mismatches.” Again based on Figures 23-4 and 23-5, R3’s Hello and Dead timers are 10 and 40, respectively, which are the default values on Ethernet interfaces. Before gathering this output, R2’s configuration of the ipv6 ospf hello-interval 5 interface subcommand on R2’s G0/0 interface changed R2’s Hello and Dead timers to 5 and 20, respectively. (This command sets the Hello timer, and IOS then sets the Dead timer to four times      the Hello timer.)\\nExample 23-10 R3 Missing from R2’s OSPFv3 Neighbor Table\\nR2# show ipv6 ospf neighbor\\nNeighbor ID     Pri   State Dead Time   Interface ID    Interface\\n1.1.1.1 0   FULL/  - 00:00:35    6 Serial0/0/1\\nR2# show ipv6 ospf interface g0/0\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Link Local Address FE80::FF:FE00:2, Interface ID 3\\n  Area 23, Process ID 2, Instance ID 0, Router ID 2.2.2.2  Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1\\n  Transmit Delay is 1 sec, State DR, Priority 1\\n  Designated Router (ID) 2.2.2.2, local address FE80::FF:FE00:2\\n  No backup designated router on this network  Timer intervals configured, Hello 5, Dead 20, Wait 20, Retransmit 5\\nThe two commands listed in Example 23-10 confirm that R2 and R3 are no longer neigh-\\nbors over the LAN. However, just as with the similar OSPFv2 example back in Chapter 11, the router does not issue a syslog message telling us the root cause of the problem. With show commands, the only way to find this particular mismatch is to look at both routers with the show ipv6 ospf interface command; Example 23-10 shows an example from R2, listing its new      values of 5 and 20 for the Hello and Dead timers.\\nptg17396363636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFinally, note that as with OSPFv2, IOS allows the OSPFv3 routing process itself to be dis-\\nabled with the shutdown command in routing protocol configuration mode. The process and results work just like they do for OSPFv2. When shut down, the router will not have any OSPFv3 neighbors, but the configuration will not be removed. Refer to the Chapter 11 section “Shutting Down the OSPF Process” for more details. \\nOSPFv3 LSDB and LSAs\\nOnce OSPFv3 routers become neighbors, they proceed to exchange their LSDBs over that subnet. As with OSPFv2, in point-to-point topologies, the    two routers exchange their LSDBs directly, and when finished, each router lists its neighbor as having reached a full state. In broadcast topologies like Ethernet, the routers elect a DR and BDR, and exchange their databases through the DR, with all routers reaching a full state with the DR and BDR. Once in a full state, the routers should have the same LSAs for that area. In short, the pro-cess works like OSPFv2.\\nAlthough the current ICND2 and CCNA R&S exam topics    list LSAs as one of the excluded \\nitems (see the first page of the chapter), a quick look at LSAs can put some perspective on area design. For instance, Example 23-11 shows the output from the show ipv6 ospf \\ndatabase command on Router R4 from the configuration example used throughout the   middle section of this chapter. As a brief review of that example:\\n■The design shows an area 4 (as well as area 0 and area 23).\\n■Router R4 is an internal router in area 4.\\n■Router R1 is an ABR between areas 4 and 0.\\nAs a result, as seen in Example 23-11, Router R4 knows of two Type 1 LSAs. As with OSPFv2, with OSPFv3 each router creates a Type 1 router LSA for   itself and floods that LSA throughout the area. As a result, R4 should see a Type 1 LSA for itself and Router R1, but not for the other routers in the network. (Note that the example uses obvious OSPF RIDs    to make the LSAs easier to identify, with 1.1.1.1 being R1’s RID, and 4.4.4.4 being R4’s.)\\nExample 23-11 LSDB Content in Area 4, as Viewed from R4\\nR4# show ipv6 ospf database\\nOSPFv3 Router with ID (4.4.4.4) (Process ID 4)\\nRouter Link States (Area 4)\\nADV Router Age Seq# Fragment ID  Link count  Bits\\n 1.1.1.1 258 0x80000072  0 1 B\\n 4.4.4.4 257 0x80000003  0 1 None\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nThe Issue of IPv6 MTU\\nOSPFv3 can have problems    in which neighbors come up, but fail to exchange their OSPF databases, due to an IPv6 MTU mismatch. This is the same problem that OSPFv2 can have, as discussed back in the Chapter 11 section “Mismatched MTU Settings.”\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  637\\nDatabase exchange normally works correctly if two routers indeed become neighbors. That \\nis, most of the problems for both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 show up before the topology data-base exchange process happens. By way of review, two routers must first pass all the neigh-bor compatibility checks and reach 2-way state before attempting to exchange the topology databases. So, the configuration problems that prevent routers from becoming neighbors have been passed before the database exchange is attempted.\\nOne misconfiguration problem actually allows two routers to become neighbors, attempt \\nto do database exchange, and then fail after trying for a few minutes. The problem: mis-matched IPv4 or IPv6 maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes.\\nFirst, consider the idea of the MTU size, ignoring OSPF for a moment. The MTU size is a \\nsetting for a Layer 3 protocol, both IPv4 and IPv6. For now, consider only IPv6. The IPv6 MTU size of an interface defines the maximum size IPv6 packet that the router can forward out an interface. The same idea works for IPv4, with the IPv4 MTU.\\nNOTE In IPv4, routers can fragment IPv4 packets into smaller packets if a packet exceeds an interface MTU. In IPv6, hosts can detect the smallest MTU over an entire end-to-end route and avoid sending packets that exceed any MTU.\\nMost router interfaces default to an IPv4 and IPv6 MTU of 1500 bytes. You can change these values with the ip mtu size and ipv6 mtu size interface subcommands for IPv4 and \\nIPv6, respectively.\\nNow think back to OSPFv3     and the fact that two routers can become neighbors and then \\nfail to exchange their LSDBs because of unequal MTU settings. Specifically, the neighbors learn of each other with Hellos, reach a 2-way state, and reach exstart state at the beginning of the database exchange process. However, database exchange fails because    of the MTU mismatch, and the neighbor relationship fails to a down state.\\nExample 23-12 shows an example of that specific failure on R4. The example first changes \\nR4’s G0/0 IPv6 MTU to 1400, and then resets the OSPFv3 process.\\nExample 23-12 Failure to Exchange the LSDB Because of a Mismatched IPv6 MTU\\nR4# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

The two routers (R1 and R4) know of each other because the OSPF Hello messages have no problems at all. So, the show ipv6 ospf neighbor command on each router still lists the other router, as shown in R4’s output that mentions neighbor R1 (1.1.1.1). However, after a while, the neighbor relationship fails to a down state. So, when you see a neighbor in what looks like a permanent down state, check the IPv6 MTU on both sides (with the show \\nipv6 interface command).\\nOSPFv3 Metrics and IPv6 Routes\\nAt the end of all this noise about LSAs, database exchange, matching parameters for neigh-bors, and so on, the routers need to choose the best IPv6 routes to use. This final topic of the chapter reviews a few verification steps for how OSPFv3 calculates the metrics, and then looks at some more troubleshooting tips—this time about what to do with missing or suboptimal IPv6 routes.\\nVerifying OSPFv3 Interface Cost and Metrics\\nThe SPF algorithm looks for all possible        routes, or paths, from the local router to each and every subnet. When redundant paths exist between the local router and some remote sub-net, the SPF algorithm has to pick the better route, based on the lower metric of the end-to-end route, as in the example shown earlier in Figure 23-6.\\nWhen OSPFv3 adds a route to the IPv6 routing table, the metric for the route is the second \\nof the two numbers in brackets for the route. (The first number in brackets is the admin-istrative distance [AD]; the IPv6 routing protocols use the same default AD values as their IPv4 counterparts.)\\nFor example, first focus on the two metric 65 routes R1 learns for subnet \\n2001:DB8:1:23::/64, as shown in Figure 23-9. For the route through R2, R1 adds its S0/0/0 cost of 64 to R2’s G0/0 cost of 1, for a total cost of 65. R1 calculates a metric 65 route through R3, as well. With a default setting of maximum-paths 4, R1 placed both routes into the routing table. (One route uses R2 as the next hop, and one uses R3.)\\nExample 23-13 shows these two routes for subnet 2001:DB8:1:23::/64, as highlighted in the \\noutput of the show ipv6 route ospf command   on router R1. As usual, the OSPF-learned routes list a next-hop link-local address. To see which route refers to R2, and which refers to R3, check the outgoing interfaces and compare them to Figure 23-9.\\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  639\\nR3 R1R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0 2001:DB8:1: 23::/64G0/0Cost 1\\nCost 64Cost 64\\nCost 1S0/0/1G0/0\\nFigure 23-9 Two Equal-Metric Routes from R1 to 2001:DB8:1:23::/64\\nExample 23-13 OSPFv3 Routes on R1\\nR1# show ipv6 route ospf\\n!

This cost is based on R2’s default S0/0/1 cost of 64, plusR1’s G0/0.11 cost of 1.\\n■R2 decided the route through R3 was worse because the cost was the sum of R2’s G0/0\\ncost (1), R3’s S0/0/0 cost (64), and R1’s G0/0.11 cost (1), for a total of 66.\\nFigure 23-10 shows the interface costs for these two competing routes. Note that the draw-\\ning omits parts of the network as shown earlier in Figure 23-4.\\nR3 R1R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/02001:DB8:1: 1::/64G0/0\\nCost 1\\nCost 64Cost 64\\nCost 1\\nFigure 23-10 R2’s Competing Routes to Reach Subnet 1\\nptg17396363640  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 23-14 OSPFv3 Routes on R2\\nR2# show ipv6 route ospf\\n!

The O \\nidentifies the route as being learned by OSPF, and the I identifies the route as an   interarea \\nroute. For instance, the highlighted entry lists prefix/subnet 1 (2001:DB8:1:1::/64), which sits in area 0, and R2 is in area 23. So, R2’s route to this subnet is an interarea route. (Earlier, Example 23-13 showed several intra-area OSPF routes, each with code letter O instead of \\nOI.)\\nOSPFv3 displays the settings for OSPFv3 interface cost with commands similar to those \\nused in OSPFv2. For the default calculations, the show ipv6 ospf command lists the refer-ence bandwidth, and the show interfaces command lists the interface bandwidth. Example 23-15              shows the current OSPFv3 interface costs on R1 with the show ipv6 ospf interface \\nbrief command.\\nExample 23-15 Finding a Router’s OSPFv3 Interface Costs\\nR1# show ipv6 ospf interface brief\\nInterface    PID   Area            Intf ID    Cost  State Nbrs F/C\\nGi0/0.12     1     0 16 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/0.11     1     0 17 1     DR    0/0\\nGi0/1 1     4 4 1     BDR   1/1\\nSe0/0/0 1     23 6 64    P2P   1/1\\nSe0/0/1 1     23 7 64    P2P   1/1\\nTroubleshooting IPv6 Routes Added by OSPFv3\\nIf a problem appears to be related      to IPv6 routing, the problems can be put into two broad \\ncategories. First, a router may be missing a route for some prefix, so the router discards the packet, and pings fail. Second, a router may have a working route, but it appears to take a suboptimal route to the destination. (Chapter 22, “IPv6 Routing Operation and Troubleshooting,” in the “Traceroute Shows Some Hops, But Fails” section, discusses yet a third category in which a routing loop occurs.)\\nFor example, in Figure 23-11, Router R1 has two possible routes to reach subnet 33, an \\nIPv6 subnet off Router R3. The top route appears to be the better route, at least in terms of the number of routers between R1 and subnet 33. If R1 has no routes at all to subnet 33, \\nptg1739636323Chapter 23: Implementing OSPF for IPv6  641\\nyou might look for one type of root cause; but if R1 uses the lower route through five rout-\\ners, you might look for a different root cause.\\nR3 R2 R1\\nR7 R6 R5 R4Optimal Route?\\nSuboptimal Route?***\\n***Subnet 33\\n*\\nFigure 23-11 Competing Long and Short Routes from R1 to Subnet 33\\nWhen a router simply has no route to a given subnet—for instance, if R1 has no route at all for subnet 33—do the following:\\nStep 1. Check the routers with interfaces directly connected to that IPv6 prefix. A \\nrouter must have OSPFv3 enabled on that interface before OSPFv3 will adver-\\ntise about the subnet.\\nStep 2. Check OSPFv3 neighbor relationships for all routers between the local router \\nand the routers with an interface connected to IPv6 prefix X.\\nFor instance, in Figure 23-11, if Router R3 did not have an ipv6 ospf process-id area \\narea-id command on its LAN interface, all seven routers could have working neighbor \\nrelationships, but R3 still would not advertise about subnet 33.\\nIf a router has a route, but it appears to be the wrong      (suboptimal) route, take these steps:\\nStep 1. Check for broken neighbor relationships over what should be the optimal path \\nfrom the local router and prefix Y.\\nStep 2. Check the OSPFv3 cost settings on the interfaces in the optimal path.\\nFor instance, in Figure 23-11, suppose that R1 indeed has one route for subnet 33, pointing \\nover the lower route, with R4 as the next-hop router. The root cause of that choice could be the following:\\n■The R2-R3 neighbor relationship is not working.\\n■The sum of the costs for the top route is larger (worse) than the sum of the costs for the\\nlower route. (Note that the figure shows an asterisk beside      each interface whose cost is\\npart of the calculation.)\\nptg17396363642  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

With EIGRP, the only noticeable difference is the configuration, which enables EIGRP for IPv6 directly on the interfaces and, of course, the use of IPv6 addresses and prefixes.

Once enabled on \\nall routers in an internetwork, the routers exchange EIGRP messages. Those messages allow the routers to discover neighbors, form neighbor relationships, advertise subnets along with their metric components, and calculate metrics for competing routes using the same old cal-culation. EIGRP for IPv6 also uses the same successor and feasible successor (FS) logic, and              Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) processing when no FS exists.\\nDifferences do exist, of course, with the most obvious being that EIGRP for IPv6 advertises \\nIPv6 prefixes, not IPv4 subnets. The messages flow    in IPv6 packets, many going to IPv6 multicast address FF02::A. But most of the big ideas mirror EIGRP for IPv4.\\nAs for configuration, EIGRP for IPv6 configuration looks much like the OSPFv3 configura-\\ntion just discussed in Chapter 23. The EIGRP for IPv6 routing protocol process must be cre-ated, and then must be enabled on various interfaces using an interface subcommand. The rest of the EIGRP for IPv6 configuration is optional, to change some default setting, with changes to what happens between neighbors, what metric is calculated, and so on.\\nNOTE This chapter shows one of two styles of EIGRP for IPv6 configuration called clas-sic mode (also called autonomous system mode). EIGRP classic mode has existed since EIGRP for IPv6 first became available. The more involved EIGRP named mode, which uses address families, can be used as well but is not included in this book.\\nThis first section first works through the most common EIGRP for IPv6 configuration com-mands, followed by a look at the various other commands used to change some small fea-ture.\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  647\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Configuration Basics\\nEIGRP for IPv6 configuration works    much like OSPFv3. That is, the commands create the \\nEIGRP for IPv6 process in one part of the configuration, with interface subcommands enabling the routing protocol on the interface. Figure 24-1 shows the fundamentals of this core configuration for IPv6.\\nDefine AS Number\\ninterface S0/0/0\\nDirect!ipv6 router eigrp 1 Configuration\\neigrp router-id 1.1.1.1\\nipv6 eigrp 1 Set Router ID (Optional)\\n(Directly) Enable EIGRP Process,\\nby ASN, on the InterfaceEIGRP Mode:\\nInterface Mode:\\nFigure 24-1 Fundamentals of EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration\\nIf you remember EIGRP for IPv4 configuration, you will quickly see one key difference \\nbetween the configuration in Figure 24-1 and what you know about EIGRP for IPv4. The example in the figure does not use any EIGRP network commands   at all because EIGRP for IPv6 does not even support the network command. Instead, it uses the ipv6 eigrp asn inter-\\nface subcommand. This process works like the OSPFv3 configuration from the preceding chapter, just with a slightly different command for EIGRP for IPv6.\\nThe rest of the EIGRP for IPv6 configuration commands    work either exactly like the EIGRP \\nfor IPv4 commands or very similarly to them. To show the similarities, Table 24-2 lists the EIGRP for IPv4 configuration options introduced in Chapter 10, “Implementing EIGRP for IPv4,” making comparisons to the similar configuration options in EIGRP for IPv6.\\nTable 24-2 Comparison of EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration Commands\\nFunction EIGRP for IPv4 EIGRP for IPv6\\nCreate process, define ASN router eigrp as-number  ipv6 router eigrp as-number  \\nDefine router ID explicitly (router \\nmode)eigrp router-id number  Identical\\nChange number of concurrent routes (router mode)maximum-paths number  Identical\\nSet the variance multiplier (router mode)variance multiplier  Identical\\nInfluence metric calculation (interface mode)bandwidth value  \\ndelay value  Identical\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 C 2 A 3 D 4 D 5 B, E 6 A\\nptg17396363648  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFunction EIGRP for IPv4 EIGRP for IPv6\\nChange Hello and hold timers \\n(interface mode)ip hello-interval eigrp asn time ip hold-t ime \\neigrp asn time  Change ip to ipv6\\nEnable EIGRP on an interface network ip-address \\n[wildcard-mask]  ipv6 eigrp as-number (interface subcommand)  \\nDisable and enable automatic summarization (router mode)[no] auto-summary  Not needed for EIGRP for IPv6\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Configuration Example\\nTo show EIGRP for IPv6 configuration in context, the next    several pages show an example \\nusing the internetwork from Figure 24-2. The figure shows the IPv6 subnets. It also shows the last quartet of each router’s interface IPv6 address as ::X, where X is the router number, to make it more obvious as to which router uses which address.\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1S0/1/0S0/1/0G0/02001:DB8:1:3::\\nG0/0S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1S0/0/0S0/0/1\\n2001:DB8:1:4::2001:DB8:1:8::2001:DB8:1:6::\\nG0/0R2R3G0/0\\nR1S0/1/0S0/0/1R42001:DB8:1:33::\\n2001:DB8:1:7::\\n2001:DB8:1:2::2001:DB8:1:5::\\n2001:DB8:1:1::::3::3\\n::3 ::3\\n::1\\n::1\\n::1 ::2::2 ::2\\n::2::4::4::4\\nFigure 24-2 Internetwork for an Example Multiarea EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration\\nNote that Figure 24-2 mimics Figure 10-3, a figure used in several EIGRP for IPv4 examples \\nin Chapter 10. Figure 24-2 uses the exact same interface types and numbers and router names. In fact, it uses a similar subnet numbering pattern. For instance, think of the four LAN-based IPv6 subnets as subnets 1, 2, 3, and 33, based on the last quartet values. Those same subnets in the examples in Chapter 10, based on the third octet of the IPv4 subnet numbers, are also 1, 2, 3, and 33, respectively.\\nWhy does it matter that the internetwork used for this chapter mirrors the one used in \\nChapter 10? Not only are the EIGRP configuration commands similar but also the show \\ncommand output. The show commands in this chapter, by using the exact same network topology, list almost the exact same output for EIGRP for IPv6 as they did for EIGRP for IPv4.\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  649\\nFor this specific example, Example 24-1 begins by listing the additional IPv6 configuration \\nrequired on R1 to make it a dual-stack router, including EIGRP for IPv6 configuration. The highlighted lines are the EIGRP for IPv6–specific configuration commands, while the rest    of the configuration adds IPv6 routing and addressing.\\nExample 24-1 IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration on Router R1\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\nipv6 router eigrp 1\\n eigrp router-id 1.1.1.1\\n!interface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:1::1/64\\n ipv6 eigrp 1\\n!interface serial 0/0/0\\n description link to R2\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:5::1/64\\n ipv6 eigrp 1!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n description link to R3\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:4::1/64\\n ipv6 eigrp 1\\nWith this first example, take a few moments to review the configuration thoroughly. All the \\nrouters need to use the same EIGRP for IPv6 autonomous system number (ASN), as config-ured     on the ipv6 router eigrp asn global command. Just after this command, R1 explicitly \\nsets its EIGRP router ID (RID) using the eigrp router-id command. Note that EIGRP for IPv6 also uses a 32-bit RID, as does OSPFv3, with the same exact rules for how a router picks the value.\\nThe rest of the configuration simply enables EIGRP for IPv6 on each interface by referring \\nto the correct EIGRP for IPv6 process, by ASN, using the ipv6 eigrp asn interface subcom-\\nmand.\\nExample 24-2 shows the configuration on a second router (R2). Note that it also uses ASN \\n1 because it must match the ASN used by Router R1. Otherwise, these two routers    will not become neighbors. Also, note that R2 sets its RID to 2.2.2.2.\\nExample 24-2 EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration on R2\\nipv6 unicast-routing\\n!\\nipv6 router eigrp 1\\n eigrp router-id 2.2.2.2\\n!interface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:2::2/64\\nptg17396363650  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n ipv6 eigrp 1\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/0\\n description link to R3\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:6::2/64 ipv6 eigrp 1\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n description link to R1 ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:5::2/64\\n ipv6 eigrp 1\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/1/0 description link to R4\\n ipv6 address 2001:db8:1:8::2/64\\n ipv6 eigrp 1\\nNOTE IOS allows the EIGRP for IPv6 routing process to be disabled, and then reenabled, \\nusing the shutdown and no shutdown commands in EIGRP configuration mode. While enabled by default at later IOS versions, note that earlier          IOS versions defaulted to a dis-abled state, requiring the configuration of a no shutdown command in EIGRP configuration mode before EIGRP for IPv6 would work.\\nOther EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration Settings\\nExamples 24-1 and 24-2 showed the basics for EIGRP for IPv6 configuration. The next few pages discuss a few configuration options in comparison to EIGRP for IPv4.\\nSetting Bandwidth and Delay to Influence EIGRP for IPv6 Route Selection\\nBy default, EIGRP for IPv6 uses the exact         same settings as EIGRP for IPv4 when calculating the metrics for each route. And to be extra clear, the settings are not similar or simply using the same command syntax. EIGRP for IPv6 uses the exact same settings as EIGRP for IPv4, specifically the interface bandwidth and delay settings, as configured with the bandwidth \\nand delay interface subcommands. A change to these values impacts both EIGRP for IPv4’s \\ncalculation of metrics and EIGRP for IPv6’s calculation.\\nEIGRP for IPv6 also uses the exact same formula as EIGRP for IPv4 to calculate the metric \\nfor a route. As a result, in some conditions, the EIGRP for IPv4 metric for a route to an IPv4 subnet will be the same metric as the EIGRP for IPv6 route from the same router to IPv6 subnet in the same location.\\nFor instance, in Figure 24-3, all the routers are dual-stack routers, with EIGRP for IPv4 and \\nEIGRP for IPv6 enabled on all the interfaces in the design. Subnet 10.1.33.0/24 has been noted in the upper right, in the same location as IPv6 subnet 33 (2001:DB8:1:33::/64). R1’s EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 processes will calculate the same exact metric for these routes based on the same collection of interface bandwidth and delay settings.\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  651\\nS0/0/0S0/0/1S0/1/0S0/1/0G0/0\\nG0/0S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1S0/0/0S0/0/1\\nG0/0R2R3G0/0\\nR1S0/1/0S0/0/1R42001:DB8:1:33::/6410.1.33.0/24\\nFigure 24-3 Same Location off R4 for IPv4 Subnet 33 and IPv6 Subnet 33\\nExample 24-3 shows the IPv4 and IPv6 routes on R1 for the subnets shown in Figure 24-3. \\nNote the highlighted metrics in all cases are 2,684,416.\\nExample 24-3 Identical Metrics for IPv4 and IPv6 Routes with EIGRP for IPv4 and \\nEIGRP for IPv6\\nR1# show ip route | section 10.1.3 3.0\\nD 10.1.33.0/24 [90/2684416] via 10.1.5.2, 00:02:23, Serial0/0/0\\n[90/2684416] via 10.1.4.3, 00:02:23, Serial0/0/1\\nR1# show ipv6 route | section 2001:DB8:1:33::/64\\nD   2001:DB8:1:33::/64 [90/2684416]\\n     via FE80::FF:FE00:3, Serial0/0/1\\n     via FE80::FF:FE00:2, Serial0/0/0\\nNote that both commands list two equal-cost routes on R1, for subnet 33, but the format \\nof the output differs a little. The format of the show ip route command puts the destina-tion subnet on the same first line as the first route’s forwarding instructions. The show ipv6 route command lists the destination prefix on the first line, with each route’s forwarding instructions         on the second and third lines, respectively.\\nEIGRP Load Balancing\\nEIGRP for IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv4 use the     exact same concepts, with the exact same configuration command syntax, for equal-cost and unequal-cost load balancing. However, EIGRP for IPv6 has its own configuration settings, made with the maximum-paths and variance commands inside EIGRP for IPv6 configuration mode. EIGRP for IPv4 has separate settings, using these same two commands, in EIGRP for IPv4 configuration mode.\\nFor example, imagine that in a dual-stack network, the routers use EIGRP for IPv4 and \\nEIGRP for IPv6. The network engineer would probably choose     the same variance and \\nptg17396363652  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nmaximum-paths settings for both routing protocols. However, for the sake of pointing out \\nthe differences, imagine the engineer chose different settings, like these:\\n■EIGRP for IPv4: At most 2 routes, with variance 3 for unequal cost routes\\n■EIGRP for IPv6: At most 5 routes, with variance 4 for unequal cost routes\\nExample 24-4 shows how to make these different settings for these two different routing processes. However, note that the commands happen     to use the exact same syntax.\\nExample 24-4 Setting Load-Balancing Parameters per Routing Process\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\n! First, configure the settings for IPv4\\nR1(config)# router eigrp 10\\nR1(config-router)# maximum-paths 2R1(config-router)# variance 3\\n! Next, configure the similar settings for IPv6\\nR1(config-router)# ipv6 router eigrp 11\\nR1(config-rtr)# maximum-paths 5R1(config-rtr)# variance 4\\nR1(config-rtr)# ^Z\\nR1#\\nEIGRP Timers\\nEIGRP for IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv4 use     the exact same concepts for the Hello and hold \\ntimers as does EIGRP for IPv4. To allow these values to be set differently for each routing process, IOS gives us slightly different syntax on the EIGRP for IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv4 commands, with the EIGRP for IPv6 commands using the keyword ipv6 rather than ip. Otherwise, the EIGRP for IPv6 syntax mirrors the EIGRP for IPv4 version of the commands.\\nExample 24-5 shows a sample that changes both the EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 \\nHello timer, just to show the different commands side by side. For EIGRP for IPv4, the Hello timer is set to 6 seconds, and for EIGRP for IPv6, it is set to 7 seconds.\\nExample 24-5 Setting the EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 Hello Timers\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nR1(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/1\\nR1(config-if)# ip hello-interval eigrp 10 6\\nR1(config-if)# ipv6 hello-interval eigrp 11 7R1(config-rtr)# ^Z\\nR1#\\nThe choices for the timer values are arbitrary, just to make it clear which command is for \\neach routing protocol. In real networks, these settings will likely have the same values     for both EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6.\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  653\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Verification and Troubleshooting\\nTo the depth discussed in this book, EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 behave almost \\nidentically. Earlier, Table 24-2 listed the configuration commands, side by side, to show the similarities. This second major section of the chapter now looks at EIGRP for IPv6 verifica-tion and troubleshooting, with even more similarities between EIGRP for IPv6 and its older cousin EIGRP for IPv4.\\nSo many similarities exist between EIGRP for IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv4 that you should just \\nassume that they work the same, except for a     few differences, as noted in the following list:\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 advertises IPv6 prefixes, whereas EIGRP for IPv4 advertises IPv4\\nsubnets.\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 show commands use a keyword of ipv6, in the same position where\\nEIGRP show commands use a keyword of ip.\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 uses the same checklist for choosing whether to become neighbors,\\nexcept EIGRP for IPv6 routers may become neighbors if they have IPv6 addresses in dif-\\nferent subnets. (EIGRP for IPv4 neighbors must be in the same IPv4 subnet.)\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 does not have an autosummary concept (while EIGRP for IPv4 does).\\nAs you can see, the list of differences mentioned here is short. The similarities will become \\nclearer through the many examples of show command output in the remainder of this chapter. To begin, Figure 24-4 reviews the EIGRP for IPv6 show commands discussed in \\nthis chapter. Note that all the commands in the figure use the same syntax as the EIGRP for IPv4 equivalent but with ip changed to ipv6.\\nshow running-config\\nshow ipv6 eigrp interfaces\\nshow ipv6 eigrp interfaces detailshow ipv6 eigrp interfaces type number\\nshow ipv6 protocols\\nshow ipv6 eigrp neighbors\\nshow ipv6 eigrp neighbors type number\\nshow ipv6 protocols\\nshow ipv6 eigrp topology\\nshow ipv6 eigrp topology subnet/prefix\\nshow ipv6 eigrp topology | section subnet\\nshow ipv6 routeshow ipv6 route eigrpshow ipv6 route subnet/prefix\\nshow ipv6 route | section subnet/prefixipv6 eigrp asn \\nCommands\\nDiscover \\nwith Hello\\nUpdate\\nCalculateConfig\\nEnabled\\nInterfaces\\nRoutesTopologyNeighbors\\nFigure 24-4 Reference of EIGRP for IPv6 Verification Commands\\nSimilar to the preceding chapter’s flow, this chapter’s second major section breaks the dis-\\ncussion down in the same general sequence as EIGRP for IPv6 does when bringing up the EIGRP for IPv6 process. This section first examines EIGRP for IPv6 interfaces, then neigh-bors, topology, and finally, IPv6 routes.\\nptg17396363654  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE All the troubleshooting examples in the rest of this chapter use the example con-\\nfiguration from Routers R1, R2, R3, and R4, as shown in Figure 24-2.\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Interfaces\\nBy enabling EIGRP for IPv6 on an interface, the    router attempts to do two things:\\n1. Discover EIGRP for IPv6 neighbors off that interface\\n2. Advertise about the prefix connected to that interface\\nTo make sure that EIGRP for IPv6 works correctly, an engineer should verify that EIGRP for IPv6 is enabled on the right interfaces. Or, from a troubleshooting perspective, one of the most common problems with EIGRP for IPv6 may be that a router did not enable EIGRP for IPv6 on an interface.\\nAs was the case for EIGRP for IPv4, with EIGRP for IPv6, some commands list all inter-\\nfaces on which EIGRP is enabled (including passive), some list all EIGRP interfaces but note which are passive, and some simply do not list the passive interfaces. Example 24-6 shows a sample that points out these differences, by first making R1’s G0/0 interface passive. It then lists output from the show ipv6 eigrp interfaces command, which omits G0/0, and then the show ipv6 protocols command, which includes G0/0, but noted         as a passive interface.\\nExample 24-6 Verifying OSPFv3 Interfaces and Related Parameters\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

As with \\nOSPF, most troubleshooting revolves around     the neighbor relationships. However, this short list describes two problems that can happen related to the interfaces:\\n■The omission of an ipv6 eigrp asn interface subcommand on an interface that has no\\npossible neighbors may go overlooked. This omission does not impact EIGRP for IPv6\\nneighbors. However, this omission means that EIGRP for IPv6 is not enabled on thatinterface, and therefore the router will not advertise about that connected subnet. Thisproblem shows up as a missing route.\\n■Making an interface passive to the EIGRP for IPv6 process, when a potential EIGRP for\\nIPv6 neighbor is connected to that link, prevents the two routers from becoming neigh-bors. Note that the neighbor relationship fails with just one of the two routers having apassive interface.\\nFor example, consider Router R4 in this chapter’s sample network. Its G0/0 interface con-\\nnects to a LAN, with no other routers. Currently, R4’s configuration includes the ipv6 eigrp \\n1 interface subcommand on R4’s G0/0 interface. If instead that command were mistakenly missing (or if it were just removed as an experiment in lab), R4 would not advertise a route for the connected subnet (subnet 33, or 2001:DB8:1:33::/64).\\nExample 24-7 shows that specific example. To re-create the problem, though, before gath-\\nering the output in Example 24-7 on R4, the no ipv6 eigrp 1 command was issued on R4’s G0/0 interface, disabling EIGRP from that interface. Example 24-7     then shows R1 does not have a route to subnet 33 or EIGRP topology data.\\nExample 24-7 Missing Route to Subnet 33 on R1\\nR1# show ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1:33::\\n% Route not found\\nR1# show ipv6 eigrp topology | include 2001:DB8:1:33\\nR1#\\nptg17396363656  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Neighbors\\nFrom one perspective, EIGRP neighbor relationships     are simple. When two EIGRP for IPv6 \\nrouters sit on the same data link, they discover each other with EIGRP for IPv6 Hello mes-sages. Those Hello messages list some parameters, and the neighbors check the Hello to determine whether the routers should become neighbors:\\n■If the parameters match, each router adds the other router to their EIGRP for IPv6 neigh-\\nbor table, as listed with the show ipv6 eigrp neighbors command.\\n■If the parameters do not match, the routers do not become neighbors, do not add each\\nother to their neighbor tables, and do not list each other in the output of the show ipv6\\neigrp neighbors command.\\nFrom another perspective, troubleshooting EIGRP neighbor relationships means that you have to remember a lot of small details. The neighbors check lists of parameters that must match. At the same time, other problems can prevent the routers from becoming neighbors as well. Thankfully, EIGRP for IPv6 uses the same list as EIGRP for IPv4, with one notice-able difference: EIGRP for IPv6 does not require the neighbors to be in the same subnet.\\nTable 24-3 lists the items to consider when troubleshooting    EIGRP neighbor relationships.\\nTable 24-3 Neighbor Requirements for EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6\\nRequirement EIGRP for \\nIPv4EIGRP for IPv6\\nInterfaces must be in an up/up state. Y es Y es\\nInterfaces must be in the same subnet. Y es No\\nAccess control lists (ACL) must not filter routing protocol messages. Y es Y es\\nMust pass routing protocol neighbor authentication (if configured). Y es Y es\\nMust use the same ASN on the router configuration command. Ye s Ye s\\nK values must match. Y es\\n1Ye s1\\nHello and hold timers must match. No No\\nRouter IDs must be unique. No2No2\\n1 K values define the EIGRP metric calculation algorithm. Cisco recommends that the settings be left as is; \\nthe metric weights command in router mode reconfigures the settings.\\n2 Having duplicate EIGRP RIDs does not prevent routers from becoming neighbors, but it can cause prob-\\nlems when external EIGRP routes are added to the routing table.\\nFor instance, in the configuration example in this chapter, all four routers use EIGRP for \\nIPv6 ASN 1. However, suppose that Router R2’s configuration had mistakenly used ASN 2, while the other three routers correctly used ASN 1. What would happen? R2 would        have failed to form a neighbor relationship with any of the other routers.\\nMany EIGRP for IPv6 show commands mention the EIGRP for IPv6 ASN, but the show \\nipv6 protocols command shows the value in a couple of obvious places. Example 24-6, ear-lier, shows this.\\nAs a troubleshooting strategy for the exam, note that every pair of EIGRP for IPv6 routers \\non the same link should become neighbors. So, when an exam question appears to point \\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  657\\nto some IPv6 routing problem, check the routers, count the EIGRP neighbor relationships, \\nand make sure all the neighbor relationships exist. If any are missing, start troubleshooting EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor relationships based on Table 24-3.\\nTo examine the neighbors, use the show ipv6 eigrp neighbors command. Because of the \\nlength of IPv6 addresses, this command lists two lines per neighbor rather than one line (as is the case with the EIGRP for IPv4 version of this command). The output in Example 24-8 shows this command’s output from Router R2, with highlights in two lines for a single neighbor (R3).\\nExample 24-8 R2’s EIGRP for IPv6 Neighbors\\nR2# show ipv6 eigrp neighbors\\nEIGRP-IPv6 Neighbors for AS(1)\\nH   Address                 Interface Hold Uptime   SRTT   RTO  Q  Seq\\n(sec) (ms) Cnt Num\\n2   Link-local address:     Se0/1/0 10 06:37:34  104   624  0  13\\n    FE80::D68C:B5FF:FE6B:DB48\\n1   Link-local address:     Se0/0/0 11 06:37:54    1   100  0  38\\n    FE80::FF:FE00:3\\n0   Link-local address:     Se0/0/1 11 06:46:11    1   100  0  30\\n    FE80::FF:FE00:1\\nTake a moment to focus on the IPv6 address and interface listed in the highlighted two \\nlines. The output, taken from Router R2, lists R3’s link-local address that sits on the other end of R2’s S0/0/0 interface. The listed S0/0/0 interface is R2’s interface. In summary, the details list the local router’s interface and the neighbor’s link-local address. So, to identify the EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor, you have to use that neighbor’s link-local address        (and not their EIGRP for IPv6 RID).\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Topology Database\\nIf you keep the discussions to topics within     the scope of this book, once EIGRP for IPv6 routers become neighbors, they should exchange all appropriate topology data. Outside the scope of this book, other router features can filter the topology data sent between routers. But for now, if the neighbor comes up, you can assume they exchange the topology data.\\nHowever, you should be ready to interpret the meaning of some of the topology data \\ndescribed by EIGRP for IPv6. Thankfully, the EIGRP for IPv6 topology data works just like it does for EIGRP for IPv4, other than one obvious difference: It lists IPv6 prefixes. The fol-lowing list points out the concepts that remain identical between the two:\\n■The metric components (bandwidth, delay, reliability, load)\\n■The metric calculation\\n■The idea of a successor route (the best route)\\n■The idea of FS routes\\n■The feasibility condition, in which the reported distance (the composite metric reported\\nby the neighbor) is lower (better) than the local router’s metric\\nptg17396363658  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFor example, Figure 24-5 shows an excerpt from the output of the show ipv6 eigrp \\ntopology command. This output shows R1’s topology data for subnet 3 \\n(2001:DB8:1:3::/64), the subnet off R3’s G0/0 LAN interface. The left side shows the two details particular to IPv6: the IPv6 prefix/length and the next-hop router’s link-local address.\\nNumber of Successors\\nFeasible Distance (FD)\\nOutgoing Interface Metric \\nReported Distance (RD) Next-Hop Router\\n(Link Local)Prefix/Length\\nP 2001:DB8:1:3::/64 1 successors, FD is 2172416\\n(2172416/28160), Serial0/0/1 via FE80::FF:FE00:3\\nFigure 24-5 Comparing IPv6 Details Versus Common Parts of EIGRP Topology Data\\nNote that while the left side shows the IPv6 prefix and IPv6 next-hop router address, the right side shows the exact same ideas as used with EIGRP for IPv4. In fact, this example mir-rors an example back in Chapter 10, shown there as Figure 10-4. That chapter also showed topology data from R1’s database for the subnet off R3’s G0/0 LAN interface. However, that example was for EIGRP for IPv4 and for subnet 10.1.3.0/24. If you take the time to flip back to Figure 10-4, you will see the exact same information for all the data on the right based on the EIGRP for IPv4 topology database, but IPv4 information about the subnet, mask, and next-hop address on the left.\\nIn short, study the Chapter 10 details about the metric components, the metric computed as \\na formula, the successor and FS, and so on. If you master those details for EIGRP for IPv4, you have mastered the equivalent for EIGRP for IPv6.\\nExample 24-9 shows the EIGRP topology table for one last insight into the inter-\\nnals of EIGRP for IPv6. The output shows R1’s detailed topology data for subnet 3 (2001:DB8:1:3::/64). Note that the first highlighted line lists the next-hop address and outgoing interface. It lists the composite metric—that is, the metric as calculated from the input of the various metric components—on the second highlighted line. The next two highlighted lines show the two metric components that impact the calculation (by default): bandwidth and delay. Finally, note     that it mentions that EIGRP uses the minimum band-width (1544 Kbps) and the total delay (20,100).\\nExample 24-9 R2’s EIGRP for IPv6 Neighbors\\nR1# show ipv6 eigrp topology 2001:DB8:1:3::/64\\nEIGRP-IPv6 Topology Entry for AS(1)/ID(1.1.1.1) for 2001:DB8:1:3::/64\\n  State is Passive, Query origin flag is 1, 1 Successor(s), FD is 2172416\\n  Descriptor Blocks:\\n  FE80::FF:FE00:3 (Serial0/0/1), from FE80::FF:FE00:3, Send flag is 0x0\\nComposite metric is (2172416/28160), route is InternalVector metric:\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  659\\nMinimum bandwidth is 1544 Kbit\\nTotal delay is 20100 microseconds\\nReliability is 255/255\\nLoad is 1/255\\nMinimum MTU is 1500\\nHop count is 1\\nOriginating router is 3.3.3.3\\n  FE80::FF:FE00:2 (Serial0/0/0), from FE80::FF:FE00:2, Send flag is 0x0\\nComposite metric is (2684416/2172416), route is Internal\\nVector metric:\\nMinimum bandwidth is 1544 Kbit\\nTotal delay is 40100 microseconds\\nReliability is 255/255Load is 1/255\\nMinimum MTU is 1500\\nHop count is 2\\nEIGRP for IPv6 Routes\\nVerifying EIGRP for IPv6–learned routes     is relatively easy as long as you realize that the \\ncode for EIGRP is D and not E.

Each route lists at least two lines, with the first line list-ing the prefix/length and, in brackets, the administrative distance and the metric (feasible distance). The second line lists the forwarding instructions for a route.\\nWhen a router has multiple routes to reach one IPv6 prefix, the output shows one line with \\nthe prefix and then one line for each route. The line for each route lists the forwarding instructions (neighbor’s link-local address and local router’s outgoing interface). The high-lighted lines at the end of the example, for subnet 33, show one such example, with     two routes, each with a different next-hop address and different outgoing interface.\\nAs for troubleshooting IPv6 routes, again, most of the troubleshooting for routes begins \\nwith questions about neighbors. Thinking through a potential EIGRP     for IPv6 problem actu-ally follows the same logic as working through an OSPFv3 problem. Repeating some of the logic from the preceding chapter, when a router simply has no route to a given subnet—for instance, if R1 had no route at all for subnet 33—then do the following:\\nStep 1. Check the routers with interfaces directly connected to that IPv6 prefix. A \\nrouter must have EIGRP for IPv6 enabled on that interface before EIGRP for \\nIPv6 will advertise about the subnet.\\nStep 2. Check EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor relationships for all routers between the local \\nrouter and the routers with an interface connected to IPv6 prefix X.\\nFor instance, in Figure 24-2, if Router R4 did not have an ipv6 eigrp 1 command under its \\nG0/0 interface, all the routers would have their correct EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor relation-\\nships, but R4 would not advertise about subnet 33.\\nIf a router has a route but it appears to be the wrong (suboptimal) route, take these steps:\\nStep 1. Check for broken neighbor relationships over what should be the optimal path \\nfrom the local router and prefix Y.\\nStep 2. Check the interface bandwidth and delay settings. Pay particular attention to \\nthe lowest bandwidth in the end-to-end route, because EIGRP ignores the faster \\nbandwidths, using only the lowest (slowest) bandwidth in its     metric calculation.\\nptg1739636324Chapter 24: Implementing EIGRP for IPv6  661\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

IPv6 ACLs provide a way to secure inbound and outbound connections as a part to the overall corpo-rate security strategy and policy. Thus, IPv6 ACLs are a component of a layered security model that provides diversity of defensive techniques and defense in depth of complemen-tary security approaches. \\nIPv6 ACLs share many of the same characteristics as IPv4 ACL, so your knowledge of IPv4 \\nACLs is directly transferable to IPv6 ACLs. As you have already learned, IPv6 is similar to IPv4, but it has some subtle differences in the way it works. Your knowledge of IPv4 is essential to learning IPv6, and at this point, your knowledge of IPv6 is solidifying. The same is true for the subtle differences between IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs. Both IP version ACLs can filter on IP addresses of packets and upper-layer information. IPv6 ACLs provide the ability to filter on IPv6-specific header values and other IPv6 packet attributes.\\nIPv6 ACLs can be used for a variety of reasons and purposes. IPv6 ACLs can filter traffic \\ntraversing the network, but IPv6 ACLs can also filter management access traffic. IPv6 ACLs can also be used to create Quality of Service (QoS) policies and to filter routing advertise-ments. However, the focus of this chapter will be on the ways in which IPv6 ACLs can be used to filter IPv6 packets arriving and departing router interfaces.\\nThis chapter builds upon the IPv6 information in the ICND1 book and the IPv6 chapters \\nearlier in this book. This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of IPv6 ACLs. The focus is on standard and extended IPv6 ACLs.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

All IPv6 multicast packets on a LAN interface\\nFoundation Topics\\nIPv6 Access Control List Basics\\nIPv6 ACLs provide the network engineer with a method to filter IPv6 packets. IPv6 packets \\ncan match the configuration of the ACL and then be permitted or denied from entering or exiting the router’s interface. IPv6 ACLs can match on the various fields of the IPv6 header, including the source and destination addresses. IPv6 ACLs   can also match on the other upper-layer header parameters and extension headers and Internet Control Message Protocol Version 6 (ICMPv6) packets.\\nThere are several types of and uses for ACLs. ACLs can be used to filter control-plane \\nactivity, either to filter routing updates or to secure the router’s own internal control plane. ACLs are used when matching and classifying types of data traffic when configuring QoS. ACLs can also be used to filter management plane packets to help secure configuration activities by allowing only management protocol access from approved network administra-tor systems.\\nThe traditional use of ACLs, and the focus of this chapter, involves their ability to permit \\nor deny packets traversing the router’s data-plane interfaces. ACLs can filter many different types of packets, but this chapter narrows the focus to how ACLs can be used to filter IPv6 packets that are traversing the network. IPv6 ACLs can permit or deny specific types of IPv6 packets that are flowing from a source node to a destination node.\\nThis first section of this chapter covers IPv6 ACLs and how they are used for filtering IPv6 \\npackets in the data plan on router interfaces.\\nSimilarities and Differences Between IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs\\nAt this point you should be familiar with IPv4 ACLs but just starting to learn about IPv6 ACLs. As you learn about IPv6, you will notice subtle differences about IPv6 that have direct functional relationships with IPv4 protocol operations. Similarly, there are subtle sim-ilarities and differences between the way that IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs operate. Following are the ways that IPv4 and IPv6 are     similar:\\n■Both match on the source address or the destination address in the protocol header.\\n■Both match individual host addresses or subnets/prefixes.\\n■Both can be applied directionally (inbound and outbound) to a router’s interface.\\n■Both can match on transport layer protocol information such as TCP or UDP source or\\ndestination port numbers.\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  667\\n■Both can match on specific ICMP message types and codes.\\n■Both have an implicit deny statement at the end of the ACL that matches all remaining\\npackets.\\n■Both support time ranges for time-based ACLs.\\nOf course, there are key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs as well. IPv4 ACLs match \\nIPv4 packets only (and not IPv6), and match special fields found only in IPv4 headers. Likewise, IPv6 ACLs match against IPv6 address     fields as well as other fields unique to an IPv6 header. The following is a summary of the key differences:\\n■IPv4 ACLs can only match IPv4 packets and IPv6 ACLs can only match IPv6 packets.\\n■IPv4 ACLs can be identified by number or name, while IPv6 ACLs use names only.\\n■IPv4 ACLs identify that an ACL is either standard or extended based on the ACL num-\\nber range or by using the standard or extended keyword. IPv6 ACLs have a similar\\nstandard and extended ACL concept, but do not differentiate the styles with a differentconfiguration keyword.\\n■IPv4 ACLs can match on specific values unique to an IPv4 header (e.g., option, prece-\\ndence, ToS TTL, fragments).\\n■IPv6 ACLs can match on specific values unique to an IPv6 header (e.g., flow label, DSCP)\\nas well as extension and option header values.\\n■IPv6 ACLs have some implicit permit statements at the end of each ACL, just before the\\nimplicit deny all at the end of the ACL, while IPv4 ACLs do not have implicit permit\\nstatements.\\nACL Location and Direction\\nIPv6 ACLs, just like IPv4 ACLs, can be applied to any interface using that specific IP version \\nprotocol and can be applied to that interface in the inbound and the outbound direction. Furthermore, a router’s interface that is operating in dual-protocol mode with both IPv4 and IPv6 can have an inbound and outbound IPv4 ACL and an inbound and outbound IPv6 ACL on the interface. The IPv4 ACLs will have no filtering function on the IPv6 packets and, vice versa, the IPv6 ACLs will not affect any IPv4 packets on the interface.\\nWhen ACLs are used to perform security filtering at the edge of a network, the more \\nsecure configuration method is to use inbound ACLs applied to the router interface that faces the untrusted network. This puts the router into a position to block incoming packets before they enter any part of the network. The less secure method is to use outbound ACLs applied to the perimeter router’s internal interface. In this case, the router first computes the forwarding path, and then the ACL can block the packet before it begins to leave the inter-face. Furthermore, to filter packets leaving the trusted network, the best practice is to apply the ACL in the outbound direction on the interface that connects to the untrusted network. These best practices for ACLs also apply to IPv6 ACLs.\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 C 2 C 3 D 4 E 5 B\\nptg17396363668  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIPv6 Filtering Policies\\nChoosing what packets to permit     and deny—called the filtering policy—is the hard part \\nof building IPv6 ACLs. Configuring those filtering policies once they are chosen is the easy part. \\nMost security practitioners agree on the concept of having a “fail-safe stance” whereby fil-\\nters should only permit what is allowed and block all else. In other words, “that which is not permitted is blocked.” This is the default method of configuration for Cisco IOS ACLs and is no different when it comes to IPv6 ACLs. Each IPv6 ACL has an implied deny ipv6 any \\nany rule at the bottom, so that any packet that falls through the if-then-else rule base will be blocked by default.\\nWhen starting to create an IPv6 filter, you don’t just take your IPv4 policy and then change \\nthe addresses to IPv6 addresses and paste in the new policy. Because IPv4 and IPv6 operate in completely separate data planes, you cannot simply replace an IPv4 address with an IPv6 address in the policy and make it work. For starters, in most cases your IPv4 network is fully established and your IPv6 environment is just beginning to develop. It is more realistic to start a new IPv6 policy and allow only those services that you want to permit for IPv6. Your IPv6 filters will grow in size over time as your IPv6 deployment develops and you require more permit statements in the ACLs.\\nThe next step in creating an IPv6 ACL and filtering policy is to determine the types of IPv6 \\npackets that should be allowed. This depends on the location of the router performing the filtering and the nature of the interface that the ACL is being applied to. For example, an ACL applied to the inbound direction of an Internet-connected router’s external interface is much different than an ACL applied to the inbound direction of an internal data     center router connecting to a LAN containing servers.\\nICMPv6 Filtering Caution\\nFor the sake of the exams, this chapter focuses mostly on how to configure and verify IPv6 ACLs. However, it helps to think about some      more practical tips that will be of good use in production networks.\\nTaking an approach of explicitly filtering the traffic that should be allowed, and filtering all \\nother traffic, actually requires that the network engineer fully understand the protocols that flow through the router. As it turns out, with IPv6, some types of ICMPv6 messages need to be permitted by IPv6 ACLs, otherwise the ACL can prevent IPv6 packet forwarding from working correctly.\\nFirst, with ICMP for IPv4, many network engineers filter most ICMP messages as a mat-\\nter of habit. Many different attacks make use of ICMP for IPv4, and one way to deal with those attacks is to filter the messages. The temptation is to then do likewise and filter ICMPv6 messages.\\nSome ICMPv6 messages must be permitted by IPv6 ACLs. For instance, Neighbor \\nDiscovery Protocol (NDP) is part of ICMPv6. Additionally, endpoint hosts use a feature called   Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD), which requires ICMP messages to flow through the network. (The PMTUD feature discovers the maximum-length IPv6 packet that can flow between the source and destination host; if the host sends larger packets, IPv6 rout-ers discard those packets.) So, building IPv6 ACLs that filter the ICMPv6 messages used by PMTUD can prevent hosts from communicating over the IPv6 network.\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  669\\nTherefore, when building production IPv6 networks, allowing specific ICMPv6 message \\ntypes to traverse a router interface is an essential practice for facilitating end-to-end con-nectivity. Understanding the ICMPv6 types and codes and their functions is useful when creating IPv6 ACLs. For future reference, the    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the list of ICMPv6 parameters:\\nhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/icmpv6-parameters.xhtml\\nFor guidance on the types of IPv6 and ICMPv6 packets that should be permitted at these different locations, consult IETF RFC 4890, “Recommendations for Filtering ICMPv6 Messages in Firewalls,” and NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-119, “Guidelines for the Secure Deployment of IPv6.” These reference documents, found at the following URIs, provide real-world deployment guidance on the IPv6 packet types that should and must be dropped or allowed       on WAN or LAN interfaces:\\nhttps://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4890.txt\\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-119/sp800-119.pdf\\nCapabilities of IPv6 ACLs\\nEven though IPv6 shares many commonalities   with IPv4, there are subtle protocol differenc-\\nes that must be understood prior to configuring an IPv6 ACL. The way that IPv4 and IPv6 operate on a LAN is different. IPv4 utilizes LAN broadcast packets with Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). IPv6 uses multicast ICMPv6 messages with NDP. The IPv6 header includes fields such as the flow label and IPv6 uses extension headers for optional packet header functionality. This is different than IPv4’s header structure.\\nBecause ACLs are configured to match various elements of a packet header, IPv6 ACLs have \\ntheir own capabilities that should be understood. The following mentions some values that IPv6 ACLs on IOS routers can match in an IPv6 packet:\\n■Traffic class (e.g., DSCP, 0 to 63)\\n■Flow label (0 to 1048575)\\n■IPv6 Next Header field indicating extension header type/number\\n■Source and destination 128-bit IPv6 addresses\\n■Upper-layer header details: TCP or UDP port numbers, TCP flags SYN, ACK, FIN,\\nPUSH, URG, RST\\n■ICMPv6 type and code\\n■IPv6 extension header value and   type (hop-by-hop headers, routing headers, fragmenta-\\ntion headers, IPsec, destination options, among others)\\nLimitations of IPv6 ACLs\\nThere are several limitations of ACLs that you should take into consideration when planning and designing the router configurations. As mentioned previously, there are subtle nuances to how IPv6 is different than IPv4 that may affect how IPv6-enabled routers are configured. Following are the key limitations of IPv6 ACLs that you   should be aware of and take into consideration when creating your filtering policy.\\nptg17396363670  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nMatching Tunneled Traffic\\nIPv6 networks have a tendency to have    more tunnels in use than in IPv4 networks. There are \\nsituations where IPv6 packets are being transported over IPv4 networks. For instance, these packets are carried within generic routing encapsulation (GRE). However, today, native IPv6 connectivity is more ubiquitous, so tunnels are not needed to join islands of IPv6 over an ocean of IPv4. Regardless, IPv6 ACLs are unable to filter based on the details of the IPv6 packets tunneled in IPv4 packets. The limitations of filtering based on the encapsulated traf-fic within any type of encapsulated or tunneled traffic has always been a limitation of ACLs.\\nIPv4 Wildcard Mask and IPv6 Prefix Length\\nIPv4 ACLs use a mask for the wildcard for the IPv4 subnet that is matched. Typically an IPv4 access list might look like the following entry that matches packets destined to the 10.1.1.0/24 subnet:\\naccess-list 10 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255\\nHowever, those IPv4 wildcard mask bits do not have to be contiguous. It is possible, although not common, to have an IPv4 ACL that matches the IPv4 source or destination address using a noncontiguous wildcard mask. \\nWith IPv6, you create an IPv6 ACL with a    prefix length number value that indicates the \\nnumber of contiguous prefix mask bits. In an IPv6 ACL, the prefix length number repre-sents the number of contiguous bits that will be matched for that IPv6 address prefix. The syntax uses “slash” notation where the number after the slash indicates the number of bits of the prefix length. Therefore, you are only able to match on IPv6 address prefix and not use discontiguous masks with IPv6 ACLs. Furthermore, it is very common to have prefix lengths that are evenly divisible by 4 (e.g., /48, /52, /56, /60, /64) and nonstandard to have a prefix length that does not fall on a hex digit boundary.\\nACL Logging Impact\\nIt is important to remember that excessive logging can negatively impact router perfor-mance. The router’s CPU is involved when    a log entry is created. Therefore, any ACL entry that uses the log parameter and matches many packets per second could consume CPU resources on the router.\\nIn this chapter there are IPv6 ACL examples that use   the log keyword. This is for dem-\\nonstration purposes only, to validate that IPv6 packets match specific IPv6 ACL entries. \\nAlthough this may be a useful practice as the ACL is being created and tested, it may not be desirable to have a production ACL logging continuously.\\nWith IPv6 ACLs, the log messages are generated for the first packet that matches that ACL \\nentry. Subsequent ACL entry matches that are logged are generated on a 5-minute interval. This helps reduce the CPU impact, but is something to be aware of nonetheless.\\nRouter Originated Packets\\nIPv6 ACLs, like IPv4 ACLs, have the ability to match and    permit or deny packets traversing a router’s interface in the data plane. However, there are limitations to ACLs matching router-originated traffic. IPv6 and IPv4 ACLs applied to interfaces in the inbound direction will block packets entering the router. However, outbound ACLs will not match   packets that the router is originating.\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  671\\nNOTE The idea of routers bypassing outbound ACLs for router-generated packets is \\nthe same concept discussed in some depth in Chapter 17, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists,” in the section “ACL Interactions with Router-Generated Packets.”\\nConfiguring Standard IPv6 ACLs\\nThis section will show how to begin creating and testing simple examples of IPv6 ACLs. Demonstrations of this configuration process will use a network topology with two routers configured for IPv6 and two hosts connected to each of the router’s LAN segments. Figure 25-1 will be used for the subsequent configuration examples in this chapter, so you may find yourself referring back to this topology frequently while reading examples.\\nR2 R1G0/2 G0/1 G0/2 G0/1\\n::1 ::2 ::1 ::12001:db8:1111:12::/642001:db8:1111:1::/64\\nHost A Host B2001:db8:1111:2::/64\\nFigure 25-1 IPv6 ACL Example Network Topology\\nThe first thing you will notice when you first learn     the syntax differences between IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs is that IPv6 does not use any numbered ACLs. All IPv6 ACLs are named. As always, named ACLs allow you to use descriptive names that help you remember the ACL’s intended purpose. To begin creating an IPv6 ACL, we need to enter the first com-mand to name the ACL. After entering the first command and the ACL name, we then pro-ceed with creating the access control entries, sometimes referred to as ACEs. Example 25-1 shows the syntax to create an ACL.\\nExample 25-1 Configuring a Simple ACL \\nR1# configure terminal\\nR1(config)# ipv6 access-list ?\\n  WORD User selected string identifying this access list\\n  log-update  Control access list log updates\\nR1(config)# ipv6 access-list V6_ACL_IN\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# ?\\nIPv6 Access List configuration commands:\\n  default   Set a command to its defaults  deny      Specify packets to reject\\n  evaluate  Evaluate an access list\\n  exit Exit from access-list configuration mode\\n  no Negate a command or set its defaults  permit    Specify packets to forward\\n  remark    Access list entry comment\\n  sequence  Sequence number for this entry\\nptg17396363672  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 25-1 shows the creation of an IPv6 ACL with the name V6_ACL_IN. When the \\n? is entered at the ACL configuration prompt, the router shows all the possible commands within an ACL. The permit and deny commands are the most common, but you could also use remark statements to help document the ACLs. The sequence command allows you to \\ncreate or modify an ACL entry with a specific number whereby the ACL filtering is per-formed in order from the lowest sequence number to the highest sequence number. The no \\ncommand can be used to remove a specific ACL entry.\\nFollowing is the syntax for standard IPv6 ACL permit and deny statements. IPv6 supports \\nboth standard and extended ACLs, although the configuration does not identify an ACL as one or the other. IPv6 standard ACLs can match the source and destination IPv6     address fields, but no other parts of an IPv6 packet.\\n[permit | deny] ipv6 {source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress} {destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-address} [log]\\nThe permit and deny commands in an IPv6 ACL have     many similar concepts compared to \\na named IPv4 ACL’s permit or deny commands, just with some slight variations. From this \\ngeneric IPv6 permit command, you can see\\n■The ipv6 parameter is one example of the protocol keyword, and means that the ACL\\nwill match all IPv6 packets. Other options match a subset of IPv6 packets and include\\ntcp, udp, and icmp. These keywords mirror the ip, tcp, udp, and icmp keywords used in\\nIPv4 ACLs.\\n■The source and destination IP address fields, followed by a prefix length, define the IPv6\\nprefix, much like an IPv4 ACL’s combined subnet and wildcard mask field defines anIPv4 address range.\\n■The operator port-number parameters refer to the matching items such as the TCP and\\nUDP port numbers (for example, eq 80 to match the well-known port for HTTP), withmany of the same parameter keywords and values as used with IPv4. Note that as withIPv4, IPv6 ACLs require a protocol keyword of tcp or udp to allow the use of the opera-\\ntor keyword to match the TCP and UDP ports numbers used.\\n■The host address values (both source and destination) match a specific single IPv6\\naddress, much like the host address option used in IPv4 ACLs.\\nExample 25-2 continues Example 25-1, in which the IPv6 ACL with the name V6_ACL_IN \\nwas created, proceeding to create the ACL entries. This ACL is going to have a single permit statement that allows any IPv6 node to send IPv6 packets to R2’s LAN that contains host B (2001:db8:1111:2::/64). All other IPv6 packets will be implicitly dropped by this ACL. Once the ACL is created, then this ACL is applied to an IPv6-enabled     interface in the specific direction.\\nExample 25-2 Simple ACL\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# permit ipv6 any 2001:db8:1111:2::/64\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/2\\nR1(config-if)# ipv6 traffic-filter V6_ACL_IN in\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  673\\nIPv6 ACLs use the ipv6 traffic-filter command   to apply the ACL to a router interface in \\na specific direction. This is a different syntax than the familiar IPv4 ACL ip access-group command that is used to apply an IPv4 ACL to a router interface.\\nNow it is a good idea to verify that the IPv6 ACL was created in the configuration and \\nproperly applied to the interface. Example 25-3 demonstrates the show commands that will be used to inspect the configuration   steps performed.\\nExample 25-3 Validating Simple ACL Configuration\\nR1# show running-config \\nBuilding configuration...\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nhostname R1\\n! lines omitted for brevityinterface GigabitEthernet0/2\\n ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1111:1::1/64\\n ipv6 traffic-filter V6_ACL_IN in\\n! lines omitted for brevityipv6 access-list V6_ACL_IN\\n permit ipv6 any 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nR1# show ipv6 interface GigabitEthernet 0/2\\nGigabitEthernet0/2 is up, line protocol is up\\n  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::F816:3EFF:FEC0:21D \\n  No Virtual link-local address(es):  Global unicast address(es):\\n    2001:DB8:1111:1::1, subnet is 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 \\n! lines omitted for brevity\\n  Input features: Access List  Inbound access list V6_ACL_IN\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nR1# show ipv6 interface | include line|list\\nGigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up\\nGigabitEthernet0/2 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Inbound access list V6_ACL_IN\\nR1# show ipv6 access-list\\nIPv6 access list V6_ACL_IN\\n    permit ipv6 any 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64 sequence 10 \\nThe Example 25-3 command output shows that the commands are now within the global \\nconfiguration and the IPv6 ACL is applied to GigabitEthernet 0/2 in the inbound interface. The router’s interfaces are up and operational and the ACL has its one permit statement.\\nptg17396363674  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe next step in the process is to test sending IPv6 traffic through the ACL. Using a simple \\nping6 command from host A to host B will validate that the       packets are being allowed. Example 25-4 shows the output from host A successfully executing the ping6 command.\\nExample 25-4 Validating ping Command’s Packets Are Permitted by the ACL\\ncisco@HostA:~$ ping6 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f\\nPING 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f(2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f) 56 data \\n  bytes\\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f: icmp_seq=1 ttl=62 time=8.63 ms\\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f: icmp_seq=2 ttl=62 time=8.71 ms\\n64 bytes from 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f: icmp_seq=3 ttl=62 time=6.25 ms\\n^C\\n--- 2001:db8:1111:2:f816:3eff:fe9a:c89f ping statistics ---\\n3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2003ms\\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 6.257/7.869/8.712/1.142 ms\\ncisco@HostA:~$\\nThree ICMPv6 Echo Request messages   were sent and it appears that they were successfully \\nreceived and three ICMPv6 Echo Reply messages were returned. The next step is to check the IPv6 ACL on R1 and see how many packets have matched its single permit ACL entry. Example 25-5 shows the IPv6 ACL and shows that three packets have matched this ACL entry.\\nExample 25-5 Finding Counters of Packets That Matched the ACL\\nR1# show ipv6 access-list     \\nIPv6 access list V6_ACL_IN\\n    permit ipv6 any 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64 (3 matches) sequence 10\\nR1#\\nTo clear the IPv6 ACL traffic counters, use the     following command:\\nclear access-list counters V6_ACL_IN\\nConfiguring Extended IPv6 ACLs\\nThe previous section covered a simplified syntax for a standard IPv6 ACL. This section will \\nreview the additional types of packets that     extended IPv6 ACLs can match and the syntax for ACL configuration. Extended IPv6 ACLs can match on many more IPv6 header fields as well as ICMPv6 messages, TCP and UDP port numbers, and other IPv6 header items like IPv6 extension headers. Following is the complete syntax of an IPv6 ACL entry.\\n[permit | deny] protocol {source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress} [operator [port-number]] {destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-address} [operator [port-number]] [dest-option-type [doh-number | \\ndoh-type]] [dscp value] [flow-label value] [fragments] [log] [log-input] [mobility] \\n[mobility-type [mh-number | mh-type]] [reflect name [timeout value]] [routing] \\n[routing-type routing-number] [sequence value] [time-range name]\\nNOTE The next few pages show many details of IPv6 ACL syntax so that you can see the \\nlarge number of options. The upcoming Figure 25-2 reduces the complexity down to a few key values, similar to those used with IPv4 ACLs, more useful for preparing for the exam.\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  675\\nThe generic permit and deny command     shows the syntax for an extended IPv6 ACL. With \\nIPv6, the difference between standard and extended ACLs is subtle. There is no keyword that distinguishes an IPv6 ACL as either standard or extended. Instead, an extended IPv6 ACL simply uses more than the source and destination IPv6 address fields when matching. \\nIPv6 extended ACLs can match on many of the values within the IPv6 header. IPv6 ACLs \\ncan match on the DSCP value for QoS marking, the flow label, and the source and destina-tion IPv6 address. IPv6 extended ACLs have the ability to match not only on the source and destination IP addresses, but also on upper-layer protocol information. The next-header value in the IPv6 header indicates the number of the type of header that immediately fol-lows the IPv6 header. In many cases, this would be either a TCP or UDP header where the protocol value would be tcp or udp, respectively. However, it could also be an ICMPv6 packet or it could be an extension header that has been added between the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header. IPv6 extended ACLs can match on destination option headers, fragmentation headers, routing headers, and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) headers. (To extend your learning about additional IPv6 extension header types, search for and read a copy of IETF RFC 2460.)\\nBesides matching IPv6 packets, IPv6 ACLs can also match   ICMPv6 packets. ICMPv6 pack-\\nets are IPv6 packets that also include an ICMPv6 header. By specifying icmp as the protocol \\nkeyword in the IPv6 ACL entry, the command matches the subset of IPv6 packets that also have an ICMPv6 header. Using the icmp keyword also enables many filtering options for ICMPv6 packets. For IPv6 ACL entries that match on ICMPv6 message headers, the follow-ing     syntax defines how these ACL entries are configured:\\n[permit | deny] icmp { source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] { destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-address | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] [ icmp-\\ntype [icmp-code] | icmp-message ] [ dest-option-type [ doh-number | doh-type ] ] [ \\ndscp value ] [ flow-label value ] [fragments] [hbh] [log] [log-input] [mobility] [ \\nmobility-type [ mh-number | mh-type ] ] [routing] [ routing-type routing-number ] [ \\nsequence value ] [ time-range name ]\\nICMPv6 ACLs can match on the source and destination IPv6 addresses, but also the \\nICMPv6 type and code values. ICMPv6 ACLs can also match on many other IPv6 extension headers like IPv6 extended ACLs.\\nIt is possible to create an IPv6 ACL that matches TCP header values   including source and \\ndestination port numbers. It is possible, although uncommon, for an ACL to match on TCP flags such as ACK, FIN, PSH, RST, SYN, and URG. TCP IPv6 ACLs can also match the other IPv6 extension header values. Following is the syntax for an IPv6 ACL that uses the tcp value for the protocol allowing this ACL to permit or deny a TCP packet:\\n[permit | deny] tcp { source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] { destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-address | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] [ack] [ \\ndest-option-type [ doh-number | doh-type ] ] [ dscp value ] [established] [fin] [ \\nflow-label value ] [fragments] [hbh] [log] [log-input] [mobility] [ mobility-type [ \\nmh-number | mh-type ] ] [ neq { port | protocol } ] [psh] [ range { port | protocol } \\n] [ reflect name [ timeout value ] ] [routing ] [ routing-type routing-number ] [rst] \\n[ sequence value ] [syn] [ time-range name ] [urg]\\nIPv6 ACLs also have the ability to match   UDP packets. UDP packets do not have any of the \\nflow-control flags used in TCP packets, and as a result, the ACL syntax is simpler. However, \\nUDP IPv6 ACLs can still match on IPv6 extension header values. When the udp protocol \\nptg17396363676  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nvalue is used in an IPv6 ACL, the following syntax applies when creating an IPv6 ACL that \\ncan permit or deny a UDP packet:\\n[permit | deny] udp { source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] { destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-address | auth } [ operator [port-number] ] \\n[ dest-option-type [ doh-number | doh-type ] ] [ dscp value ] [ flow-label value ] \\n[fragments] [hbh] [log] [log-input] [mobility] [ mobility-type [ mh-number | mh-type \\n] ] [ neq { port | protocol } ] [ range { port | protocol } ] [ reflect name [ \\ntimeout value ] ] [routing] [ routing-type routing-number ] [ sequence  value ] [ \\ntime-range name ]\\nWhen creating an IPv6 ACL that permits or denies TCP or UDP packets based on port num-\\nbers, IPv6 packets use the same port numbers as IPv4 packets. Therefore, an IPv6 ACL that blocks Telnet services using TCP destination port 23 would use the same port number as the functionally equivalent IPv4 ACL. Look to Table 17-3 in Chapter 17 for a list of most     of the more common TCP and UDP port numbers.\\nFigure 25-2 points out some of the more common matching options specific to IPv6 \\nextended ACL permit and deny commands when using the tcp, udp, and icmp keywords. \\nWhen using any protocol keyword other than ipv6, the permit or deny command then matches a subset of IPv6 packets. For instance, using the tcp keyword as the protocol matches all IPv6 packets with a TCP header. Additionally, as with IPv4 ACLs, to match TCP port numbers, you must use the tcp keyword in the permit or deny command. Likewise, the command must use the udp keyword to match UDP port numbers, and the icmp keyword to then match ICMP     message types.\\n[icmp-type [icmp-code] | icmp-message]  [eq | gt | lt | neq {port | protocol}] [range {port | protocol}]    \\n [eq | gt | lt | neq {port | protocol}] [range {port | protocol}]Port Matching\\nPort Matching\\nICMP Message Typespermit tcp...\\npermit udp...\\npermit icmp...Command\\nCommand\\nCommand\\nFigure 25-2 ICMP, TCP, and UDP Matching Fields in Extended IPv6 ACLs\\nExamples of Extended IPv6 ACLs\\nConfiguring an extended IPv6 ACL is similar to configuring a standard IPv6 ACL, but the \\nACL syntax is more complex, allowing matching    of more types of packets.\\nThis example will use the same network topology as in the previous standard IPv6 ACL \\nexample, repeated here as Figure 25-3.

Then the ACL is applied inbound to the specific R2 router interface.

The next step will be to test performing an IPv6 ping from host A to host B, which should succeed because ICMPv6 Echo Request messages are permitted by this ACL and should be replied to with ICMPv6 Echo Reply messages. The two TCP connections were completed successfully as well. After generating these connec-tions on the hosts, the output in Example 25-7 was observed on R2, first with log messages, then      with the show ipv6 access-lists command.\\nptg17396363678  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 25-7 Check Counters on Extended ACL\\n*Mar  6 21:59:12.230: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list V6_APPS_ACL/10 permitted tcp\\n2001:DB8:1111:1:F816:3EFF:FEF6:7296(52239) -> 2001:DB8:1111:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:\\n5CF5(51234), 1 packet\\n*Mar  6 21:59:16.069: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list V6_APPS_ACL/10 permitted tcp\\n2001:DB8:1111:1:F816:3EFF:FEF6:7296(52240) -> 2001:DB8:1111:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:5CF5(51234), 1 packet\\n*Mar  6 21:59:17.798: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list V6_APPS_ACL/10 permitted tcp\\n2001:DB8:1111:1:F816:3EFF:FEF6:7296(52241) -> 2001:DB8:1111:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:5CF5(51234), 1 packet\\n*Mar  6 21:59:49.769: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list V6_APPS_ACL/20 permitted tcp\\n2001:DB8:1111:1:F816:3EFF:FEF6:7296(57199) -> 2001:DB8:1111:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:5CF5(22), 1 packet\\n*Mar  6 22:13:07.326: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGDP: list V6_APPS_ACL/40 permitted icmpv6\\n2001:DB8:1111:1:F816:3EFF:FEF6:7296 -> 2001:DB8:1111:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:5CF5 (128/0), 1 packet\\nR2# show ipv6 access-list\\nIPv6 access list V6_APPS_ACL\\n    permit tcp 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64 eq 51234 log (15 matches) \\nsequence 10\\n    permit tcp 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64 eq 22 log (34 matches) \\nsequence 20\\n    permit icmp 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64 echo-request log (3 matches) \\nsequence 30\\nR2#\\nBecause both entries of the IPv6 extended ACL are using the log keyword, R2 observes via \\nconsole-level logging that connections were made on both TCP port 51234 and port 22 and that the ping worked.

First, the follow-\\ning list summarizes some important tips to consider when         choosing matching parameters to any ipv6 access-list permit or deny ACL entries:\\n■To match a specific address, just list the address after the host keyword.\\n■To match any and all addresses, use the any keyword.\\n■To match based only on the IPv6 prefix, use the “slash” notation to designate the num-\\nber of bits in the prefix length. For example, a /64 prefix length matches the first 64 bits\\nof the 128-bit IPv6 address, and any Interface Identifier (IID) within the least-significant64 bits of that address falls within that prefix range.\\nTable 25-2 lists the criteria for several practice problems. Your job: Create a one-line stan-\\ndard ACL that matches the packets. The answers are listed in the final section of this chap-ter, “Answers to Earlier Practice Problems.”\\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  679\\nTable 25-2  Building Permit and Deny Extended IPv6 ACLs: Practice\\nProblem Criteria\\n1 Permit IPv6 packets from any address to the 2001:db8:45::/48 prefix\\n2 Permit and log IPv6 packets from the host 2001:db8:1:1::234 to the IPv6 network \\n2001:db8:1111:1111::/64\\n3 Permit any HTTP packets from anywhere to the web server with the IPv6 address \\n2001:db8:12:34::100\\n4 Permit and log HTTPS packets from host 2001:db8:11:22::1 to host \\n2001:db8:33:44::1\\n5 Permit Secure Shell (SSH) to the router with the IPv6 address 2001:db8:12:34::16 Permit ICMPv6 Echo Request packets from anywhere to the IPv6 network prefix \\n2001:db8:1111::/48\\n7 Permit IPv6 multicast packets sourced from any address    \\nOther IPv6 ACL Topics\\nThis last major section of the chapter discusses two topics that apply to both standard and \\nextended IPv6 ACLs. First, IPv6 ACLs apply several implicit rules at the end of each ACL. The first topic in this section discusses the protocols matched by those rules and then shows what those implicit rules are. The second topic examines how to use IPv6 ACLs to control access to a router using IPv6 Telnet and SSH.\\nImplicit IPv6 ACL Rules\\nEvery ACL has the default fail-safe stance whereby any packet that is not permitted is implicitly dropped. At the end of each IPv6 ACL is an implicit deny ipv6 any any statement \\nthat catches any packet that falls through the list unmatched, much like the implicit deny ip \\nany any found at the end of IPv4 ACLs.\\nIPv6 requires the use of ICMPv6 to properly function, and multicast is a necessary forward-\\ning method on each IPv6-enabled LAN. Unfortunately, that implicit deny all at the end of IPv6 ACLs would otherwise filter those ICMPv6 and multicast packets.\\nBy way of review, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is a part of ICMPv6. As intro-\\nduced in the ICND1 100-105 Cert Guide, Chapter 31, NDP includes neighbor discovery with the NDP Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages, as well as the Router Solicitation (RS) and Router Advertisement (RA) messages. Therefore, network engineers are unable to be overly aggressive with IPv6 ACLs to block ICMPv6 and multicast connections. However, in previous IPv6 ACL examples, the configuration did not explicitly allow IPv6 NDP messages to flow through the IPv6 ACLs configured earlier in this chapter. This section works through understanding what IOS does to make sure those ICMP messages flow correctly.\\nAn Example of Filtering ICMPv6 NDP and the Negative Effects\\nTo get a better understanding, let’s try a little       experiment to test this. Instead of relying on the implicit statements at the end of an IPv6 ACL, what would happen if an IPv6 ACL explicitly blocked all ICMPv6 and blocked all IPv6 multicast? The next three examples answer that question. Examples 25-8 and 25-9 show the background, with no ACLs used \\nptg17396363680  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nat all, showing the information learned by ICMPv6’s NDP protocols. Example 25-10 then \\nshows an ACL that blocks all ICMPv6 and all IPv6 multicast packets, to see how that filter-ing affects a network.\\nThis series of examples uses the network topology shown in Figure 25-4, which is the same \\ntopology shown previously in this chapter in Figures 25-1 and 25-3. Example 25-8 validates that Router R1 has a properly discovered IPv6 NDP neighbor cache. It also shows that R1’s GigabitEthernet 0/1 interface is functioning properly with multicast and it is receiving RA messages from Router R2.\\nR2 R1G0/2\\nG0/1G0/2G0/1\\n::1 ::1\\nHost A Host BFE80::F816:3EFF:FEED:95B8\\n2001:DB8:1111:12::1\\nFE80::F816:3EFF:FE25:563A2001:DB8:1111:12::2\\nFigure 25-4 Network Used to Examine How ACLs Filter ICMP NDP\\nExample 25-8 Check IPv6 NDP on R1\\nR1# show ipv6 interface GigabitEthernet 0/1\\nGigabitEthernet0/1 is up, line protocol is up\\n  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::F816:3EFF:FE25:563A \\n  No Virtual link-local address(es):\\n  Global unicast address(es):    2001:DB8:1111:12::1, subnet is 2001:DB8:1111:12::/64 \\n  Joined group address(es):\\n    FF02::1\\n    FF02::2    FF02::1:FF00:1\\n    FF02::1:FF25:563A\\n! lines omitted for brevity\\nR1# show ipv6 neighbors GigabitEthernet0/1\\nIPv6 Address Age Link-layer Addr State Interface\\n2001:DB8:1111:12::2 11 fa16.3eed.95b8  STALE Gi0/1\\nFE80::F816:3EFF:FEED:95B8 11 fa16.3eed.95b8  STALE Gi0/1\\nR1# show ipv6 routersRouter FE80::F816:3EFF:FEED:95B8 on GigabitEthernet0/1, last update 2 min\\n  Hops 64, Lifetime 1800 sec, AddrFlag=0, OtherFlag=0, MTU=1500\\n  HomeAgentFlag=0, Preference=Medium  Reachable time 0 (unspecified), Retransmit time 0 (unspecified)\\n  Prefix 2001:DB8:1111:12::/64 onlink autoconfig\\n    Valid lifetime 2592000, preferred lifetime 604800\\nExample 25-8 reveals that R1 knows two IPv6 neighbor addresses in its neighbor \\ncache, both of which are Router R2.

The show ipv6 \\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  681\\nrouters command output confirms that R1 has learned of one other IPv6 router (also R2). \\nThis command lists information learned by NDP, in this case confirming that R1 is receiving the RA messages that R2 is sending out from its GigabitEthernet 0/1 interface.

The show ipv6 neighbors command     lists R1’s global unicast and link-local addresses, both of which Router R2 would have learned by receiving ICMPv6 NDP NA messages. The show ipv6 routers command output confirms that R2 has learned about R1, with R2 learning this information by receiving an ICMPv6 NDP RA mes-sage.\\nExample 25-10 shows the addition of an IPv6 ACL that prevents the two routers from learn-\\ning from each other using ICMPv6 NDP. The example shows the configuration of an IPv6 ACL will block ICMPv6 packets and block all multicast traffic, but allow all other IPv6 packets. This extended IPv6 ACL will be applied inbound on R1’s GigabitEthernet 0/1 inter-face and inbound on R2’s GigabitEthernet 0/1 interface. After the ACLs are configured, the ACL will be checked that they are in the running configuration and operational. Following       is the configuration on R1. R2’s configuration is identical to R1’s.\\nptg17396363682  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 25-10 Configuring IPv6 Blocking ACL on R1\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

NDP RA and RS messages are part of ICMPv6, so those mes-sages match the first line of the ACL. Even if they had not, NDP RA messages are sent to the all-nodes multicast group address (FF02::1). Routers periodically send RA messages, typ-ically every 200 seconds, to inform nodes on the network about the local network charac-teristics and about the method for IPv6 address allocation. Router Solicitation (RS) ICMPv6 messages are sent to the all-routers multicast group address (FF02::2). When a node boots up or joins the network, it immediately sends an RS message to the local router to find out about the network and to determine the method it should use to acquire its IPv6 address. The deny commands that list       address FF00::/8 would match all multicast addresses.\\nNote that blocking all multicast IPv6 packets, as is done with the ACL in Example 25-10, can have a big negative impact on router operation. If the BLOCKV6 ACL is blocking mul-ticast packets, then it will inadvertently block other link-local multicasts such as: OSPFv3 (FF02::5, FF02::6), RIPng (FF02::9), EIGRP for IPv6 (FF02::A), and DHCPv6 (FF02::1:2, FF05::1:3). To further explore other well-known registered IPv6 multicast addresses, you can extend your learning and refer to the      IANA IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry at the following URI. (Or refer to the ICND1 Cert Guide’s Chapter 30, section “Local Scope Multicast Addresses.”)\\nhttp://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml\\nThe sample BLOCKV6 ACL will also prevent the two routers from learning each other’s IPv6 addresses, which actually prevents the two routers from successfully forwarding pack-ets to each other. The first line in the ACL will prevent all ICMPv6 messages, including all \\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  683\\nNDP NS and NA messages. Even without the   deny icmp any any command, the ACL would \\nfilter NS and NA based on the addresses used. NS ICMPv6 messages are sent to the solic-ited node multicast address (FF02:0:0:0:0:1:FF00::/104) of the destination node on the LAN. (NA ICMPv6 messages are sent back, typically to the unicast address of the node that sent the original NS packet.) \\nNow that this ACL is applied, it will block all ICMPv6   and multicast packets on this inter-\\nface. After waiting for over 5 minutes, the neighbor cache and the router cache on the two routers can be inspected, as shown in Example 25-11. The observation shows that the neigh-bor cache entries on the interface have timed out and the RA cache is very old. In fact, now host A and host B are unable to ping each other because the connectivity       between R1 and R2 has been disrupted by these two IPv6 ACLs.\\nExample 25-11 Checking IPv6 Blocking ACL on R1\\nR1# show ipv6 neighbors GigabitEthernet 0/1\\nR1# show ipv6 routers\\nRouter FE80::F816:3EFF:FEED:95B8 on GigabitEthernet0/1, last update 17 min\\n  Hops 64, Lifetime 1800 sec, AddrFlag=0, OtherFlag=0, MTU=1500\\n  HomeAgentFlag=0, Preference=Medium  Reachable time 0 (unspecified), Retransmit time 0 (unspecified)\\n  Prefix 2001:DB8:1111:12::/64 onlink autoconfig\\n    Valid lifetime 2592000, preferred lifetime 604800\\nExample 25-12 shows the output from R2 validating       the contents of the neighbor cache and \\nthe router cache.\\nExample 25-12 Checking IPv6 Blocking ACL on R2\\nR2# show ipv6 neighbors GigabitEthernet 0/1\\nR2# show ipv6 routers\\nRouter FE80::F816:3EFF:FE25:563A on GigabitEthernet0/1, last update 15 min\\n  Hops 64, Lifetime 1800 sec, AddrFlag=0, OtherFlag=0, MTU=1500\\n  HomeAgentFlag=0, Preference=Medium  Reachable time 0 (unspecified), Retransmit time 0 (unspecified)\\n  Prefix 2001:DB8:1111:12::/64 onlink autoconfig\\n    Valid lifetime 2592000, preferred lifetime 604800\\nHow to Avoid Filtering ICMPv6 NDP Messages\\nNetwork administrators must be careful when creating IPv6 ACLs that are filtering ICMPv6 \\nmessages and multicast packets so that the ACLs are not inadvertently stopping NDP from functioning properly. This is why it is important, on any interface, to permit NDP        to oper-ate. In other words, you should not filter ICMPv6 and multicast on a wholesale level.\\nFor this very reason, Cisco IOS IPv6 ACLs have three implicit rules at the bottom of each \\nACL. These are invisible, but they are included at the end of each IPv6 ACL so as to implic-itly permit NA and NS messages. The final     implicit IPv6 ACL statement is the default deny that is commonly expected. The three implicit IPv6 ACL rules at the bottom of every ACL are shown in Example 25-13.\\nptg17396363684  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 25-13 Implicit IPv6 ACL Entries\\npermit icmp any any nd-na\\npermit icmp any any nd-ns\\ndeny ipv6 any any\\nNote that these defaults do permit NDP NS and NA messages, but do not include an implic-\\nit permit of NDP RS and         RA messages. If you wanted to add explicit statements to an ACL to match RS and RA messages, you could use commands like permit icmp any any router-advertisement and permit icmp any any router-solicitation. \\nNOTE Even though CCNA R&S does not get into Cisco’s IOS XE and NX-OS operating systems, on a practical note, they do use slightly different defaults. IOS-XE has no default permit of NS/NA packets, so you would need to add explicit permit commands at the \\nend of each IPv6 ACL so as to not inadvertently affect NDP functionality. NX-OS has five implicit IPv6 ACL statements: one for NA messages, one for NS messages, one for RA mes-sages, one for RS messages, and the final implicit default deny rule.\\nBecause of these implicit IPv6 ACL rules allowing NA/NS messages, it is important to remember to change our ACLs if required to use a deny-log at the end of the policy. Therefore, if the desire is to create an ACL that logs all denied IPv6        packets, the IPv6 ACL would need to be configured like Example 25-14.\\nExample 25-14 Explicitly Allowing NDP in IPv6 ACL\\nR1(config)# ipv6 access-list MY_IPV6_ACL\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# permit ipv6 any 2001:db8:1111:1::/64\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# permit ipv6 any 2001:db8:1111:2::/64\\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# permit icmp any any nd-na \\nR1(config-ipv6-acl)# permit icmp any any nd-ns R1(config-ipv6-acl)# deny ipv6 any any log\\nIn Example 25-14, this IPv6 ACL has explicit entries to permit NA and NS messages. Even \\nthough it does not explicitly permit RA messages, this ACL, if applied in the outbound direction, will not block the sending of RA messages because they are originated by the router. Similar to IPv4 ACLs, packets originating from the router will not be affected by an outbound interface IPv6 ACL. However, if this ACL is applied in the inbound direction, it will block RA messages from being received on this router’s interface.\\nIPv6 ACL Implicit Filtering Summary\\nThere are many ways that IPv6 packets        can be used. Basic IPv6 ACLs can be used simply to filter communications between specific IPv6 hosts or IPv6 address prefixes. Extended IPv6 ACLs have the ability to match ICMPv6, TCP, UDP, or other IPv6 header fields and exten-sion headers.\\nIt is important to remember that IPv6 operations are different from IPv4 operations across \\na WAN or the Internet and that ACLs should not be overly aggressive at filtering ICMPv6 messages. It is also important to remember that ICMPv6 is critical to LAN connectivity and \\nptg1739636325Chapter 25: IPv6 Access Control Lists  685\\nthat ACLs should not block NDP messages to access nodes or between directly connected \\nrouters. There are implicit rules in IPv6 ACLs that can help us remember to permit these important IPv6 packet types.\\nIPv6 Management Control ACLs\\nIPv6 ACLs can be used for security purposes other than filtering data-plane traffic that passes through the router. ACLs can    also be used to help harden the router from a security perspective and control the management-plane communications to the router.\\nSeldom do routers have fully out-of-band management network access, and frequently rout-\\ners are configured in-band. To limit the exposure and restrict the management and configu-ration interaction with a router, ACLs can be used to filter these connections.\\nIPv6 ACLs can be applied to many other management functions of a router. IPv6 ACLs \\ncan be used to restrict SNMP communications, RADIUS, TACACS+, HTTP/HTTPS access, NTP, and Telnet/SSH CLI access. An example of how an IPv6 ACL can be used to restrict management access is when it is used with an IPv6 access class. This is when an ACL is used to filter IPv6 Telnet and/or SSH login connections.\\nIn Example 25-15, the IPv6 ACL is created to restrict the     IPv6 addresses of the authorized \\nmanagement workstations on R1’s LAN. This ACL will be applied to the VTY ports on R1 and R2 using the ipv6 access-class command. This is similar to the familiar IPv4 command ip access-class. Example 25-15 shows the configuration that is applied to R2, but R1’s con-figuration is identical.\\nExample 25-15 Configuring IPv6 Access ACL on R2\\nR2# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\\nR2(config)# ipv6 access-list V6ACCESS\\nR2(config-ipv6-acl)# permit tcp 2001:db8:1111:1::/64 any eq 23\\nR2(config-ipv6-acl)# permit tcp 2001:db8:1111:1::/64 any eq 22R2(config-ipv6-acl)# deny ipv6 any any log\\nR2(config-ipv6-acl)# line vty 0 4 \\nR2(config-line)# login \\nR2(config-line)# password ciscoR2(config-line)# transport input telnet ssh\\nR2(config-line)# ipv6 access-class V6ACCESS in\\nR2(config-line)# end\\nIn Example 25-15, the IPv6 ACL is configured and applied to the VTY ports. At this point, \\nit is time to test this ACL. It is now possible to telnet from host A to both R1 and R2, but host B is disallowed from connecting to either router with Telnet.\\nExample 25-16 shows the attempt of host B to Telnet to R1, which failed as shown in the \\nlog message. The example also shows that the IPv6 ACL had        matches for the connections from host A.\\nptg17396363686  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample 25-16 Checking IPv6 Access ACL on R1\\n*Mar  6 23:31:19.926: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list V6ACCESS/30 denied tcp 2001:DB8:111\\n1:2:F816:3EFF:FEE1:5CF5(34474) -> 2001:DB8:1111:1::1(23), 1 packet\\nR1# show ipv6 access-list\\nIPv6 access list V6ACCESS\\n    permit tcp 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 any eq telnet (2 matches) sequence 10\\n    permit tcp 2001:DB8:1111:1::/64 any eq 22 sequence 20\\n    deny ipv6 any any log (1 match) sequence 30\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

Chapter 22 focuses on how to troubleshoot IPv6 routing (forwarding) problems, while Chapters 23 and 24 focus on the root causes that prevent OSPFv3 and EIGRP, respectively, from exchanging routing information. Chapter 25 also discusses troubleshooting, but more from the perspective that IPv6 ACLs can be the root cause of IPv6 routing and routing protocol issues.\\nFor this first mind map, try to collect all root causes of problems in an IPv6 network and \\norganize those into a mind map. As usual, use short reminders, rather than long descriptions, with just enough information for you to remember the meaning. Also, organize the concepts in a way that makes sense to you. And avoid looking at the chapters when first building these; as usual, the point is to help you organize the ideas in your own head, rather than to read lists from the book again.Part VI Review\\nptg17396363Create Commands Mind Map\\nThis part also discussed OSPF for IPv6, EIGRP for IPv6, and IPv6 ACL configuration and \\nverification. It also reviewed a wide variety of IPv6 configuration commands in Chapter 22. Create a command mind map, like in many other part reviews. The first level of organization should be for OSPF for IPv6, EIGRP for IPv6, and IPv6 ACLs. For the rest of the IPv6 commands (from Chapter 22), organize them to your own liking. Inside each of those categories, break the organization into configuration versus verification commands.\\nDVD Appendix E, “Mind Map Solutions,” lists sample mind map answers.

So, do not just configure the ACL; make an ACL that can match these types of traffic, denying some and permitting others, and then test. \\nptg17396363Part VII is the final part of the book that introduces new content, so congratulations on \\nworking through most of the book!\\nThis part collects topics that do not fit neatly into any of the other parts of the book. The \\nfirst chapter, Chapter 26, discusses the implementation details of three different topics related to operating networks: SNMP, IP SLA, and SPAN. This chapter gets into specifics about concepts, configuration, verification, and some troubleshooting.\\nAs much as Chapter 26 gets into small implementation details, the other two chapters \\ninstead focus on big ideas. Chapter 27 discusses many big ideas about a cloud computing approach to offering IT services. Cloud computing goes far beyond any one tool, or any one feature in a device. It is a chapter that requires you to slow down a bit and ponder while you read. \\nChapter 28 is like Chapter 27 in that it requires a little more pondering rather than memo-\\nrizing small details. Chapter 28 explains the fundamentals of network programmability and Software Defined Networking (SDN), with just enough detail so you can begin to learn more about this exciting new area of networking.\\nptg17396363Part VII\\nMiscellaneous\\nChapter 26:  Network Management\\nChapter 27:  Cloud Computing\\nChapter 28:  SDN and Network Programmability\\nPart VII Review\\nptg17396363\\nCHAPTER 26\\nNetwork Management\\nThis chapter covers the following exam topics:\\n5.0 Infrastructure Maintenance\\n5.1 Configure and verify device-monitoring protocols\\n5.1.a SNMPv2\\n5.1.b SNMPv3\\n5.2 Troubleshoot network connectivity issues using ICMP echo-based IP SLA5.3 Use local SPAN to troubleshoot and resolve problems\\nThis chapter discusses three major topics that are related by their theme. However, they \\nhave no direct impact on each other. From a study perspective, you can treat each of the major headings as a separate study task. In fact, because this chapter is rather long compared to other chapters, I would suggest breaking down the topics in this chapter by major head-ing, just so the new terminology does not get in the way.\\nThis chapter begins with a detailed discussion of   Simple Network Management Protocol \\n(SNMP). The discussion begins with the core concepts, and moves on to configuration for two versions: SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. These versions differ significantly with their security features, so much of the configuration discussion revolves around sorting out those details.\\nThe second section moves to a router-specific feature called IP Service Level Agreement (IP \\nSLA). This tool lets network engineers configure routers so that the routers generate artifi-cial probe traffic to send into the network. By sending the messages and receiving respons-es, the routers can measure availability and performance.\\nThe final section then discusses a switch-specific feature: Switched Port Analyzer, or SPAN. \\nThis tool allows the network engineer to make the switch copy frames to a destination port. This feature is useful to direct frames to different kinds of networking tools, like network analyzer software.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

The   superb idea behind this document was the fact that information about devices on a TCP/IP-based network—con-figuration settings, status information, counters, and so on—could be broken down into a database of variables. Those variables could then be collected by management software \\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  695\\nto monitor and manage the IP-based network. After all, the elements of any IP-based \\nmachines would have commonalities. For example, a PC, a network printer, and a router would all have commonalities such as interfaces, IP addresses, and buffers. Why not create a standardized database of these variables and a simple system for monitoring and manag-ing them? This idea was brilliant, caught on, and became what we know today as    Simple \\nNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP).\\nThis first major section of the chapter begins by explaining the concepts and terminology \\nsurrounding SNMP, along with how to configure the two most commonly used versions: SNMPv2c and SNMPv3. \\nSNMP Concepts\\nSimple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an    application layer protocol that pro-vides a message format for communication between what are termed managers and agents. An SNMP manager is a network management application running on a PC or server, with that host typically being called a   Network Management Station (NMS). Many SNMP agents exist in the network, one per device that is managed. The SNMP agent    is software running inside each device (router, switch, and so on), with knowledge of all the variables on that device that describe the device’s configuration, status, and counters. The SNMP manager uses SNMP protocols to communicate with each SNMP agent.\\nEach agent keeps a database of variables that make up the parameters, status, and counters \\nfor the operations of the device. This database, called the    Management Information Base (MIB), has some core elements in common across most networking devices. It also has a large number of variables unique to that type of device—for instance, router MIBs will include variables not needed on switch MIBs, and vice versa. (For perspective, I did a quick check on a router when writing this section, and found a little over 7000 MIB variables on a router running a 15.4M version of IOS.)\\nFigure 26-1 connects a few of these ideas and terms together. First, many companies \\nsell SNMP management products. The Cisco Prime series   of management products (http://www.cisco.com/go/prime) uses SNMP (and other protocols) to manage networks. IOS on routers and switches include an SNMP agent, with built-in MIB, that can be enabled with the configuration shown later in this chapter.\\nThe SNMP Manager\\n(i.e. Cisco Prime)The Cisco Router and\\nSNMP Agent SoftwareThe MIB\\nFigure 26-1 Elements of Simple Network Management Protocol\\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B 2 A, C 3 D 4 A 5 C 6 A, B 7 C 8 A, C\\nptg17396363696  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSNMP Variable Reading and Writing: SNMP Get and Set\\nThe NMS typically polls the SNMP    agent on each device. The NMS can notify the human \\nuser in front of the PC, or send emails, texts, and so on to notify the network operations staff of any issues identified by the data found by polling the devices. You can even recon-figure the device through these SNMP variables in the MIB if you permit this level of con-trol. \\nSpecifically, the NMS uses the      SNMP Get, GetNext, and GetBulk messages (together ref-\\nerenced simply as Get messages) to ask for information from an agent. The NMS sends an SNMP Set message     to write variables on the SNMP agent as a means to change the configu-ration of the device. These messages come in pairs, with, for instance, a Get Request asking the agent for the contents of a variable, and the Get Response supplying that information. Figure 26-2 shows an example of a typical flow, with the NMS using an SNMP Get to ask for the MIB variable that describes the status of a particular router interface.\\nSNMP Get Request\\nRouter 1Gi0/0The MIBI want to check the MIB variable \\nto find out if Gi0/0 is UP/UP\\nSNMP Get Response21\\nFigure 26-2 SNMP Get Request and Get Response Message Flow\\nSNMP permits much      flexibility in how you monitor variables in the MIB. Most commonly, \\na network administrator gathers and stores statistics over time using the NMS. The NMS, with the stored data, can then analyze various statistical facts such as averages, minimums, and maximums. To be proactive, administrators can set thresholds for certain key variables, telling the NMS to send a notification (email, text, and so on) when a threshold is passed. \\nSNMP Notifications: Traps and Informs\\nIn addition to asking for information           with Get commands, and setting variables on agents with the Set command, SNMP agents can initiate communications to the NMS. These mes-sages, generally called notifications, use two specific SNMP messages: Trap and Inform. SNMP agents send a Trap or Inform SNMP message to the NMS to list the state of certain MIB variables when those variables reach a certain state. \\nAs an example of a Trap, suppose that Router 1’s G0/0 interface fails, as shown at Step 1 of \\nFigure 26-3. With Traps configured, the router would send an SNMP Trap message to the NMS, with that Trap message noting the down state of the G0/0 interface. Then, the NMS software can send a text message to the network support staff, pop up a window on the NMS screen, change to red the color of the correct router icon on the graphical interface, and so on.\\nSNMP Traps and Inform messages have the exact same purpose, but differ in the protocol \\nmechanisms. SNMP Traps, available since the first version of SNMP from the late 1980s (SNMP Version 1, or SNMPv1), use a fire-and-forget process. The SNMP agent sends the Trap to the IP address of the NMS, with UDP as the transport protocol as with all SNMP messages, and with no application layer error recovery. If the Trap arrives, great; if it is lost in transit, it is lost. \\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  697\\nSNMP Trap\\nRouter 1The MIBMy Gi0/0 Interface Failed!\\nTake a Look!Send text, Turn Red, Etc.\\n3\\n2\\n1Gi0/0\\nFigure 26-3 SNMP Trap Notification Process\\nInform messages are like Trap messages but with reliability added. Added to the protocol \\nwith SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2), Informs still use UDP, but add application layer reliabil-ity. The NMS must acknowledge receipt of the Inform or the SNMP agent will time out and resend the Inform.\\nNote that Traps and Informs both have a useful role today, and Traps are still frequently \\nused. Both inform the NMS. Traps use less overhead on the agent, while           Informs improve reliability of the messages but require a little more overhead effort.\\nThe Management Information Base\\nEvery SNMP agent     has its own Management Information Base. The MIB defines variables whose values are set and updated by the agent. The MIB variables on the devices in the net-work enable the management software to monitor/control the network device. \\nMore formally, the MIB defines each variable as       an object ID (OID). On most devices, the \\nMIB then organizes the OIDs based in part on RFC standards, and in part with vendor-proprietary variables. The MIB organizes all the variables into a hierarchy of OIDs, usu-ally shown as a tree. Each node in the tree can be described based on the tree structure sequence, either by name or by number. Figure 26-4 shows a small part of the tree structure of a MIB that happens to be part of the Cisco-proprietary part of the MIB.\\nWorking directly with a MIB, with long variable names and numbers, can be a bit of a \\nchallenge, so NMS software typically hides the complexity of the MIB variable number-ing and names. However, to get a sense for the variable names, Figure 26-4 shows the tree structure for two variables, with the variable names being       the long string of numbers shown at the bottom of the figure. Working with those numbers and the tree structure can be difficult at best. As a result, most people manage their networks using an NMS such as Cisco Prime. For perspective, you could use an SNMP manager and type a MIB variable 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58.0 and click a button to get that variable, to see the current CPU usage percentage from a Cisco router. However, most users of an NMS would much prefer to ignore those details, and have a simple graphical interface to ask for the same information, never having to know that 1.3.6.1.4.9.2.1.58.0 represents the router     CPU utilization MIB variable.  \\nptg17396363698  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\niso (1).\\norg (3).\\ndod (6).\\ninternet (1).\\nprivate (4).\\nenterprises (1).\\ncisco (9).\\nlocal variables (2).\\ninterface group (2).cisco mgmt (9).\\ncisco flash group (10).\\n1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.2 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.10\\nFigure 26-4 Management Information Base (MIB)\\nSecuring SNMP \\nSNMP supports a few    security mechanisms, depending in part on the particular version. This \\nsection works through the options.\\nFirst, one strong method to secure SNMP is to use ACLs to limit SNMP messages to those \\nfrom known servers only. SNMP    agents on Cisco routers and switches support SNMP mes-sages that flow in both IPv4 and IPv6 packets. The SNMP agent can configure an IPv4 ACL to filter incoming SNMP messages that arrive in IPv4 packets, and an IPv6 ACL to filter SNMP messages that arrive in IPv6 packets.\\nUsing an IPv4 and IPv6 ACL to secure an agent makes good sense. The only hosts that \\nshould be sending SNMP messages to the SNMP agent in a router or switch are the NMS hosts. Those NMS hosts seldom change and their IP addresses should be well known to the networking staff. It makes good sense to configure an ACL that permits packets sourced from the IP addresses of all NMS hosts, but no others.\\nAs for the SNMP protocol messages, all versions of SNMP support a basic     clear-text pass-\\nword mechanism, although none of those versions refer to the mechanism as using a pass-word. SNMP Version 3 (SNMPv3) adds more modern security as well.\\nSNMPv1 defined clear-text passwords called   SNMP communities. Basically, both the \\nSNMP agent and the SNMP manager need prior knowledge of the same SNMP community value (called a community string). The SNMP Get messages and the Set message include the appropriate community   string value, in clear text. If the NMS sends a Get or Set with the correct community string, as configured on the SNMP agent, the agent processes the message.\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  699\\nSNMPv1 defines both a read-only community and a read-write community. The read-only \\n(RO) community allows           Get messages, and the read-write (RW) community allows both \\nreads and writes (Gets and Sets). Figure 26-5       shows the concepts. At Steps 1 and 2, the agent is configured with particular RO and RW community strings and the NMS configures the matching values. At Step 3, the SNMP Get can flow with either community, but   at Step 4, the Set Request must use the RW community. \\nR1 RO Pass1\\nR1 RW Pass2R1 RO Pass1R1 RW Pass2NMS\\nGet (Pass1 or Pass2 Works)\\nR1 Set (Pass2 Only Works)\\n2 13\\n4\\nFigure 26-5 RO and RW Communities with the Get and Set Commands\\nSNMPv2, and the related Community-based SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2c), added a wrinkle \\nin naming, but basically kept the same community        security feature as SNMPv1 once the standards process completed. The original specifications for SNMPv2 did not include communities. However, the marketplace still wanted communities, so an additional RFC added the communities mechanism back to SNMPv2. This updated RFC, Community-based SNMPv2, came to be known simply as SNMPv2c. Vendors (including Cisco) implemented SNMPv2c. \\nSNMPv3 arrived    with much celebration among network administrators. Finally, security had \\narrived with the powerful network management protocol. SNMPv3 does away with commu-nities, and replaces them with the following features: \\n■Message integrity: This mechanism, applied to all SNMPv3 messages, confirms whether\\nor not each message has been changed during transit.\\n■Authentication: An optional feature   that adds authentication with both a username andpassword, with the password never sent as clear text. Instead, it uses a hashing methodlike many other modern authentication processes.\\n■Encryption (privacy): An optional feature that encrypts the contents of SNMPv3 mes-sages, so that attackers who intercept the messages        cannot read their contents.\\nImplementing SNMP Version 2c\\nThe exam topics mention SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 by name. As it turns out, SNMPv1 and \\nSNMPv2c configuration is very similar, because both use communities. SNMPv3 varies quite a bit, mainly to implement the better SNMPv3 security features. This next section shows how to configure and verify SNMPv2c.\\nConfiguring SNMPv2c Support for Get and Set\\nSNMP configuration in Cisco IOS routers         and switches works a little differently than many other IOS features. First, the SNMP configuration exists in a series of global commands; there is no SNMP agent configuration mode in which to collect subcommands. Secondly, no single command enables the SNMP agent. Instead, IOS typically defaults for the SNMP \\nptg17396363700  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nagent to be disabled. Then, the first time an snmp-server global command is configured, \\nIOS enables the SNMP agent. \\nNOTE Because of this odd way to enable the SNMP agent, to disable the agent, you have to first remove all SNMP configuration with no commands, and then reload the router or switch. There is also no single command to disable the SNMP agent.\\nWith that backdrop, a typical SNMPv2c configuration requires only one or two settings. To be useful, the agent needs at least a read-only (RO) community string. The agent will not reply to SNMPv2c Get messages without at least the RO community string configured. The network engineer may also want the agent to have a read-write (RW) community string, to support Set messages. \\nNOTE When configuring an RW community, use some caution: configuring an RW com-munity means that you have defined a clear-text password that can be used to configure many settings on the router or switch.\\nThe following checklist details the commands used to configure SNMPv2c on a Cisco rout-er or switch. This list shows the method to configure         the RO and RW communities, plus a few optional but common settings (location and contact information).\\nStep 1. Use the snmp-server community communitystring RO [ipv6 acl-name] \\n[acl-name] command in global configuration mode to enable the SNMP \\nagent (if not already started), set the read-only community string, and restrict incoming SNMP messages based on the optional referenced IPv4 or IPv6 ACL.\\nStep 2. (Optional) Use the snmp-server community communitystring RW [ipv6 \\nacl-name] [acl-name] command in global configuration mode to enable the SNMP agent (if not already started), set the read-write community string, and restrict incoming SNMP messages based on the optional referenced IPv4 or IPv6 ACL.\\nStep 3. (Optional) If referenced by an snmp-server community command, configure \\nan IPv4 or IPv6 ACL, with the same name or number referenced by the snmp-server community command, with the ACL permitting by matching the \\nsource IPv4 or IPv6 address of the allowed SNMP management hosts.\\nStep 4. (Optional) Use the snmp-server location text-describing-location command in \\nglobal configuration mode to document the location of the device.\\nStep 5. (Optional) Use the snmp-server contact contact-name command in global con-\\nfiguration mode to document the person to contact if problems occur.\\nNOTE In the SNMP model, the SNMP agent acts as a server, with the NMS (SNMP \\nManager) acting as an SNMP client by requesting information with Get messages. The IOS snmp-server command   happens to emphasize the idea that the SNMP agent on a router or switch acts as the SNMP server. Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  701\\nExample 26-1 shows a sample configuration based on Figure 26-6. The examples in this sec-\\ntion come from Router R1, although the exact same SNMP configuration syntax could be used in the LAN switches or in R2. (The configuration of the location information would likely differ for each device, however.) Note that the configuration creates an IPv4 ACL that permits traffic with source IP address 10.1.3.3, which is the address of the NMS         shown in the figure. It then defines read-only and read-write communities, along with the location and contact name for the router.\\n10.1.3.3 NMS\\nG0/0 G0/1 G0/0 G0/1 SW1 SW2 SW3 R2 R1\\n10.1.3.4 NMS\\nFigure 26-6 Sample Network for SNMP Examples, with NMS at 10.1.3.3\\nExample 26-1 Configuring SNMP Version 2c on Router R1 to Support Get and Set\\nip access-list standard ACL_PROTECTSNMP\\n permit host 10.1.3.3\\n!\\nsnmp-server community secretROpw RO ACL_PROTECTSNMP\\nsnmp-server community secretRWpw RW ACL_PROTECTSNMPsnmp-server location Atlanta\\nsnmp-server contact Tyler B\\nTo begin managing Router R1 (or any of the other devices that use the same community \\nstrings), the SNMP manager at address 10.1.3.3 now needs         to configure the community strings listed in Example 26-1.\\nConfiguring SNMPv2c Support for Trap and Inform\\nFor an SNMPv2c agent         in a router or switch to be able to send unsolicited notifications to an SNMP manager (that is, to send Trap and Inform messages), the device needs to be con-figured with the   snmp-server host command. This command references the NMS to which \\nthe Traps or Informs should be sent, along with the SNMP version. \\nBeyond telling the SNMP agent the hostname or address of the NMS, the agent typically \\nneeds to know the   notification community string used by the NMS. Think of the RO and RW community strings as protecting the SNMP agent from the messages originated by an NMS (Get or Set Requests), so the agent requires the NMS to supply the correct RO or RW community string. For Traps and Informs, the NMS can protect itself from the Trap and Inform messages originated by SNMP agents by requiring those agents to include the notification community with those messages. The agent can configure this value on the snmp-server host command as well.\\nptg17396363702  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe following list details the command to enable the sending of SNMPv2c Trap or Inform \\nmessages to an NMS:\\nStep 1. Use the snmp-server host {hostname | ip-address} [informs] version 2c \\nnotification-community command in global configuration mode to configure \\nthe SNMP agent to send either SNMPv2c Traps (default) or Informs to the listed host. Use this command once for each host to which this device should send Traps. \\nStep 2. Use the snmp-server enable traps command in global configuration mode to \\nenable the sending of all supported types of Trap and Inform messages.\\nExample 26-2 shows a sample configuration. In most cases, you would send either Traps \\nor Informs to a particular NMS, but not both. So, for this example, the configuration shows how to configure to send Traps to one host (10.1.3.3), and Informs to another host (10.1.3.4). Note that this configuration is added to Router R1 from Figure 26-6, but         it could have been added to Router R2 or to any of the LAN switches as well.\\nExample 26-2 Configuring SNMP Version 2c on Router R1 to Support Sending Traps\\nsnmp-server host 10.1.3.3 version 2c secretTRAPpw\\nsnmp-server host 10.1.3.4 informs version 2c secretTRAPpw\\nsnmp-server enable traps\\nVerifying SNMPv2c Operation\\nExample 26-3 displays some    of the status information based on the configuration seen in \\nthe previous two examples. The variations on the show snmp command highlight several \\nconfiguration settings. For example, the show snmp community command repeats the com-munity string values, with reference to any attached IPv4 or IPv6 ACLs. The show snmp \\nhost command     lists the IP address or hostname of the NMS referenced by each snmp-server host configuration command.\\nExample 26-3 Confirming SNMPv2c Configuration Settings on Router R1\\nR1# show snmp community\\nCommunity name: secretROpw\\nCommunity Index: secretROpw\\nCommunity SecurityName: secretROpwstorage-type: nonvolatile active access-list: ACL_PROTECTSNMP\\nCommunity name: secretRWpw\\nCommunity Index: secretRWpwCommunity SecurityName: secretRWpw\\nstorage-type: nonvolatile active access-list: ACL_PROTECTSNMP\\nCommunity name: secretTRAPpw\\nCommunity Index: secretTRAPpwConfig\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  703\\nCommunity SecurityName: secretTRAPpw\\nstorage-type: nonvolatile active\\nR1# show snmp location\\nAtlanta\\nR1# show snmp contact  \\nTyler B\\nR1# show snmp host     \\nNotification host: 10.1.3.4     udp-port: 162   type: inform\\nuser: secretTRAPpw security model: v2c\\nNotification host: 10.1.3.3     udp-port: 162   type: trap\\nuser: secretTRAPpw security model: v2c\\nThe show snmp command      takes the opposite approach from the commands in Example \\n26-3, focusing almost completely on status and counter information, rather than repeating \\nconfiguration settings. This command lists dozens of lines of detailed information, so the sample in Example 26-4 shows just enough of the output to give you a sense of the kinds of information found there, with comments following the example.\\nExample 26-4 Finding SNMPv2c Message Load on Router R1\\nR1# show snmp\\nChassis: FTX162883H0\\nContact: Tyler B\\nLocation: Atlanta\\n7735 SNMP packets input    0 Bad SNMP version errors\\n    9 Unknown community name\\n    0 Illegal operation for community name supplied\\n    2 Encoding errors    51949 Number of requested variables\\n    2 Number of altered variables\\n    3740 Get-request PDUs\\n    3954 Get-next PDUs    7 Set-request PDUs\\n    0 Input queue packet drops (Maximum queue size 1000)\\n7850 SNMP packets output\\n    0 Too big errors (Maximum packet size 1500)    0 No such name errors\\n    0 Bad values errors\\n    0 General errors\\n    7263 Response PDUs    126 Trap PDUs\\n!

The highlighted items point out the number of SNMP packets received (input) and sent (output), as well as the number of requested MIB variables—that is, the number of variables requested in different SNMP Get requests. (Note that SNMP also supports the GetNext and GetBulk commands, so a single NMS user click can cause the NMS to Get many variables from an agent; thus, it is not unusual for the requested variables counter to get very large.) The output also shows that seven Set requests were received, resulting in two changes to variables. The fact that two Set requests changed variables is a good fact to know if you are wondering if someone has reconfigured something    on the device using SNMP.\\nImplementing SNMP Version 3\\nSNMPv3 configuration   on Cisco routers and switches has some commands in common with SNMPv2c configuration, and some completely different commands. The configuration to support sending Traps and Informs, using the snmp-server host and snmp-server enable traps commands, works almost identically, with a few small differences. However, SNMPv3 replaces all references to communities, and as a result does not use the snmp-server \\ncommunity command at all. Instead, it uses the snmp-server group and snmp-server user commands to configure the security features available to SNMPv3.\\nSNMPv3 has many more configuration options, and it is easy to get confused by the details. \\nSo, to get started, first look at a short SNMPv3 configuration example, as shown in Example 26-5. The example highlights the values you would have to choose, but the values are either text fields (names and passwords) or the IP address of the NMS. This configuration could be used to replace the SNMPv2c configuration and use username/password authentication. The    requirements met in the example are\\n■Use SNMPv3 authentication (basically replacing SNMPv2 communities).\\n■Use username Youdda and authentication password madeuppassword (in your network,\\nyou would choose your own values).\\n■Do not use SNMPv3 privacy (that is, message encryption).\\n■Allow both read (Get) and write (Set) access.\\n■Send Traps to an NMS (10.1.3.3), authenticating with the same username.\\nExample 26-5 Configuring SNMPv3 on R1—Authentication Only\\nR1(config)# snmp-server group BookGroup v3 auth write v1default\\nR1(config)# snmp-server user Youdda BookGroup v3 auth md5 madeuppassword\\nR1(config)# snmp-server host 10.1.3.3 version 3 auth Youdda\\nGiven the list of requirements, you could probably just read the configuration in Example \\n26-5, compare that to the list of requirements preceding the example, and correctly guess what most of the command parameters mean. However, we need to get into more detail to work through these commands and their options so that you understand the entire configu-ration, which is exactly what the next few pages do.\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  705\\nSNMPv3 Groups\\nSNMPv3 authentication     uses a username/password combination. When Cisco created its \\nSNMPv3 implementation in IOS, it realized that it might be useful to have groups of users that use some of the same security settings. So, rather than have each snmp-server user \\ncommand (the command that defines a user) define every single security parameter, Cisco put some of the security configuration settings into the   snmp-server group command. This command holds SNMPv3 security settings that are often the same between a group of SNMPv3 users; each snmp-server user command then refers to one SNMP group. This next topic explores those security parameters defined on the snmp-server group command.\\nFigure 26-7 shows the entire snmp-server group command. The   required parameters on the \\nleft include a name that the network engineer can make up; it only needs to match other commands on the local router. For SNMPv3 configuration, the v3 keyword would always be used. The text following this figure then details the rest of the parameters in the figure.\\nsnmp-server group write viewname access [ipv6] aclname name\\nYou Choose Optional:\\nRequired for SetAuth but\\nno PrivAuth\\nand PrivNeither Auth\\nnor Priv\\nOptional: Filter\\nSNMP Managersnoauth | auth | priv v3\\nFigure 26-7 SNMPv3 Groups—Configuration Command Parameters\\nThe next parameter in the command configures this group of users to use one of three \\nSNMPv3 security levels. As you can     see from the summary in Table 26-2, all three security \\nlevels provide message integrity for their messages, which confirms that the message has not been changed in transit. The auth option adds authentication to message integrity, using a username and password, with IOS storing the password with a hash and never sending the password as clear text. The last increase in security level, configured by using the priv secu-\\nrity level, causes the SNMP manager and agent to encrypt the entire SNMP packet for all SNMP     messages sent, in addition to performing message integrity and authentication.\\nTable 26-2 SNMPv3 Security Levels Keywords and Their Meanings\\nCommand \\nKeywordKeyword in MessagesChecks Message Integrity? Performs Authentication?Encrypts Messages?\\nnoauth noAuthNoPriv Y es No No\\nauth authNoPriv Y es Y es No\\npriv priv Y es Y es Y es\\nContinuing to look at the snmp-server group command in Figure 26-7, notice that it ends \\nwith an optional ACL to filter packets. This same idea is used in SNMPv2c to reference an IPv4 or IPv6 ACL to filter incoming messages coming from the SNMP manager. \\nSo far, the discussion has ignored one part of the snmp-server group command: the idea \\nof SNMPv3 MIB views. MIB views      define a subset of the MIB. IOS supplies a series of MIB views for us, and you can define your own MIB views if you like. However, this book \\nptg17396363706  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ndiscusses only one predefined MIB view that goes by the name  v1default, which is a MIB \\nview that includes all the useful parts of the MIB. Instead of focusing on the depths of how you might create different views of a router or switch MIB that has literally thousands of variables, focus on how the snmp-server group command uses that one MIB view that includes the majority of the MIB.\\nBy default, each SNMPv3 group, as defined with the snmp-server group command, has a \\nread MIB view of v1default, and no write view. As a result, the SNMP agent will process \\nreceived SNMPv3 Get requests, but not process received SNMPv3 Set requests. That com-plete lack of a write MIB view basically results in read-only behavior for the SNMP agent, as shown at the top of Figure 26-8.\\nRead View: V1Default Write View: (None)\\nXRead-Only (Default)\\nMIB\\nRead View: V1Default Write View: V1Default\\nRead/Write: Configure write v1defaultView: V1Default View: V1Default\\nFigure 26-8 SNMPv3 Views Creating Read-Only and Read-Write Effect\\nThe bottom of the figure shows the concept behind configuring an SNMP group with the write v1default parameters, causing the group to use the same write view of the MIB that is used for reading the MIB. By including write v1default in the snmp-server group com-mand, you migrate from a default operation of allowing only Gets to now also        allowing Sets. \\nTo pull these ideas together, Example 26-6 shows four similar SNMPv3 groups, which could \\nlater be referenced by snmp-server user commands. Two commands use the parameters write v1default, and two do not, so two groups create read-write (Get and Set) support, and two groups create read-only (Get only) support. Also, note that two groups refer to an IPv4 ACL by name (SNMPACL), and two do not. The ends of the lines in the example list com-ments about each command.\\nExample 26-6 SNMPv3 Groups—Comparisons with Write Views and ACL Security\\nip access-list standard SNMPACL\\n permit host 10.1.3.3\\n!\\nsnmp-server group Group1 v3 noauth !

Allows writes, \\nuses ACL\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  707\\nNote that while all four examples use an authentication type of noauth, groups could be \\ndefined that use the auth and priv types as well. Configuring groups with any one of the security levels does not change the meaning and use of the write and access keywords and \\ntheir parameters. The security level simply needs to match the security level configured     on the snmp-server user commands that refer to the group by name, as seen in the next section.\\nSNMPv3 Users, Passwords, and Encryption Keys\\nThe snmp-server user command   configures other security parameters for the SNMP agent. \\nIn particular, it configures\\n■The username\\n■The authentication password and the authentication hash algorithm (MD5 or SHA)\\n■The encryption key and the encryption algorithm (DES, 3DES, AES)\\n■A reference to an snmp-server group command by name, which holds more security\\nconfiguration\\nThe snmp-server user command still has plenty of moving parts, even with some of the \\nsecurity configuration sitting in the snmp-server group command. Figure 26-9 connects these configuration concepts together, showing both commands in one place. Some expla-nation follows the figure.\\nsnmp-server group write viewname access [ipv6] aclname\\nusergroup v3\\nMatchnoauth | auth | priv\\nsnmp-server user md5 password DES keyvalue\\nsha password 3DES keyvalue\\nAES keylength  keyvaluepriv group v3 authOnly Both\\nFigure 26-9 SNMPv3 Users and Groups: Configured\\nThe snmp-server user command    creates the username itself. The network engineer can \\nmake up a name. The next two parameters must match the chosen snmp-server group com-\\nmand associated with this user, by matching the group name and the v3 keyword (meaning SNMPv3). Any mistakes here will result in this SNMP user not being associated with the SNMP group. \\nYou must pay particular attention to the security type in the associated snmp-server group \\ncommand, because it dictates what parameters must be configured toward the end of the \\nsnmp-server user command. As noted in Figure 26-9 with the arrowed lines, the use of the auth keyword in the snmp-server group command requires that you configure             authenti-cation parameters for the user in the snmp-server user command: the password and the choice of authentication hash algorithms. If using the priv keyword in the snmp-server group command, the snmp-server user command must define both authentication and pri-vacy parameters as shown in the figure.\\nptg17396363708  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE IOS allows you to misconfigure the snmp-server user command so that it omits \\nthe auth or priv keyword, even when the referenced snmp-server group command uses the \\nauth or priv parameter. However, that misconfiguration causes the SNMP agent to not be able to communicate with the SNMP manager. For instance, if the snmp-server user com-\\nmand omits the auth keyword and associated parameters, but the snmp-server group com-mand uses the auth keyword, IOS accepts the configuration commands, but authentication fails when the agent and NMS try to communicate.\\nExample 26-7 shows a series of snmp-server group and matching snmp-server user commands, one after the other, so you can more easily see the parameters. Note that the snmp-server group commands do not include the optional parameters to enable writes (write v1default) or to use an ACL, just to reduce clutter. \\nExample 26-7 SNMPv3 Configuration Samples: Groups and Users\\n!

You can of course find these with the show running-config command, but two com-mands in particular repeat the configuration settings. Example 26-8 shows the output from one of those commands, show snmp user, taken   from Router R1 after adding the configu-ration listed in Example 26-7.\\nExample 26-8 Verifying SNMPv3 Configuration Settings\\nR3# show snmp user\\nUser name: Youdda1\\nEngine ID: 800000090300D48CB57D8200\\nstorage-type: nonvolatile        active\\nAuthentication Protocol: NonePrivacy Protocol: None\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  709\\nGroup-name: BookGroup1\\nUser name: Youdda2\\nEngine ID: 800000090300D48CB57D8200\\nstorage-type: nonvolatile activeAuthentication Protocol: MD5\\nPrivacy Protocol: None\\nGroup-name: BookGroup2\\n!

All the highlighted entries basically repeat the settings from the configuration.\\nExample 26-9 lists output from the show snmp group command, which also confirms con-\\nfiguration settings from Example 26-7. The most challenging thing to find in this output is what is missing, rather than what is there. Note that this command does not list the SNMP usernames that happen to refer to this group. Also, for groups that do not use an ACL, there is no obvious text that states that no ACL is used. Make sure to compare the output for BookGroup1, which      uses an ACL, and the output for BookGroup2, which does not use an ACL.\\nExample 26-9 Verifying SNMPv3 Using show snmp group\\nR3# show snmp group \\ngroupname: BookGroup1 security model:v3 noauth \\ncontextname: <no context specified> storage-type: nonvolatile\\nreadview : v1default writeview: v1default  \\nnotifyview: <no notifyview specified>row status: active access-list: ACL_PROTECTSNMP\\ngroupname: BookGroup2 security model:v3 auth \\ncontextname: <no context specified> storage-type: nonvolatile\\nreadview : v1default writeview: <no writeview specified> \\nnotifyview: <no notifyview specified>\\nrow status: active\\n!

SNMPv2c uses communities, in this case using the SNMPv2c notification community concept. SNMPv3 uses          the same security levels just discussed, but as applied to SNMPv3 notifications. \\nTo configure an SNMPv3 agent to send notifications, you add the security level and the \\nusername to the snmp-server host command. That configuration links to the same kinds of snmp-server user commands   discussed earlier in this section, which in turn link to an snmp-server group command. Figure 26-10 shows how the commands connect to each other.\\nsnmp-server group write viewname access [ipv6] aclname\\nusername\\naddressgroupname  v3\\ngroupname  v3noauth | auth | priv\\nsnmp-server host username version 3 noauth | auth | privsnmp-server user md5 password DES keyvalue\\nsha password 3DES keyvalue\\nAES {128|192|256} keyvaluepriv auth\\n12 3\\nFigure 26-10 Connecting SNMPv3 Notification Configuration with User and Group\\nNOTE IOS allows you to configure commands that refer to the correct username and \\ngroup name, but with different security levels, with no error messages. However, communi-cation with the NMS then fails.\\nExample 26-10 shows a few samples of configuration notifications that use SNMPv3. The samples rely on the SNMPv3 usernames and groups as defined in Example 26-7. Feel free to refer back to that example, and check to make sure that each snmp-server host command in \\nExample 26-10 refers to the correct SNMP security level used by          each linked snmp-server group command.\\nExample 26-10 Verifying SNMPv3 Configuration Settings\\n!

As a \\nresult, putting the commands into a configuration checklist earlier in this section did not work as well for learning, so the text instead spelled out the pieces little by little. Now that you have seen how to configure the individual pieces, this configuration checklist summa-rizes all the different SNMPv3 configuration options discussed in this chapter, for easier review.\\nStep 1. Use the snmp-server group groupname v3 {noauth | auth | priv} [write \\nv1default] [access [ipv6] acl-name] command in global configuration mode to \\nenable the SNMP agent (if not already started), create a named SNMPv3 group \\nof security settings, set the security level, optionally override the default write view with the same view as defaulted for use as the read MIB view (v1default), and optionally restrict incoming SNMP messages based on the optional referenced IPv4 or IPv6 ACL.\\nStep 2. To configure users whose referenced SNMPv3 group has a security level of noauth, use the snmp-server user username groupname v3 command in \\nglobal configuration mode, making sure to reference an SNMPv3 group with security level of noauth configured. \\nStep 3. To configure users whose referenced SNMPv3 group use the security level of auth: \\nA. Use the snmp-server user username groupname v3 auth md5 pass-\\nword command in global configuration mode to configure the user and \\nauthentication password, and to choose to use MD5 as the authentica-tion hash algorithm.\\nB. Alternatively, use the snmp-server user username groupname v3 auth \\nsha password command in global configuration mode to configure \\nthe user and authentication password, and to choose to use SHA as the authentication hash algorithm.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg17396363712  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStep 4. To configure users that use the security level of priv, you will add parameters \\nto the end of the snmp-server user command syntax as configured in Step 3, \\nas follows: \\nA. Add the priv des encryption-key parameters in global configuration \\nmode to the end of the snmp-server user command, to enable the use of DES as the encryption algorithm and to set the encryption key.\\nB. Add the priv 3des encryption-key parameters in global configuration \\nmode to the end of the snmp-server user command, to enable the use of triple DES (3DES) as the encryption algorithm and to set the encryp-tion key.\\nC. Add the priv aes {128 | 192 | 256} encryption-key parameters in global \\nconfiguration mode to the end of the snmp-server user command, to enable the use of AES as the encryption algorithm, to set the length of the encryption key in bits, and to set the seed for the encryption key.\\nStep 5. Enable the SNMP agent to send notification messages (Traps and/or Informs) to an NMS as follows:\\nA. Use the snmp-server host {hostname | ip-address} [informs | traps] \\nversion 3 {noauth | auth | priv} username command in global \\nconfiguration mode to configure the SNMP agent to send SNMPv3 Traps to the listed host, using the listed username. Use this command once for each host to which this device should send Traps. Include the informs keyword to send Informs; the traps keyword is the default setting. Use the same security level setting as the link SNMPv3 group.\\nB. Use the snmp-server enable traps command in global configuration \\nmode to enable the sending of all supported   notifications to all hosts defined in snmp-server host commands. \\nNote that if you review this checklist and get lost, make sure to review and study this sec-\\ntion again. SNMPv3 configuration uses a lot of different parameters on three different com-mands, so it is easy to get lost. The checklist is best used for review once you have a good understanding of the commands.\\nIP Service Level Agreement\\nA service level agreement (SLA) is a   contract or agreement between two parties, with one \\nsupplying some service to the second party. The document defines the level of service; with IT, the definition could be for a percentage of the time a service is available, or the round-trip response time of an application, and so on. For instance, a service provider might agree to an SLA that defines the availability numbers for a WAN service to each enterprise site. The enterprise IT department then might agree to an SLA with its internal customers in dif-ferent business units for application availability and performance.\\nThe IP Service Level Agreement (IPA SLA) feature   of Cisco routers provides a means to \\nmeasure and display several key performance and availability indicators. These IP SLA sta-tistics can be used as measurements to determine if an SLA has been met over some period of time. Additionally, IP SLA features can be used for many other purposes as well, like bet-ter network monitoring and troubleshooting. \\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  713\\nThis next section takes a short look at IP SLA, but from a little different perspective than \\nmany other topics in this book. While this section does show some IP SLA configura-tion, the goal here is to show how to use IP SLA for troubleshooting, rather than to work through all the details of configuration. Think of it as if you need to operate the network, and another more experienced engineer may have set up some IP SLA configurations in different places in the network. Your job: use the information available from IP SLA to troubleshoot a network. \\nAn Overview of IP SLA\\nNetwork engineers could measure network performance and availability for SLAs by mea-suring actual end-user traffic. However, measuring    end-user traffic could require placing some kind of software on the user devices themselves, with those hidden applications then measuring key facts such as application response time, QoS metrics like jitter and loss, or simple availability information, like whether the host can ping a particular other host. \\nIP SLA gives network   engineers a much different option that does not bother end-user \\ndevices. IP SLA runs on a router and generates traffic that mimics user traffic, but without placing any software on the end-user devices. IP SLA—a router-specific feature not found on Cisco switches—can be configured to perform over a dozen different types of IP SLA operations. These operations can be as simple as the equivalent of issuing a ping command (to send an ICMP Echo message), to sending messages whose headers mimic voice traffic so that VoIP delay, jitter, and loss can be measured with packets that receive the same QoS treatment as end-user voice traffic. \\nIP SLA operations generate this traffic, receive   responses, measure the results, and then \\nmake that information available.\\nTo see how IP SLA works at least in some cases, Figure 26-11 shows a simple design with a \\ncouple of routers. The two routers sit at different sites. The senior network engineer wants to track voice delay and jitter over the WAN in preparation for an upcoming revision to an end-user SLA. The engineer could use one of several IP SLA operations—for instance, the RTP-based VoIP operation, called a UDP Jitter probe, which    generates IP packets that include a UDP and RTP header like normal VoIP traffic. \\nUDP VoIP ProbeSLA\\nSourceSLA\\nResponder\\nResponseR1 R41\\n2\\nFigure 26-11 Using ICMP UDP Jitter Probes\\nMany of the IP SLA probes rely on one router to generate the packets   (the IP SLA source), \\nwith another router replying back    (the IP SLA responder), as shown in Figure 26-11. However, some IP SLA operations do not require an IP SLA responder, like the ICMP Echo probe. This operation generates an ICMP Echo Request message, so any host that will respond to a normal ICMP Echo Request (a normal ping) will reply back with an ICMP Echo Reply. Using the    IP SLA ICMP Echo probe means that you can monitor the state of and performance sending packets to any IP address in the network, including servers and user hosts, as shown in Figure 26-12. Steps 1 and 2 show Router R1 as an IP SLA source, \\nptg17396363714  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nwith R4 replying to the normal ICMP packet. Steps 3 and 4 show the same idea, again with \\nRouter R1 as the IP SLA source, with the server replying to the ICMP Echo message.\\nICMP Echo Request\\nICMP Echo Response\\nICMP Echo Request\\nICMP Echo ResponseR1 R41\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nFigure 26-12 Using IP SLA ICMP Echo Probes to Routers and Normal Hosts\\nNOTE The term IP SLA probe is  commonly used instead of the more formal term IP SLA operation. \\nBasic IP SLA ICMP-Echo Configuration\\nThis section shows a couple of IP SLA ICMP-Echo operations     configured on a router, just to give you a sense for what can be configured. In this scenario, the senior engineer decided to configure R1, the central site router in a network, as the IP SLA source. He configured an ICMP Echo probe, with the branch office router’s LAN IP address (10.1.3.2) as the destina-tion. He also used the central site router’s LAN IP address (10.1.1.1) as the source. By using these addresses, the probe not only tests WAN connectivity, but tests the two routers’ IP routing tables for the LAN subnet destinations. \\nFigure 26-13 shows a small subset of the network, with central site R1 on the left, and a \\nsample branch office R2 on the right.\\nR1 R2G0/0 S0/0/1 S0/1/1 G0/1\\n10.1.1.110.1.4.2 10.1.4.110.1.3.2\\nFigure 26-13 Sample Network with IP SLA ICMP Echo Probes\\nExample 26-12 shows an example IP SLA operation that the senior engineer is considering using. It refers to R2’s LAN subnet address of 10.1.3.2 as the destination of the ICMP Echo, and uses R1’s LAN IP address of 10.1.1.1 as the source IP address. In fact, of all the com-mands shown in the example, only the highlighted commands would be required to create the operations; the rest of the commands set related parameters. \\nExample 26-12 IP SLA Configuration Used in This Section\\nip sla 1\\n  icmp-echo 10.1.3.2 source-ip 10.1.1.1 !

IP SLA uses \\na concept of configuring the IP SLA operation with a number, with many subcommands defining the probe, as seen in the majority of the example. Separately, as shown at the bot-tom of the example, the ip sla schedule global configuration command tells IOS when to run the operation: when to start, and when to stop. An operation can be started at a certain date and time, or in so much time from when the command is issued, or to just start now (as is shown in the example with the start-time now parameters). This command can also limit how long the probe runs; in this case, the probe runs forever, which means until the engineer       issues a command like no ip sla schedule 1 to remove the command from the con-\\nfiguration. \\nTroubleshooting Using IP SLA Counters\\nThe IP SLA ICMP-Echo operation does the equivalent of a single ping to another address, on a timed basis. So how does that help you troubleshoot problems, particularly in com-parison to just using the ping command from the CLI? This section shows how, by taking a closer look at the data made available by IP SLA.\\nTo begin, take a look at the     most basic IP SLA show command, the show ip sla summary \\ncommand, as listed in Example 26-13. The command lists a single line of output per SLA operation. It lists some configuration information, namely the address to which the ICMP Echo is being sent. It also lists the two key pieces of information you have seen many times in the output of ping commands: an indication of whether the Echo Request received a response, and the   Round Trip Time (RTT), which measures the delay from sending the ICMP Echo Request until receiving the matching ICMP Echo Reply. With this command, the success or failure is shown in the Return Code column, with OK meaning that an Echo Reply was received.\\nExample 26-13 Displaying the Return Code State and RTT with Basic IP SLA \\nCommands\\nR1# show ip sla summary \\nIPSLAs Latest Operation Summary\\nCodes: * active, ^ inactive, ~ pending\\nID Type        Destination       Stats Return Last\\n(ms) Code Run \\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n*1 icmp-echo   10.1.3.2 RTT=124     OK 15 seconds ago             \\n*2 icmp-echo   10.1.3.2 RTT=184     OK 11 seconds ago\\nR1# ping 10.1.3.2\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.1.3.2, timeout is 2 seconds:\\n!!!!!\\nSuccess rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/1/4 ms\\nR1#\\nptg17396363716  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNote that Example 26-13 shows the output of a ping command for comparison. That com-\\nmand lists the same basic information—success (or not) for the (default) five Echo Requests, and some stats about the RTT for those Echo Request/Response pairs.\\nAn IP SLA ICMP-Echo operation can measure two facts: success/failure of the Echo, and \\nthe RTT. To use that information for better troubleshooting, beyond just issuing a ping \\ncommand, you need to go beyond the status of the most recent IP SLA operation, and look at statistics about the history of previous IP SLA operations.\\nThe show ip sla statistics 1 command provides some basic history through a counter of \\nsuccesses and failures, as shown in Example 26-14. In addition to the return code and RTT \\nof the most recent operation, you get a counter of successes       and failures of past operations. So, you can get a sense of whether the pings have been failing or not. \\nExample 26-14 Historical Success/Failure Counters with IP SLA\\nR1# show ip sla statistics 1\\nIPSLAs Latest Operation Statistics\\nIPSLA operation id: 1\\nLatest RTT: 16 milliseconds\\nLatest operation start time: 12:40:39 EST Tue Jan 5 2016\\nLatest operation return code: OK\\nNumber of successes: 7\\nNumber of failures: 0Operation time to live: Forever\\nThink about a couple of troubleshooting scenarios with these stats. Imagine the stats show \\n22 successes, but 15 failures. You ping the address (with the same source address as well, using extended ping), and it works correctly now. But the statistics show that almost half of the most recent operations failed. Without that history, you might use the ping, see it work, and think that no problems existed at all. Conversely, if you see counters with only a few failures, and the ping fails right now, that could tell you that some problem exists, and it just happened, so that might give you some direction as well. \\nSeeing the counters with the numbers of successes and failures brings up a key question: \\nHow often does IP SLA perform an operation? As you probably would guess, that setting is configurable. The samples in Example 26-12 both set the operation frequency to 60 (sec-onds), which is the default for ICMP-Echo operations. \\nYou may also want to reset those statistics when troubleshooting. For instance, imagine that \\nyou show up to do some troubleshooting on a router that acts as an IP SLA source. If the counters show 80 successes and 5 failures, with a 60-second frequency, you may find that information helpful, but maybe not. Those five failures could be spread across those 85 minutes, could have all happened over an hour ago, and so on. So, you might just want    to reset the counters, and then check again a little later in the troubleshooting process. To do so, issue the ip sla restart op-number command in global configuration mode.  \\nTroubleshooting Using IP SLA History\\nIP SLA has two other methods to keep historical data and even perform analysis on that data. IOS first had IP SLA history. Later, Cisco added new history features, referring to \\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  717\\nthose as  enhanced history. Both take the RTT concept, save the information, and in the \\ncase of enhanced history, aggregate the information to conserve memory, while keeping \\nmore details. This     next topic shows an example using traditional IP SLA history.\\nTraditional IP SLA history data can be enabled and then displayed with the   show ip sla \\nhistory command, as shown in Example 26-15. (IP SLA operation 1 from Example 26-12 \\nuses history; note that operation 2, with the   history enhanced IP SLA subcommand, also enables enhanced history.) \\nWith traditional IP SLA history, SLA takes the RTT and return code information and stores it \\nin a history bucket. The show ip sla history command then displays one line per bucket. You can think of it as the same information in the show ip sla summary command seen back in Example 26-13, but going backward in time for the number of history buckets defined. Earlier Example 26-12 shows IP SLA operation 1 uses six buckets, so the output in Example 26-15 shows the results of the most recent six IP SLA operations for operation number 1.\\nExample 26-15 Displaying the Traditional Historical State of an IP SLA ICMP Echo \\nProbe\\nR1# show ip sla history 1\\nPoint by point History\\nEntry    = Entry number\\nLifeI    = Life index\\nBucketI  = Bucket indexSampleI  = Sample index\\nSampleT  = Sample start time (milliseconds)\\nCompT    = RTT (milliseconds)\\nSense    = Response return code\\nEntry LifeI BucketI    SampleI    SampleT    CompT Sense TargetAddr\\n1     1 11 1 59438868   108 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 12 1 59498868   188 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 13 1 59558868   280 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 14 1 59618868   88 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 15 1 59678868   160 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 16 1 59738868   252 1 10.1.3.2\\nFirst, look at the legend information in the top half of Example 26-15, and the two highlighted \\nlines in particular. Those show an odd quirk, with the two most useful fields for troubleshoot-ing using different headings than the earlier commands: CompT and Sense. Sense refers to \\nthe same idea as return code in the commands in Examples 26-13 and 26-14, with a numeric 1 meaning that the probe succeeded. A return code of timeout and a sense of 4 means that the ICMP Echo probe did not receive a response to the ICMP Echo Request. \\nYou can troubleshoot a little more easily with this historical data by looking for a few key \\ntrends. First, imagine that the probe configured 30 buckets and the frequency was 60 sec-onds, so that the operation keeps 30 minutes of historical data. You can look for spikes in the RTT (in the CompT column). You can also look to see if the return code (in the Sense column) had been working consistently, or if the Echo Requests had been failing off and on for a while. Those answers might lead you more toward issues of network performance or QoS, or more toward     specific connectivity issues.\\nptg17396363718  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSPAN\\nThis next major section of the chapter moves from the router-specific tool of IP SLA to \\na switch-specific tool: Switched Port Analyzer, or SPAN. SPAN enables switches to make copies of some of the Ethernet   frames flowing through the switch, sending them out a specific port. Many networking tools can make use of the copies of these frames, from intrusion prevention systems (IPS), to offloading some workloads away from servers, and sending the frames to network analysis tools to help troubleshoot a problem. \\nThis section introduces the concepts behind SPAN, along with how to configure Local \\nSPAN on a Cisco switch. The discussion revolves around how to use SPAN to mirror traffic to a network analyzer, for the purpose of then troubleshooting problems.\\nSPAN Concepts\\nNetwork analyzers capture and analyze the   contents of frames and enter and exit a net-work interface card (NIC)   on the host where the analyzer is running. The analyzer may be a purpose-built hardware appliance, capturing the frames entering and exiting the appli-ance. Often, the analyzer is a software application installed on a PC or server, or as a virtual machine (VM) in a data center.\\nFor example, a network engineer can install a network analyzer on a PC and start using it, \\ncapturing all Ethernet frames sent in and out the Ethernet NIC, or all 802.11 frames sent in/out the wireless NIC. (In fact, if you have never done so, take a few minutes to do a lab: download the free   Wireshark network analyzer from https://www.wireshark.org, start it, and capture all the frames entering and exiting your own PC.) The network analyzer can then display the contents of each frame in hex and binary, but more importantly, it will separate out each message, each header in each message, and make it much easier to sift through the data to troubleshoot a problem. Figure 26-14 shows a copy of a screen from the Wireshark analyzer, taken when building an upcoming example in which a host pinged another host, with the output listing the details of one of the packets carrying the ICMP Echo Request.\\nFigure 26-14 Screenshot of Wireshark Network Analyzer User Interface\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  719\\nThe Need for SPAN When Using a Network Analyzer\\nAlthough you can install     network analyzer software on your own PC, to be ready to trou-\\nbleshoot problems in a network, network engineers place network analyzers around the network, connecting to one of the LAN switches in the network. However, the network analyzer needs to receive copies of the frames into its NIC so that the analyzer can capture and then analyze the frames. Because of the normal operation of a LAN switch, the network analyzer will not receive copies of frames unless the switch is configured to send copies of frames out another port, which is exactly what SPAN does.\\nTo see an example of both the problem and the solution, Figures 26-15 and 26-16 show a \\nbefore-and-after flow, before SPAN and after SPAN. In this case, the arrow line represents Ethernet frames being sent between a PC and a server. Without SPAN, after the first frame is sent by each device, the LAN switch will have learned the MAC addresses used by each device. Any frames sent from the PC to the server, and back, will be forwarded as unicast frames out ports G1/0/11 or G1/0/12. None of the frames addressed to the PC or server will be forwarded to the network analyzer. \\nLayer 2 Switch\\nUnicast Frames\\nNetwork\\nAnalyzerG 1/0/11\\nG 1/0/21G 1/0/12\\nFigure 26-15 Layer 2 Forwarding Logic: Network Analyzer Does Not Receive Frames\\nNOTE The examples in this section were taken from a Cisco 2960-XR switch, which uses a \\nthree-digit interface ID.\\nSPAN solves this problem by copying those frames from certain ports (SPAN source ports) to the port where the network analyzer sits (the SPAN destination port). Figure 26-16 shows the concept. In this case, the switch has two SPAN source ports, G1/0/11 and G1/0/12. Frames             received on both ports are copied out to the SPAN destination port G1/0/21. \\nptg17396363720  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nLayer 2 Switch\\nUnicast Frames\\nNetwork\\nAnalyzerG 1/0/11\\nG 1/0/21G 1/0/12Unicast Frames\\nSPAN SPAN \\nFigure 26-16 SPAN Copies (Mirrors) Frames to the Network Analyzer\\nSPAN Session Concepts\\nA collection of SPAN rules, called a SPAN session, can    define one or more source ports, as \\nwell as define the direction of traffic on each port that should be then copied to the desti-nation port. Some examples help make more sense of the concepts. \\nFirst, consider the SPAN example in Figure 26-17. It shows the concept of using port \\nG1/0/11 as a source port. However, the logic goes beyond identifying the source port; it also specifies for the switch to copy frames being transmitted (Tx) out that switch port. The SPAN logic would watch for frames sent out that switch port, and then copy the frames out the SPAN destination port (G1/0/21 in this case).\\nSPAN Source Port\\nG 1/0/12Tx\\nG 1/0/11SPAN Transmit G 1/0/11\\nCopied...\\nNetwork\\nAnalyzerG 1/0/21\\nFigure 26-17 SPAN Construct: Source Port G1/0/11, for Frames in the Transmit \\nDirection\\nFigure 26-18 shows the contrasting concepts behind using the receive direction. The exam-\\nple shown in Figure 26-18 is just like that shown in Figure 26-17, except the SPAN function monitors traffic received (Rx) on that same interface. In this case, frames    received on the switch interface would be sent out to the SPAN destination port.\\nSPAN Source Port\\nG 1/0/12 G 1/0/11RxSPAN Receive  G 1/0/11\\nCopied...\\nNetwork\\nAnalyzerG 1/0/21\\nFigure 26-18 SPAN Construct: Source Port G1/0/11, for Frames in the Receive Direction\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  721\\nOne SPAN session can be configured to monitor one or more ports and, on each port, to \\nmonitor for frames transmitted out the switch port, monitor for frames received in the switch port, or monitor in both directions.\\nSPAN also supports    monitoring VLANs. However, the idea of monitoring the receive, \\ntransmit, and both directions for a VLAN does not apply to the VLAN as a whole. Instead, using SPAN on a VLAN means using SPAN on all ports in the VLAN (including trunks). For instance, if a switch has eight access ports in VLAN 3, a SPAN session that monitors VLAN 3 for received traffic monitors all eight ports in that VLAN for each port’s received traf-fic. Later, if ports are added or removed from VLAN 3, the SPAN logic will adjust without requiring reconfiguration.\\nFinally, all the example topologies so far happen to show Local SPAN: instances in which \\nthe SPAN source ports and the SPAN destination port are attached to the same switch. In some cases, you might need to send the SPAN traffic to a device attached to another switch.\\nCisco switches supply two solutions to use SPAN with remote destinations, each use-\\nful depending on the network topology between the switches. Remote SPAN (RSPAN), as seen         at the top of Figure 26-19, forwards the SPAN traffic over a VLAN at Layer 2. Encapsulated RSPAN (ERSPAN) expects Layer 3 switches and a Layer 3 forwarding path between the switches, so it encapsulates the SPAN traffic in a GRE tunnel to forward the traffic    to another switch.\\nDestination TrunkRemote SPAN (RSPAN)\\nEncapsulated RSPAN (ERSPAN)Layer 2\\nSource\\nSPAN SPAN SW1 SW2Layer 2\\nDestination Layer 3\\nGRELayer 3\\nSource\\nSPAN SPAN SW3 SW4Layer 3\\nFigure 26-19 RSPAN and ERSPAN Defined\\nConfiguring Local SPAN\\nLocal SPAN enables network engineers     to troubleshoot problems by using tools like network analyzers. The goal of the configuration then is to define the correct sources of information (ports and/or VLANs, and transmit/receive directions), and identify the correct destination port where the analyzer sits.\\nIOS uses a series of monitor session global commands to configure SPAN. SPAN allows the \\ndefinition of multiple monitor sessions. Each   monitor session defines one or more SPAN sources of the same type (either port or VLAN, but not a mix), plus a single SPAN destina-tion port. \\nptg17396363722  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSPAN configuration actually has quite a few dependencies, with the following list mention-\\ning some of the most important dependencies:\\n■A SPAN destination    port can be used with only one SPAN session at a time.\\n■A SPAN destination port cannot also be a SPAN source port.\\n■When configured as a SPAN destination port, the switch no longer treats the port as a\\nnormal port. That is, the switch does not learn MAC addresses for received frames, or\\nsend frames based on matching the MAC table, for that port.\\n■A SPAN destination port can be unconfigured from one monitor session (no monitor\\nsession number destination interface type number) and then added to another monitor\\nsession.\\n■Multiple SPAN sources can be used in a single SPAN session.\\n■One SPAN session cannot mix interfaces and VLAN sources; that is, the sources must all\\nbe interfaces or all be VLANs.\\n■One SPAN session can use any combination of directions (transmit, receive, and both) as\\napplied to different SPAN sources.\\n■EtherChannel interfaces can be used as source ports. Frames for all ports in the\\nEtherChannel will be considered by SPAN.\\n■Trunks can be used as source ports. When used, by default, SPAN includes frames from\\nall VLANs on that trunk, but SPAN VLAN    filtering can limit the VLANs included.\\nThe following list details the commands used to configure Local SPAN on a Cisco switch, \\ncollected into a checklist for easier review and study. Note that to configure the source port (interface), the command can refer to a single interface, or to     the first and last interface numbers in a range. However, the command does not use a range keyword. (Explanations and examples follow the checklist.)\\nStep 1. Use the monitor session number source interface type number\\n[- last-in-range] [rx | tx | both] command in global configuration mode to iden-\\ntify a SPAN session by number, and define one SPAN source interface. Repeat this command to define all SPAN source ports for this session.\\nStep 2. Use the monitor session number source vlan vlan-id [rx | tx | both] com-\\nmand in global configuration mode to identify a SPAN session by number, and define one SPAN source VLAN. Repeat this command to define all SPAN source VLANs for this session.\\nStep 3. Use the monitor session number destination interface type number global \\ncommand to define the one SPAN destination port for the monitor session.\\nFor example, Figure 26-20 shows the ideas behind the configuration of two monitor ses-\\nsions in Example 26-16, numbered 1 and 2. SPAN session 1 uses two source ports, monitor-ing frames received on those ports. (Session 1 matches the earlier example shown in Figure 26-16.) SPAN session 2 shows the ideas of monitoring VLAN 11, for frames going in both directions on each port in VLAN 11, and sending copies of those frames out destination     port G1/0/22. Example 26-16 shows the configuration that matches the figure.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  723\\nG1/0/11Sources\\nDifferent\\nDestination\\nPortsMonitor Session 1\\nRxTx Both\\nG1/0/12 Rx Tx Both\\nDestination Port G1/0/21VLAN 11SourcesMonitor Session 2\\nRx Tx Both\\nDestination Port G1/0/22\\nFigure 26-20 SPAN Monitor Sessions—Some Dependencies\\nExample 26-16 Configuring SPAN Monitor Sessions 1 and 2\\n!

The details of how to use the output of the analyzer go beyond the scope of this book. However, when using the analyzer, if the capture does not appear to be working in that no frames are being captured, you can check the SPAN ses-sions with the   show monitor session all command, as listed in Example 26-17. This com-\\nmand lists the configuration of each monitor session, including any default settings not listed in the configuration     commands. \\nExample 26-17 Configuring a SPAN Monitor Session 1 Per Figure 26-18\\nSW11# show monitor session all\\nSession 1\\n---------\\nType : Local Session\\nSource Ports : \\n    RX Only : Gi1/0/11-12\\nDestination Ports : Gi1/0/21    Encapsulation : Native\\nIngress : Disabled\\nSession 2\\n---------\\nType : Local Session\\nSource VLANs :\\n    Both : 11\\nDestination Ports : Gi1/0/22\\nptg17396363724  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n    Encapsulation : Native\\nIngress : Disabled\\nSW11# show monitor detail\\nSession 1\\n---------\\nType : Local Session\\nDescription : -\\nSource Ports : \\n    RX Only : Gi1/0/11-12\\n    TX Only : None\\n    Both : None\\nSource VLANs :\\n    RX Only : None\\n    TX Only : None\\n    Both : None\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nPay particular attention to the details around the SPAN sources in the show monitor \\nsession command, as compared with the     show monitor detail command at the end of the example. The show monitor session output lists the source port or VLAN, but breaks down the information based on ports/VLANs configured for receive frames, transmit     frames, or both, listing no lines for directions that do not happen to be configured for that SPAN session. The show monitor detail command (shown here for session 1 only) lists all three directions, for both ports and VLANs, so you can clearly see each port/VLAN and associated direction.\\nSPAN Session Parameters for Troubleshooting\\nTo close this section and chapter, stop and think for a moment about what SPAN does. Think about interface speeds, and the work that must be done on the network analyzer con-nected to the SPAN destination port. And think about this question: How much SPAN is too much?\\nFor example, consider a SPAN session that collects traffic in the receive direction for ten \\nFastEthernet ports. If the destination port is also a FastEthernet port, it is easy to imagine that more than 100 Mbps of traffic needs to be sent out to the destination port, because at full speeds, those ten ports at 100 Mbps could generate 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) of traffic.\\nNow think about that same case, but with the simple change to monitor for both directions of \\npackets. That just doubled the potential amount of traffic sent out to the destination port. \\nFinally, think about the host where the network analyzer runs. It might be a purpose-built \\nnetwork analyzer appliance so that it can handle the load. Sometimes, it’s the 7-year-old laptop that no one uses any more, except to connect to a switch to capture packets. That laptop might not handle the amount of traffic sent by SPAN.\\nAll these scenarios result in the same kinds of problems. The network analyzer does not \\ncapture what you need to capture, you cannot troubleshoot the problem, and you have to waste time repeating the effort to get a good capture of what is happening in the network.\\nptg1739636326Chapter 26: Network Management  725\\nChoosing to Limit SPAN Sources\\nGood engineers do not just decide       to use SPAN on the entire VLAN in both directions \\nwithout giving any thought to what they really need to capture. Instead, engineers think about what needs to be captured, how to get SPAN to capture that traffic, and capture as \\nlittle other traffic as possible.\\nFor example, if the goal of a capture is to see traffic sent by the switch to all hosts in a \\nVLAN, then create a SPAN session with that VLAN as the source, for the transmit direc-tion. However, if you only really care about 3 of the 12 access ports in that VLAN, take the time to configure the SPAN session just for those ports.\\nIt is also easy to make poor choices regarding the traffic direction—choices that work, but \\nthat overload the SPAN      destination port. For instance, Figure 26-21 represents the SPAN logic applied to the four ports in the same VLAN (11), with a command like monitor \\nsession 1 source VLAN 11 both. Each Tx and Rx bubble represents a location where SPAN \\nis monitoring either transmit or receive traffic. The figure then focuses on one Ethernet frame, sent by PC1 to PC3. \\n1 3\\n2 4Tx\\nRx\\nTx\\nRxRx\\nTx\\nRx12\\nTxLayer 2 Switch\\nFigure 26-21 Frame from PC1 to PC3—SPAN Copies Twice\\nEnabling SPAN in this VLAN, for both directions, means that SPAN monitors both transmit and receive traffic on each port in that VLAN. The single frame shown in the figure would be seen by SPAN monitoring twice (on the receive function of the port on the left, and the transmit function of the port on the right), so SPAN would send two copies of this single frame to the destination port. Overall, this SPAN session would send twice as many frames as necessary out the SPAN destination port.\\nA much more efficient choice would be to use either the receive or transmit direction for \\nthe SPAN session. Figure 26-22 shows the logic, but now with the Tx bubbles removed, implying that SPAN has been enabled in the receive direction only. As a result, that one example frame sent by PC1 to PC3 is seen only once by SPAN’s monitoring logic, and       only one copy of the frame is sent to the destination port.\\n1 3\\n2 4Rx\\nRxRx\\nRx1Layer 2 Switch\\nFigure 26-22 Frame from PC1 to PC3—SPAN Copies Once\\nptg17396363726  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

on enterprise network architecture\\n4.2.a Traffic path to internal and external cloud services\\n4.2.b Virtual services4.2.c Basic virtual network infrastructure\\nCloud computing is an approach to offering IT services to customers. However, cloud com-\\nputing is not a product, or a set of products, a protocol, or any single thing. So, while there are accepted descriptions and definitions of cloud computing today, it takes a broad knowl-edge of IT beyond networking to know whether a particular IT service is or is not worthy of being called a cloud computing service.\\nCloud computing, or cloud, is an approach as to how to offer services to customers. For an \\nIT service to be considered to be cloud computing, it should have these characteristics: It can be requested on-demand; it can dynamically scale (that is, it is elastic); it uses a pool of resources; it has a variety of network access options; and it can be measured and billed back to the user based on the amount used. \\nFrom an exam perspective, the cloud topic for this chapter (and the SDN/programmabil-\\nity topic in Chapter 28) departs from the typical CCNA R&S types of topics. Around the mid-2010s, Cisco began adding some coverage of emerging technologies to some of its exams, even technologies that might be unrelated to the core of the exam. While cloud was a popular IT practice by 2016 (the publication year of this book), cloud topics stray pretty far from the core routing and switching topics that comprise most of the ICND2 and CCNA R&S exams. So the cloud computing material poses a unique challenge.\\nThis chapter attempts to give you a general idea of the cloud issues as described by sev-\\neral cloud exam topics. To do that, this chapter begins with one major section that defines cloud computing, with some background in server virtualization to start. Following that, the second major section discusses one of the key cloud exam topics, discussing the traffic patterns that occur with and without the use of cloud services. The third and final major section of this chapter then introduces the idea of a virtualized network function and how public cloud providers provide some services while customers provide others.\\n“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help you decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

We might think about IT as servers, and databases, and networks, and security, and all the related hardware and software. But from the other direction, the goal is to run the business operations of the enterprise, using different applications, and IT’s business is to deliver those applications to the rest of the company.\\nCloud computing refers to one approach to providing some kinds of IT services. That \\napproach focuses on the service more than the technology. But before you can begin to appreciate cloud computing, this section needs to introduce some concepts and terminol-ogy from the world of virtualized data centers. Following that, this first section defines and explains cloud computing.\\nServer Virtualization \\nWhen you think of a server, what comes to mind? Is it a desktop computer with a fast CPU? A desktop computer with lots of RAM? Is it hardware that would not sit upright on the floor, but could be easily bolted into a rack in a data center? When you think of a server, do you not even think of hardware, but of the server operating system (OS), running somewhere as a virtual machine (VM)?\\nAll those answers are accurate from one perspective or another, but in most every other \\ndiscussion within the scope of the CCNA R&S certification, we ignore those details. From the perspective of most CCNA R&S discussions, a server is a place  to run applications, with users connecting to those applications over the network. The book then represents the server with an icon that looks like a desktop computer (that is the standard Cisco icon for a server). This next topic breaks down some different perspectives on what it means to be a server, and prepares us to then discuss cloud computing.\\nCisco Server Hardware\\nThink about the form factor    of servers for a moment—that is, the shape and size of the physical server. If you were to build a server of your own, what would it look like? How \\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   733\\nbig, how wide, how tall, and so on? Even if you have never seen a device characterized as a \\nserver, consider these key facts:\\nNo KVM: For most servers, there is no permanent user that sits near the server; all the \\nusers and administrators connect to the server over the network. As a result, there is no need for a permanent keyboard, video display, or mouse (collectively   referred to as KVM).\\nRacks of servers in a data center: In the early years of servers, a server was any computer \\nwith relatively fast CPU, large amounts of RAM, and so on. Today, companies put many servers into one room—a data center—and one goal is to not waste space. So, making servers with a form factor that fits in a standard rack makes for more efficient use of the available space—especially when you do not expect people to be sitting in front of each server.\\nAs an example, Figure 27-1 shows a photo of server hardware from Cisco. While you might \\nthink of Cisco as a networking company, around 2010, Cisco expanded its product line into the server market, with the Cisco   Unified Computing System (UCS) product line. The photo shows a product from the UCS B-Series (Blade series) that uses a rack-mountable chassis, with slots for server blades. The product shown in the figure can be mounted in a rack—note the holes on the sides—with eight server blades (four on each side) mounted    horizon-tally. It also has four power supplies at the bottom of the chassis.\\nFigure 27-1 Cisco UCS Servers: B-Series (Blade)\\nNo matter the form factor, server hardware today supplies some capacity of CPU chips, RAM, storage, and network interface cards (NIC). But you also have to think differently about the OS that runs on the server because of a tool called server virtualization.\\nServer Virtualization Basics \\nThink of a server—the hardware—as one computer. It can be one of the blades in Figure 27-1, a powerful computer you can buy at the local computer store…whatever. Traditionally, when you think of one server, that one server runs one OS. Inside, the hard-ware includes a CPU, some RAM, some kind of permanent storage (like disk drives), and \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 B 2 A 3 A 4 A, C 5 C\\nptg17396363734  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\none or more NICs. And that one OS can use all the hardware inside the server, and then run   \\none or more applications. Figure 27-2 shows those main ideas. \\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating SystemApp1 App2 App3 App4\\nFigure 27-2 Physical Server Model: Physical Hardware, One OS, and Applications\\nWith the physical server model shown in Figure 27-2, each physical server runs one OS, and that OS uses all the hardware in that one server. That was true of servers in the days before server virtualization.\\nToday, most companies instead   create a virtualized data center. That means the company \\npurchases server hardware, installs it in racks, and then treats all the CPU, RAM, and so on as capacity in the data center. Then, each OS instance is decoupled from the hardware, and is therefore virtual (in contrast to physical). Each piece of hardware that we would formerly have thought of as a server runs multiple instances of an OS at the same time, with each vir-tual OS instance   called a virtual machine, or VM. \\nA single physical host (server) often has more processing power than you need for one OS. \\nThinking about processors for a moment, modern server CPUs have multiple cores (proces-sors) in a single CPU chip. Each core may also be able to run multiple threads with a feature called     multithreading. So, when you read about a particular Intel processor with 8 cores \\nand multithreading (typically two threads per core), that one CPU chip can execute 16 dif-ferent programs concurrently. The hypervisor (introduced shortly) can then treat each avail-able thread as a   virtual CPU (vCPU), and give each VM a number of vCPUs, with 16 avail-able in this example.\\nA VM—that is, an OS instance that is decoupled from the server hardware—still must \\nexecute on hardware. Each VM has configuration    as to the minimum number of vCPUs it needs, minimum RAM, and so on. The virtualization system then starts each VM on some physical server so that enough physical server hardware capacity exists to support all the VMs running on that host. So, at any one point in time, each VM is running on a physi-cal server, using a subset of the CPU, RAM, storage, and NICs on that server. Figure 27-3 shows a graphic of that   concept, with four separate VMs running on one physical server.\\nTo make server virtualization work, each physical server (called a host in the server virtual-\\nization world) uses a hypervisor. The hypervisor         manages and allocates the host hardware \\n(CPU, RAM, etc.) to each VM based on the settings for the VM. Each VM runs as if it is running on a self-contained physical server, with a specific number of virtual CPUs and NICs and a set amount of RAM and storage. For instance, if one VM happens to be config-ured to use four CPUs, with 8 GB of RAM, the hypervisor allocates the specific parts of the CPU and RAM that the VM actually uses.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   735\\nApp\\nOS OS OS OS\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkHypervisorApp AppVirtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine\\nApp App App App App App App App App\\nFigure 27-3 Four VMs Running on One Host; Hypervisor Manages the Hardware\\nTo connect the marketplace to the big ideas discussed thus far, the following list includes a \\nfew of the vendors and product family names associated     with virtualized data centers:\\n■VMware vCenter\\n■Microsoft HyperV\\n■Citrix XenServer\\n■Red Hat KVM\\nBeyond the hypervisor, companies like those in the list (and others) sell complete virtualiza-tion systems. These systems allow virtualization engineers to dynamically create VMs, start them, move them (manually and automatically) to different servers, and stop them. For instance, when hardware maintenance needs to be performed, the virtualization engineer can move the VMs to another host (often while running) so that the   maintenance can be done.\\nNetworking with Virtual Switches on a Virtualized Host\\nServer virtualization tools provide a wide variety of options for how to connect VMs to networks. This book does not attempt to discuss them all, but it can help to get some of the basics down before thinking more about cloud computing.\\nFirst, what does a physical server include     for networking functions? Typically it has one or \\nmore NICs, maybe as slow as 1 Gbps, often 10 Gbps today, and maybe as fast as 40 Gbps.\\nNext, think about the VMs. Normally, an OS has one NIC, maybe more. To make the OS \\nwork as normal, each VM has (at least) one NIC, but for a VM, it is a virtual NIC. (For instance, in VMware’s virtualization systems, the VM’s     virtual NIC goes by the name vNIC.) \\nFinally, the server must combine the ideas of the physical NICs with the vNICs used by the \\nVMs into some kind of a network. Most often, each      server uses some kind of an internal Ethernet switch concept, often called (you guessed it) a virtual switch, or vSwitch. Figure 27-4 shows an example, with four VMs, each with one vNIC. The physical server has two physical NICs. The vNICs and physical NICs connect internally to a virtual switch. \\nptg17396363736  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nVirtual Switch\\nPhysical\\nSwitchServer\\nHardware\\n(Host)\\nTrunksPhysical NIC1 Physical NIC2App\\nOSApp\\nOSApp\\nOSApp\\nOSVirtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine\\nvNIC vNIC vNIC vNIC\\nSW1\\nFigure 27-4 Basic Networking in a Virtualized Host with a Virtual Switch\\nInterestingly, the vSwitch can be supplied by the hypervisor vendor or by Cisco. For \\ninstance, Cisco’s data center switch product line, Cisco Nexus switches, includes the Nexus 1000v (v for virtual). At your option, you can use the vSwitch included by the hypervisor, or install the Cisco Nexus 1000v (or similar products). The Nexus 1000v  then supports some features unique to the Cisco Nexus series of switches. (Note that the Cisco data center switches, and the NX-OS operating system that runs on the Nexus models of switches, are covered in the CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE Data Center certifications.)\\nThe networking details shown in Figure 27-4 show just the basics, but two important points \\nremain for this chapter’s buildup to cloud. First, networking in the data center has many options. Each VM can be in its own VLAN, or share the same VLAN, or even use VLAN trunking to the VM itself. Second, that configuration can be easily done from within the same virtualization software that controls the VMs. That programmability allows the virtual-ization software to move VMs between hosts (servers), and reprogram the vSwitches so that the VM has       the same networking capabilities no matter where the VM is running.\\nThe Physical Data Center Network\\nTo pull these ideas together, next consider what happens with the physical network in a vir-tualized data center. Each host—that is, the     physical host—needs a physical connection to the network. Looking again at Figure 27-4, that host, with two physical NICs, needs to con-nect those two physical NICs to a LAN in the data center.\\nFigure 27-5 shows the traditional cabling for a data center LAN. Each taller rectangle rep-\\nresents one rack inside a data center, with the tiny squares representing NIC ports, and the lines representing cables. \\nOften, each host is cabled to two different switches in the top of the rack—called    Top of \\nRack (ToR) switches—to provide redundant paths into the LAN. Each ToR switch acts as an access layer switch from a design perspective. Each ToR switch is then cabled to an End of Row (EoR) switch, which acts as a distribution switch, and     also connects to the rest of the network.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   737\\nToR EoR\\nToR EoR\\nServer\\nServerServerServerServerServerToRToR\\nServerServerServerServerServerServerToRToR\\nServerServerServerServerServerServer\\nFigure 27-5 Traditional Data Center Top-of-Rack and End-of-Row Physical Switch \\nTopology\\nWorkflow with a Virtualized Data Center\\nSo far, the first part of this chapter has described background information important to the \\nupcoming discussions of cloud computing. Server     virtualization has been a great improve-ment to the operations of many data centers, but virtualization alone does not create a cloud computing environment. Continuing the discussion of these fundamental technolo-gies before discussing cloud computing, consider this example of a workflow through a virtualized (not cloud based) data center.\\nSome of the IT staff, call them server or virtualization engineers or administrators, order \\nand install new hosts (servers). They gather requirements, plan for the required capacity, shop for hardware, order it, and install the hardware. They play the role of long-time server administrators and engineers, but now they work with the virtualization tools as well.\\nFor the virtualization parts of the effort, the virtualization engineers also install and custom-\\nize the virtualization tools. Beyond the hypervisor on each host, many other useful tools help manage and control a virtualized data center. For instance, one tool might give the engineers a view of the data center as a whole, with all VMs running there, with the idea that one data center is just a lot of capacity to run VMs. Over time, the server/virtualization engineers add new physical servers to the data center, and configure the virtualization sys-tems to make use of the new physical servers, and make sure it all works.\\nSo far in this scenario, the work has been in preparation for providing services to some \\ninternal customer—a development team member, the operations staff, and so on. Now, a customer is requesting a “server.” In truth, the customer wants a VM (or many), with certain requirements: a specific number of vCPUs, a specific     amount of RAM, and so on. The cus-tomer makes a request to the virtualization/server engineer to set up the VMs, as shown in Figure 27-6.\\nptg17396363738  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nVirtualization\\nSoftwareClicks\\nServer/\\nVirtualization\\nEngineersAdd,\\nMove,Delete VMs\\nScriptGUI\\nAPI\\nRacks of Servers, Switches, SANData Center\\nChange\\nRequests\\nCustomers:\\nDevelopers,\\nOperators21\\n3\\nFigure 27-6 Traditional Workflow: Customer (Human) Asks Virtualization (Human) for \\nService\\nThe figure emphasizes what happens after the customer makes a request, which flows some-\\nthing like this:\\nStep 1. The customer of the IT group, such as a developer or a member of the opera-\\ntions staff, wants some service, like a set of new VMs. \\nStep 2. The virtualization/server engineer reacts to the request from the customer. The \\nserver/virtualization engineer clicks away at the user interface, or if the number \\nof VMs is large, they often run a program called a script to more efficiently create the VMs. \\nStep 3. Regardless of whether the virtualization engineer clicked or used scripts, the \\nvirtualization software could then create a number of new VMs and start those on some hosts inside the data center.\\nThe process shown in Figure 27-6 works great. However, that approach to providing ser-\\nvices breaks some of the basic criteria of a cloud service. For instance, cloud computing requires self-service. For the workflow to be considered to be a cloud service, the process as Step 2 should not require a human to service that request, but instead the request should be filled automatically. Want some new VMs in a cloud world? Click a user interface to ask for some new VMs, go get a cup of coffee, and your VMs will have been set up and started, to your     specification, in minutes.\\nSummarizing some of the key points about a virtualized data center made so far, which \\nenable cloud computing:\\n■The OS is decoupled from the hardware on which it runs, so that the OS, as a VM, can\\nrun on any server in a data center that has enough resources to run the VM.\\n■The virtualization software can automatically start and move the VM between servers in\\nthe data center.\\n■Data center networking includes virtual switches and virtual NICs within each host\\n(server).\\n■Data center networking can be programmed by the virtualization software, allowing new\\nVMs to be configured, started, moved as needed, and     stopped, with the networking\\ndetails configured automatically.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   739\\nCloud Computing Services \\nCloud computing is an approach to offering IT services. Cloud computing makes use of \\nproducts such as the virtualization products, but also uses products built specifically to enable cloud features. However, cloud computing is not just a set of products to be imple-mented; instead, it is a way of offering IT services. So, understanding what cloud computing is and is not takes a little work; this next topic introduces the basics. \\nFrom the just-completed discussions about virtualization, you already know one characteris-\\ntic of a cloud service: it must allow self-service provisioning by the consumer of the service. That is, the consumer or customer of the service must be able to request the service and receive that service without the delay of waiting for a human to have time to work on it, consider the request, do the work, and so on. \\nTo get a broader sense of what it means for a service to be a cloud service, examine this \\nlist of five criteria for a        cloud computing service. The list is derived from the definition of cloud computing as put forth by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):\\nOn-demand self-service: The IT consumer chooses when to start and stop using the ser-\\nvice, without any direct    interaction with the provider of the service. \\nBroad network access: The service    must be available from many types of devices and \\nover many types of networks (including the Internet). \\nResource pooling: The provider creates     a pool of resources (rather than dedicating spe-\\ncific servers for use only by certain consumers), and dynamically allocates resources from that pool for each new request from a consumer. \\nRapid elasticity: To the consumer, the resource     pool appears to be unlimited (that is, it \\nexpands quickly, so it is called elastic), and the requests for new service are filled quickly.  \\nMeasured service: The provider can measure    the usage and report that usage to the con-\\nsumer, both for transparency and for billing. \\nKeep this list of five criteria in mind while you work through the rest of the chapter. Later \\nparts of the chapter will refer back to the list. \\nTo further develop this definition, the next few pages look at two branches of the cloud \\nuniverse—private cloud and public cloud—also with the goal of further explaining some of the points from the NIST definition. \\nPrivate Cloud\\nLook back to the workflow example in Figure 27-6 with a virtualized data center. Now think about the five NIST criteria for cloud computing. If you break down the list versus the example around Figure 27-6, it seems like the workflow    may meet at least some of these five NIST cloud criteria, and it does. In particular, as described so far in this chapter, a vir-tualized data center pools resources so they can be dynamically allocated. You could argue that a virtualized data center is elastic, in that the resource pool expands. However, the process may not be rapid, because the workflow requires human checks, balances, and time before provisioning new services.\\nptg17396363740  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPrivate cloud creates a service, inside a company, to internal customers, that meets the five \\ncriteria from the NIST list. To create a private cloud, an enterprise often expands its IT tools (like virtualization tools), changes internal workflow processes, adds additional tools, and so on. \\nAs some examples, consider what happens when an application developer at a company \\nneeds VMs to use when developing an application. With private cloud, the developer can request those VMs and those VMs automatically start and are available within minutes, with most of the time lag being the time to boot the VMs. If the developer wants many more VMs, he can assume that the private cloud will have enough capacity, and new requests are still serviced rapidly. And all parties should know that the IT group can measure the usage of the services for internal billing. \\nFocus on the self-service aspect of cloud for a moment. To make that happen, many cloud \\ncomputing services use    a cloud services catalog. That catalog exists for the user as a web \\napplication that lists anything that can be requested via the company’s cloud infrastructure. Before using a private cloud, developers and operators who needed new services (like new VMs) sent a change request asking the virtualization team to add VMs (see Figure 27-6). With private cloud, the (internal) consumers of IT services—developers, operators, and the like—can click to choose from the cloud services catalog. And if the request is for a new set of VMs, the VMs appear and are ready for use in minutes, without human interaction    for that step, as seen at Step 2 of Figure 27-7.\\nClicksDeveloper\\nOperatorData CenterVirtualization\\nSoftwareCloud Services\\nCatalog\\nAdd,\\nMove,DeleteScript\\nCloud\\nTeamConfiguresGUI\\nAPIGUI\\nAPI2\\n13\\nFigure 27-7 Basic Private Cloud Workflow to Create One VM\\nTo make this process work, the cloud team has to add some tools and processes to its vir-\\ntualized data center. For instance, it installs software to create the cloud services catalog, both with a user interface and with code that interfaces to the APIs of the virtualization systems. That services catalog software can react to consumer requests, using APIs into the virtualization software, to add, move, and create VMs, for instance. Also, the cloud team—composed of server, virtualization, network, and storage engineers—focuses on building the resource pool, testing and adding new services to the catalog, handling exceptions, and watching the reports (per the measured service requirement) to know when to add capacity to keep the resource pool ready to handle all requests. \\nNotably, with the cloud model, the cloud team no longer spends time handling individual \\nrequests for adding 10 VMs here, 50 there, with change requests from different groups.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   741\\nSummarizing, with private cloud, you change your methods and tools to offer some of the \\nsame services. Private cloud is “private” in that one company owns the tools that create the cloud and employs the people who use the services. Even inside one company, using a cloud computing approach can improve the operational speed of deploying    IT services.\\nPublic Cloud\\nWith a private cloud, the cloud provider    and the cloud consumer are part of the same com-pany. With public cloud, the reverse is true: a public cloud provider offers services, selling those services to consumers in other companies. In fact, if you think of Internet service pro-viders and WAN service providers selling Internet and WAN services to many enterprises, the same general idea works here with public cloud providers selling their services to many enterprises.\\nThe workflow in public cloud happens somewhat like private cloud when you start from \\nthe point of a consumer asking for some service (like a new VM). As shown on the right of Figure 27-8, at Step 1, the consumer asks for the new service from the service catalog web page. At Step 2, the virtualization tools react to the request to create the service. Once started, the services are available, but running in a data center that resides somewhere else in the world, and certainly not at the enterprise’s data center (Step 3).\\nService Catalog Virtualization\\nData CenterPublic Cloud Provider\\nVM VM\\nVMVMInternet2\\n3Enterprise (Consumer)\\nDev, Ops1\\nFigure 27-8 Public Cloud Provider in the Internet\\nOf course, the consumer is in a different network than the cloud provider with cloud com-puting, which brings up the issue of how to connect to a cloud provider. Cloud providers support multiple network options. They each connect to the Internet, so that apps and users inside the consumer’s network can communicate with the apps that the consumer runs in the cloud provider’s network. However, one of the five NIST criteria for cloud comput-ing is broad network access, so cloud providers offer different networking options as well, including virtual private network (VPN) and private wide-area network (WAN) connections between consumers and    the cloud.\\nCloud and the “As a Service” Model\\nSo what do you get with cloud computing? So far, this chapter has just shown a VM as a service. With cloud computing, there are a variety of services, and three stand out as the most common seen in the market today.\\nFirst, a quick word about some upcoming terminology. The cloud computing world works \\non a services model. Instead of buying (consuming) hardware, buying or licensing software, \\nptg17396363742  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\ninstalling it yourself, and so on, the consumer receives some service from the provider. But \\nthat idea, receiving a service, is more abstract than the idea of buying a server and installing a particular software package. So with cloud computing, instead of keeping the discussion so generic, the industry uses a variety of terms that end in “as a Service.” And each “-aaS” term has a   different meaning.\\nThis next topic explains those three most common cloud services: Infrastructure as a \\nService, Software as a Service, and Platform as a Service.\\nInfrastructure as a Service\\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) may     be the easiest of the cloud computing services to understand for most people. For perspective, think about any time you have shopped for a computer. You thought about the OS to run (the latest Microsoft OS, or Linux, or OS X if shopping for a Mac). You compared prices based on the CPU and its speed, how much RAM the computer had, the size of the disk drive, and so on. \\nIaaS offers a similar idea, but the consumer  receives the use of a VM. You specify the \\namount of hardware performance/capacity to allocate to the VM (number of virtual CPUs, amount of RAM, and so on) as shown in Figure 27-9. You can even pick an OS to use. Once selected, the cloud provider starts the VM, which boots the chosen OS. \\nNOTE In the virtualization and cloud world, starting a VM    is often called spinning up a\\nVM or instantiating a VM.\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating System (Optional) User Picks\\nUser PicksCustomer Installs Apps Later\\n12\\n1\\nFigure 27-9 IaaS Concept\\nThe provider also gives the consumer details about the VM so the consumer can connect to the OS’s user interface, install more software, and customize settings. For example, imag-ine that the consumer wants to run a particular application on the server. If that customer wanted to use Microsoft Exchange as an email server, she would then need connect to the VM and install Exchange. \\nFigure 27-10 shows a web page from   Amazon Web Services (AWS), a public cloud pro-\\nvider, from which you could create a VM as part of its IaaS service. The screenshot shows that the user selected a small VM called “micro.” If you look closely at the text, you may be able to read the heading and numbers to see that this particular VM has one vCPU     and 1 GB of RAM. (Note that this particular VM happens to be available as a free trial from AWS.) \\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   743\\nFigure 27-10 AWS Screenshot—Set Up VM with Different CPU/RAM/OS\\nSoftware as a Service\\nWith Software as a Service (SaaS), the consumer      receives a service with working software. \\nThe cloud provider may use VMs, possibly many VMs, to create the service, but those are hidden from the consumer. The cloud provider licenses, installs, and supports whatever software is required. The cloud provider then monitors performance of the application. However, the consumer chooses to use the application, signs up for the service, and starts using the application—no further installation work required. Figure 27-11 shows these main concepts.  \\nApplication User Picks\\nOS,\\nHardwareHidden1\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating System (Optional)2\\nFigure 27-11 SaaS Concept\\nMany of you have probably used or at least heard of many public SaaS offerings. File stor-\\nage services like Apple iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box are all SaaS offerings. Most online email offerings can be considered SaaS services today. As another example, Microsoft offers its Exchange email server software as a service, so you can have private email services but offered as a service, along with all the other features included with Exchange—but without      having to license, install, and maintain the Exchange software on some VMs.\\n(Development) Platform as a Service\\nPlatform as a Service (PaaS) is a development      platform, prebuilt as a service. A PaaS service is like IaaS in some ways. Both supply the consumer with one (or more) VMs, with a con-figurable amount of CPU, RAM, and other resources.\\nptg17396363744  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe key difference between PaaS and IaaS is that PaaS includes many more software tools \\nbeyond the basic OS. Those tools are useful to a software developer during the software development process. Once the development process is complete, and the application has been rolled out in production, those tools are not needed on the servers running the appli-cation. So the development tools are particular to the work done when developing. \\nA PaaS offering includes a set of development tools, and each PaaS offering has a differ-\\nent combination of tools. PaaS VMs often include an integrated development environment (IDE), which is a set of related tools that enables the developer to write and test code easily. PaaS VMs include continuous integration tools that allow the developer to update code and have that code automatically tested and integrated into a larger software project. Examples include   Google’s App Engine PaaS offering (https://cloud.google.com/appengine), the   Eclipse integrated development environment (see http://www.eclipse.org), and the   Jenkins continuous integration and automation tool (see https://jenkins.io).\\nThe primary reasons to choose one PaaS service over another, or to choose a PaaS solu-\\ntion instead of IaaS, is the mix of development tools. Without experience as a developer, it can be difficult to tell whether one PaaS service might be better. You can still make some choices about sizing the PaaS VMs, similar to IaaS tools when setting up some PaaS services, as shown in Figure 27-12, but the developer tools included are the     key to a PaaS service.\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating SystemDevelopment Environment and Tools (Platform)Primary\\nFactor\\nFigure 27-12 PaaS Concept\\nWAN Traffic Paths to Reach Cloud Services\\nThe just-completed first major section of this chapter has set up the story of cloud comput-\\ning enough to now discuss the cloud-related exam topics in the ICND2 and CCNA R&S exams. The first section has defined a few details about cloud computing, just enough to discuss the exam topics. This second section explains some networking issues about how to access those services.\\nThis second major section of the chapter focuses on WAN options for public cloud, and \\nthe pros and cons of each. This section ignores private cloud for the most part, because using a private cloud—which is internal to an enterprise—has much less of an impact on an enterprise WAN compared to public cloud. With public cloud, the cloud services exist on the other side of some WAN connection as compared to the consumer of the services, so network engineers must think about how to best build a WAN when using public cloud services.\\nEnterprise WAN Connections to Public Cloud\\nUsing the Internet to communicate between the enterprise and a public cloud provider is easy and convenient. However, it also has some negatives. This first section describes the \\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   745\\nbasics, and points out the issues, which then leads to some of the reasons why using other \\nWAN connections may be preferred.\\nAccessing Public Cloud Services Using the Internet\\nImagine an enterprise that        operates its network without cloud. All the applications it uses to run its business run on servers in a data center inside the enterprise. The OS instances where those applications run can be hosted directly on physical servers, or on VMs in a virtualized data center, but all the servers exist somewhere inside the enterprise.\\nNow imagine that the IT staff starts moving some of those applications out to a public \\ncloud service. How do the users of the application (inside the enterprise) get to the user interface of the application (which runs at the public cloud provider’s data center)? The Internet, of course. Both the enterprise and the cloud provider connect to the Internet, so using the Internet is the easy and convenient choice.\\nNow consider a common workflow to move an internal application to now run on the pub-\\nlic cloud, for the purpose of making a couple of important points. First, Figure 27-13 shows the example. The cloud provider’s services catalog can be reached by enterprise personnel, over the Internet, as shown at Step 1. After choosing the desired services—for instance, some VMs for an IaaS service—the cloud provider (Step 2) instantiates the VMs. Then, not shown as a step in the figure, the VMs are customized to now run the app that was formerly running inside the enterprise’s data center.\\nWeb Portal Virtualization\\nData CenterPublic Cloud Provider Enterprise\\nDev, Ops\\nVM VM\\nVMVMInternet\\nUsers21\\n3\\n4VM\\nFigure 27-13 Accessing a Public Cloud Service Using the Internet\\nAt this point, the new app is running in the cloud, and those services will require network bandwidth. In particular, Step 3 shows users communicating with the applications, just as would happen with any other application. Additionally, most apps send much more data than just the data between the application and the end user. For instance, you might move an app to the public cloud, but you might keep authentication services on an internal server, because those are used by a large number of applications—some internal and some hosted in the public cloud. So at Step 4, any application communication between VMs hosted        in the cloud to/from VMs hosted inside the enterprise also needs to take place.\\nPros and Cons with Connecting to Public Cloud with Internet\\nUsing the Internet to connect        from the enterprise to the Internet has several advantages. The most obvious advantage is that all companies and cloud providers already have Internet connections, so getting started using public cloud services is easy. Using the Internet works \\nptg17396363746  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nparticularly well with SaaS services and a distributed work force. For instance, maybe your \\nsales division uses a SaaS customer contact app. Often, salespeople do not sit inside the enterprise network most of the work day. They likely connect to the Internet, and use a VPN to connect to the enterprise. For apps hosted on the public cloud, with this user base, it makes perfect sense to use the Internet.\\nWhile that was just one example, the following list summarizes some good reasons to use \\nthe Internet as the WAN connection to a public cloud service: \\nAgility: An enterprise can get started using public cloud without having to wait to order a \\nprivate WAN connection to the cloud provider because cloud providers support Internet connectivity.\\nMigration: An enterprise can switch its workload from one cloud provider to another \\nmore easily because cloud providers all connect to the Internet.\\nDistributed users: The enterprise’s users are distributed and connect to the Internet with \\ntheir devices (as in the sales SaaS app example).\\nUsing the Internet as the WAN connectivity to a public cloud is both a blessing and a curse \\nin some ways. Using the Internet can help you get started with public cloud, and to get working quickly, but it also means that you do not have to do any planning before deploy-ing a public cloud service. With a little planning, a network engineer can see some of the negatives of using the Internet—the same negatives when using the Internet for other pur-poses—which then might make you want to use alternative WAN connections. Those nega-tives        for using the Internet for public cloud access are\\nSecurity: The Internet is less secure than private WAN connections in that a “man in the \\nmiddle” can attempt to read the contents of data that passes to/from the public cloud.\\nCapacity: Moving an internal application to the public cloud increases network traffic, \\nso the question of whether the enterprise’s Internet links can handle the additional load needs to be considered.\\nQuality of Service (QoS): The Internet does not provide QoS, whereas private WANs \\ncan. Using the Internet may result in a worse user experience than desired, because of higher delay (latency), jitter, and packet loss.  \\nNo WAN SLA: ISPs typically will not provide a service level agreement (SLA) for WAN \\nperformance and availability to all destinations of a network. WAN service providers are much more likely to offer performance and availability SLAs.  \\nThis list of concerns does not mean that an        enterprise cannot use the Internet to access its \\npublic cloud services. It does mean that it should consider the pros and cons of each WAN option. \\nPrivate WAN and Internet VPN Access to Public Cloud\\nThe NIST definition for cloud computing         lists “broad network access” as one of the five main criteria. In the case of public cloud, that often means supporting a variety of WAN connections, including the most common enterprise WAN technologies. Basically, an enter-prise can connect to a public cloud provider with WAN technologies discussed in this book. For the sake of discussion, Figure 27-14 breaks it down into two broad categories. \\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   747\\nPublic Cloud Provider Enterprise\\nPrivate WAN\\nInternetVPN Tunnel\\nFigure 27-14 Using Private WAN to a Public Cloud: Security, QoS, Capacity, Reporting\\nTo create a VPN tunnel between the enterprise and the cloud provider, you can use the \\nsame VPN features discussed earlier in Chapter 15, “Private WANs with Internet VPN.” The cloud provider can offer a VPN service—that is, the cloud side of the VPN tunnel is imple-mented by the cloud provider—and the enterprise configures       the matching VPN service on one of its own routers. Or the enterprise can use its own router inside the cloud provider’s network—a virtual router, running as a VM—and configure VPN services on that router. In fact, Cisco makes the Cloud Services Router (CSR) to     do exactly that: to be a router, but a router that runs as a VM in a cloud service, controlled by the cloud consumer, to do various functions that routers do, including terminating VPNs. (Also, by running a virtual router as a VM and managing the configuration internally, the enterprise might save some of the cost of using a similar service offered by the cloud provider.)\\nTo make a private Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN or Ethernet WAN connec-\\ntion, the enterprise needs to work with the cloud provider and the WAN provider. Because cloud providers connect to many customers with    private WAN connections, they often have published set instructions to follow. In the most basic form, with MPLS, the enterprise and the cloud provider connect to the same MPLS provider, with the MPLS provider con-necting the enterprise and cloud sites. The same basic process happens with Ethernet WAN services, with one or more EVCs created between the public WAN and the enterprise. \\nNOTE Often, the server/virtualization engineers will dictate whether the WAN connection needs to support Layer 2 or Layer 3 connectivity, depending on other factors. \\nPrivate WAN connections also require some physical planning. Each of the larger public cloud providers has a number of large data centers spread around the planet, and with pre-built connection points into the major WAN services to aid the creation of private WAN connections to customers. An enterprise might then look at the cloud provider’s documen-tation and work with that provider to choose the best place to install the private WAN connection. (Those larger public cloud companies include Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace, if you would like to look at their web-sites         for information about their locations.)\\nPros and Cons with Connecting to Cloud with Private WANs \\nPrivate WANs overcome some of the issues of using the Internet without VPN, so working through those issues, consider some of the different WAN options. \\nFirst, considering the issue of security, all the private options, including adding a VPN to \\nthe existing Internet connection, improve security significantly. An Internet VPN would \\nptg17396363748  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nencrypt the data to keep it private. Private WAN connections with MPLS and Ethernet have \\ntraditionally been considered secure without encryption, but companies are sometimes         encrypting data sent over private WAN connections as well to make the network more secure.\\nRegarding QoS, using an Internet VPN solution still fails to provide QoS because the \\nInternet does not provide QoS. WAN services like MPLS VPN and Ethernet WANs can. As discussed in Chapter 18, “Quality of Service (QoS),” WAN providers will look at the QoS markings for frames/packets sent by the customer, and apply QoS tools to the traffic as it passes through the service provider’s network.\\nFinally, as for the capacity issue, the concern of planning network capacity exists no matter \\nwhat type of WAN is used. Any plan to migrate an app away from an internal data center to instead be hosted as a public cloud provider requires extra thought and planning. \\nSeveral negatives exist for using a private WAN, as you might expect. Installing the new pri-\\nvate WAN connections takes time, delaying when a company gets started in cloud comput-ing. Private WANs typically cost more than using the Internet. If using a WAN connection to one cloud provider (instead of using the Internet), then migrating to a new cloud provider can require another round of private WAN installation, again delaying work projects. Using the Internet (with or without VPN) would have made that migration much easier, but as shown         in the next section, a strong compromise solution exists as well. \\nIntercloud Exchanges \\nPublic cloud computing also introduces a whole new level of competition, because a cloud consumer can move their workload     from one cloud provider to another. Moving the work-load takes some effort, for a variety of reasons beyond the scope of this book. (Suffice it to say that most cloud providers differ in the detail of how they implement services.) But enterprises can and do migrate their workload from one cloud provider to another, choos-ing a new company for a variety of reasons, including looking for a less expensive cloud provider.\\nNow focus on the networking connections again. The main negative with using a private \\nWAN for the cloud is that it adds another barrier to migrating to a new public cloud pro-vider. One solution adds easier migration to the use of a private WAN through a cloud ser-vice called an intercloud exchange (or simply an intercloud).\\nGenerically, the term intercloud exchange has come to be known as a company that creates \\na private network as a service. First, an intercloud exchange connects to multiple cloud pro-viders on one side. On the other side, the intercloud connects to cloud consumers. Figure 27-15 shows the idea.\\nOnce connected, the cloud consumer can be configured to communicate with one pub-\\nlic cloud provider today, to specific cloud provider sites. Later, if the consumer wants to migrate to use another cloud provider, the consumer keeps the same private WAN links to the intercloud exchange, and asks the provider to reconfigure to set up new private WAN connections to the new cloud provider.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   749\\nEnterpriseIntercloud Exchange Public Cloud 1\\nR1\\nPublic Cloud 2\\nR1Private\\nWANPrivate\\nWAN\\nPrivate\\nWAN\\nFigure 27-15 Permanent Private WAN Connection to an Intercloud Exchange\\nAs for pros and cons, with an intercloud exchange, you get the same benefits as when con-\\nnecting with a private WAN connection to a public cloud, but with the additional pro of easier migration to a new cloud provider. The main con is that using an intercloud exchange introduces another company into the mix. \\nNote that Cisco has a related set of products   (called Cisco Intercloud Fabric) that helps \\nsolve many of the other migration challenges with moving workloads from one cloud pro-vider to the next. These software tools from Cisco do not provide an intercloud exchange WAN service, but they do solve many of the challenges that exist when managing cloud workloads across both private and public cloud across a variety of WAN connection     options. Look to http://www.cisco.com/go/intercloud for more details.\\nSummarizing the Pros and Cons of Public Cloud WAN Options\\nTable 27-2 summarizes some of these key pros and         cons for the public WAN options for cloud computing, for study and reference.\\nTable 27-2 Comparison of Key Pros and Cons\\nInternet Internet \\nVPNMPLS \\nVPNEthernet WANIntercloud Exchange\\nS e c u re No Ye s Ye s Ye s Ye s\\nQ o S No No Ye s Ye s Ye s\\nRequires capacity planning Y es Y es Y es Y es Y es\\nEasier migration to new provider Y es Y es No No Y es\\nCan begin using public cloud quickly Y es Y es No No No\\nA Scenario: Branch Offices and the Public Cloud\\nSo far in this major section about WAN design     with public cloud, the enterprise has been \\nshown as one entity, but most enterprise WANs have many sites. Those distributed enter-prise sites impact some parts of WAN design for public cloud. The next discussion of WAN design issues with public cloud works through a scenario that shows an enterprise with a typical central site and branch office.\\nThe example used in this section is a common one: the movement away from internal email \\nservers, supported directly by the IT staff, to email delivered as a SaaS offering. Focus on the impact of the enterprise’s remote sites like branch offices.\\nptg17396363750  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nMigrating Traffic Flows When Migrating to Email SaaS\\nFirst, think of the traffic flow inside an enterprise before SaaS, when the company buys \\nservers, licenses email server software, installs the hardware and software in an internal data center, and so on. The company may have hundreds or thousands of remote sites, like the branch office shown in Figure 27-16. To check email, an employee at the       branch office sends packets back and forth with the email server at the central site, as shown.\\nInternetPublic Cloud Central Site\\nEmail Servers\\nEmail Traffic\\nBranch OfficePrivate\\nWAN\\nFigure 27-16 Traffic Flow: Private WAN, Enterprise Implements Email Services\\nThe company then looks at the many different costs for email in this old model versus the \\nnew SaaS model. For instance, Microsoft Exchange is a very popular software package to build those enterprise email servers. Microsoft, who as a company is a major player in the public cloud space with their Microsoft Azure service, offers Exchange as a SaaS service. (During the writing of this book, this particular service could be found as part of Office 365 or as “Exchange Online.”) So the enterprise considers the options and chooses to migrate an email SaaS offering.\\nOnce migrated, the email servers run in the cloud, but as a SaaS service. The enterprise IT \\nstaff, who are the customers of the SaaS service, do not have to manage the servers. Just to circle back to some big ideas, as a SaaS service, the consumer does not worry about install-ing VMs, sizing them, installing Exchange or some other email server software, and so on. The consumer receives email service in this case. The company does have to do some migra-tion work to move existing email, contacts, and so on, but once migrated, all users now communicate with email servers that run in the cloud as a SaaS service.\\nNow think about that enterprise branch office user, and the traffic flows shown in Figure \\n27-17, when a branch user sends or receives an email. For instance, think of an email with a large attachment, just to make the impact more dramatic. If the enterprise     design connects branches to the central sites only, this is the net effect on WAN traffic:\\n■No reduction in private WAN traffic at all occurs, because all the branch office email\\ntraffic flows to/from the central site.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   751\\n■100 percent of the email traffic—even internal emails—that flows to/from branches now\\nalso flows over the Internet connection, consuming the bandwidth of the enterprise’s\\nInternet links.\\nInternetPublic Cloud Central Site\\nEmail Servers\\nEmail Traffic\\nBranch OfficePrivate\\nWAN\\nFigure 27-17 Traffic Flow: Private WAN, Enterprise Implements Email Services\\nJust to make the point, imagine two users at the same branch office. They can see each \\nother across the room. One wants to share a file with the other, but the most convenient way they know to share a file is to email the file as an attachment. So one of them sends an email to the other, attaching the 20-MB file to the email. Before using SaaS, with an email server at the central site, that email and file would flow over the private WAN, to the email server, and then back to the second user’s email client. With this new design, that email with the 20-MB attachment would flow over the private WAN, then over the Internet to the email server, and then back       again over the Internet and over the private WAN when the sec-ond user downloads her email.\\nBranch Offices with Internet and Private WAN\\nFor enterprises that place their Internet connections primarily at the central sites, this pub-lic cloud model can cause problems            like the one just described. One way to deal with this particular challenge is to plan the right capacity for the Internet links; another is to plan capacity for some private WAN connections to the public cloud. Another option exists as well: redesign the enterprise WAN to a small degree, and consider placing direct Internet connections at the branch offices. Then all Internet traffic, including the email traffic to the new SaaS service, could be sent directly, and not consume the private WAN bandwidth or the central site Internet link bandwidth, as shown in Figure 27-18.\\nThe design in Figure 27-18 has several advantages. The traffic flows much more directly. It \\ndoes not waste the WAN bandwidth for the central site. And broadband Internet connec-tions are relatively inexpensive today compared to private WAN connections. \\nptg17396363752  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nInternetPublic Cloud Central Site\\nEmail Servers\\nEmail Traffic\\nEmail\\nTraffic\\nBranch OfficePrivateWAN\\nFigure 27-18 Connecting Branches Directly to the Internet for Public Cloud Traffic\\nHowever, when the per-branch Internet connections are added for the first time, the new \\nInternet links create security concerns. One of the reasons an enterprise might use only a few Internet links, located at a central site, is to focus the security efforts at those links. Using an Internet connection at each branch changes that approach. But many enterprises not only use the Internet at each site, but rely on it as their only WAN connection, as shown with Internet VPNs     back in Chapter 15.\\nVirtual Network Functions and Services\\nThis third and final major section of the chapter now looks more closely at what happens with networking functions inside the public cloud environment. In particular, this section introduces the concept of a   virtual network function (VNF), by showing how a public cloud installation could implement routers and firewalls as VMs. The remainder of this section looks at options for changing how DNS, DHCP, and NTP could work when migrating an application from inside an enterprise to being hosted in a public cloud service.\\nVirtual Network Functions: Firewalls and Routers\\nWhen you start to peel     back the layers of what you get in a public cloud service, you can begin to see familiar functions and features. Public cloud providers may not use all the same old terminology for traditional approaches to IT, but to anyone who has worked in IT, many of the ideas should look familiar. \\nAs an example, take the following basic scenario in which an enterprise orders an IaaS ser-\\nvice from a public cloud provider:\\n■The consumer wants a number of IaaS servers.\\n■All VMs will run the same app; the consumer wants multiple VMs to deal with server\\nload.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   753\\n■Because they run the same app, the consumer does not care which particular server any\\none client uses, so the consumer wants the cloud provider to perform server load balanc-\\ning (SLB).\\n■The consumer will use the Internet for all user traffic to the VMs.\\nFigure 27-19 shows the kind of information the consumer would receive back from \\nthe cloud provider, along with the functions provided. It includes a public IP address (198.51.100.1). Each IaaS server gets its own private IP address, from the cloud provider’s private IPv4 address space. The provider performs   SLB as a service (SLBaaS). (And not shown in the     figure for now, the provider also supplies some security and DNS services.)\\nPublic CloudSLBVM\\nVM\\nVM\\nVMEnterprise Central Site\\nEnterprise B/O Internet User198.51.100.1 10.1.1.1Static NAT2\\n13\\n4\\nFigure 27-19 Common Baseline Public Cloud Features Running Just One Instance\\nOnce the cloud provider instantiates the VMs, the consumer adds the applications to the \\nVMs, and the users can connect to the public IP address as shown on the left of the figure. The users connect through the Internet (Step 1), to public IP address 198.51.100.1 (Step 2). The static NAT function at the cloud provider (Step 3) translates to the assigned private IPv4 address. Finally, at Step 4, the SLB function load balances each user to one of the VMs.\\nAs shown, all the services provided by the cloud provider are services. The consumer can \\nask for particular types of service, like having a public address, and doing server load bal-ancing. However, as shown here, the consumer does not get access to the cloud router that performs NAT, or the device that performs SLB. The consumer needed a service, the cloud provider offered it, the consumer asked for it. And it works.\\nIn other cases, the consumer may feel the need to be in direct control over some network-\\ning function. For instance, many IT personnel might look at the design in Figure 27-19 and ask: Where is the firewall? Or maybe you want to use VPN services, maybe even DMVPN, terminated at a router. As the consumer, you might want to have a router in your part of the public cloud—not a router service, but a router of your very own, one that you control and configure. In that case, the cloud consumer can use a virtual network function.\\nA virtual network function (VNF) is a virtual instance of a traditional networking device \\nthat the consumer can choose to use in a cloud. For example, cloud providers offer differ-\\nent security services, but in addition, they offer to let consumers run their own firewall in the cloud. Similarly, the cloud provider routes packets and does other typical router func-tions, but if a consumer wants total control of a router, the cloud consumer can run a virtual router as a VM. Any such virtual networking device is a VNF.\\nptg17396363754  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 27-20 shows a common public WAN design for one tenant (consumer) in which the \\nconsumer has chosen to add two VNFs: a virtual firewall and a virtual router. The virtual firewall could be a Cisco    ASAv (that is, the virtual version of Cisco’s ASA firewall), running as a VM. Similarly, the router could be a Cisco router, specifically a Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR), which is a Cisco router with the IOS XE operating system running as a VM. Those devices would be available for the consumer to configure and use just like they would use a physical         version of the same device.\\nConsumer (Tenant) 1\\nVirtual\\nSLB VM\\nVM\\nVMVM\\n198.51.100.1Cloud\\n3URYLGHU·V\\nRouter\\nInternetVirtual\\nFirewallVirtual\\nRouter\\n(ASAv) (CSR)\\nFigure 27-20 Common Virtual Appliances Added by IT Staff\\nThe more you read about emerging network technology in the press, the more you will see \\na variety of terms related to the concept of virtual functions in a network, so it helps to be aware of some of the related terms. For instance, the exam topics refer to the term   virtual \\nnetwork infrastructure, which is a broad term that refers to the fact traditional networking functions like routing, switching, and so on occur in software—that is, it is virtual instead of physical. The term    network functions virtualization (NFV) is a term used primarily in the \\nservice provider space for how SPs virtualize network functions inside their network. (The terms are defined by    ETSI, a European Telco standards body; see http://www.etsi.org.) With NFV, each networking function, like the     CSR router in Figure 27-20, would then be called a VNF.\\nDNS Services\\nMany options exist for DNS services      related to a public cloud. This next topic works through a couple of the common options.\\nFirst, because this book spends only a little time with DNS discussions, review some DNS \\nbasics without cloud, as shown in Figure 27-21. The figure shows what happens with DNS when a user goes to a web page and clicks a link for an app, App1, as shown at the bottom of the page. In this scenario, App1 runs inside the enterprise; that is, it is a traditional app, not running in a private or public cloud.\\nThe action in the figure follows these numbered steps:\\nStep 1. The user clicks the link for App1; the link includes domain name \\napp1.example.com.\\nStep 2. The user’s device sends a DNS request for app1.example.com to the enterprise \\nDNS server.\\nStep 3. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with app1.example.com \\n(10.1.1.1).\\nStep 4. The user connects to App1 at the server that uses address 10.1.1.1.\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   755\\nEnterprise\\nWAN\\n10.1.1.1\\n10.1.1.1\\nApp1 (Link: app1.example.com)\\nApp2 (Link: app2.example.com)App1.example.comCloud Provider\\nApp2.example.comDNS DNS\\n2\\n13\\n4\\nFigure 27-21 DNS Request for Internal Application (App1)\\nNow imagine that the enterprise IT staff migrates a different app, App2, to the public \\ncloud. The public cloud provider wants all its customers to have a good experience, and for the service to work well. So when asking for the new IaaS VMs, the consumer chooses some configuration settings. As a result of those choices, the cloud provider allocates a public IP address (198.51.100.1) for the VMs, dynamically creates a matching name, and adds an address record for the name and address to the cloud provider’s DNS server. The cloud      pro-vider also makes all this same information available to the consumer (hostname, IP address, and so on).\\nGiven those steps, the enterprise can choose to do something simple: just update its own \\nDNS to refer to the public IP address used by its application as running at the public cloud provider. Figure 27-22 shows the user flow after making changes to the enterprise DNS. \\nEnterprise\\nWAN\\n198.51.100.1\\nApp1 (Link: app1.example.com)\\nApp2 (Link: app2.example.com)Cloud Provider\\n198.51.100.1\\nApp2.example.comDNS DNS\\n2\\n13 4A-Record:\\napp2.example.com\\nis 198.51.100.1\\nFigure 27-22 Enterprise DNS Is Updated with Addresses of Public Cloud Apps\\nptg17396363756  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFollowing the steps      in the figure:\\nStep 1. The user clicks the link for App2; the link includes domain name app2.exam-\\nple.com.\\nStep 2. The user’s device sends a DNS request for app2.example.com to the enterprise \\nDNS server.\\nStep 3. The DNS returns the IP address associated with app2.example.com \\n(198.51.100.1).\\nStep 4. The user connects to the app at the server that uses address 198.51.100.1.\\nAs yet another option, the consumer can rely on the DNS service of the cloud provider. The \\ncloud provider automatically creates a DNS record for each VM. In this scenario, the enter-prise DNS still requires a change for name app2.example.com, but instead of an A-record that identifies the IP address, it points to the DNS server of the cloud provider. And user DNS resolution requests flow to the enterprise DNS, and then to the cloud provider’s DNS, and then back again. However, the end result is that the user learns      the same IP address (198.51.100.1 in this case) that is used for the IaaS service. \\nAddress Assignment Services and DHCP\\nCloud providers make a big effort to supply IP addresses to the hosts in the service, and to do that automatically and as simply as possible. They know that any VM defined by a cloud service, public or private, needs an IP address. So rather than make each customer take the time and effort to set up a VNF to run as a DHCP server, and then configure it, the cloud provider lets the consumer specify some criteria for the addresses. For instance, the con-sumer can let the cloud provider choose addresses, or the consumer can specify all the       IP addresses to use. Then the cloud provider sets up the addressing automatically.\\nFirst, consider the case in which the consumer wants the application to be reachable directly \\nover the Internet. The cloud provider can allocate a public IP address. Then, the cloud provider can give each VM a private IP address based on the provider’s private IP address space. As usual, and as seen earlier in Figure 27-19, the cloud provider uses NAT to translate between the public and private addresses. \\nFigure 27-23 shows just such an example. The cloud provider uses network 10.0.0.0 for its \\nprivate addresses, and in this case it allocates addresses from subnet 10.2.2.0/24 to the new VMs for a particular tenant (consumer). Note that the cloud provider may (and probably does) use DHCP behind the scenes, but there is no DHCP server required by the customer as a VNF, and no DHCP configuration required by the customer. The public IP address used for this service uses public IP address 198.51.100.1, which the cloud provider NATs to the correct private address in network 10.0.0.0 on behalf of the customer. As for configura-tion, the customer chooses options from the cloud services catalog, and the provider makes       the addresses match.\\nSubnet 10.2.2.0/24\\nNAT198.51.100.1Consumer3URYLGHU·V\\x03,3\\x036SDFH\\nVM\\nVMVM\\nVM3ULYDWH\\x1d\\n172.16.0.0/16\\nFigure 27-23 Public Cloud Addressing: Cloud Private Addresses for IaaS VMs\\nptg1739636327Chapter 27: Cloud Computing   757\\nOther cloud consumers may want a different network design in the cloud, requiring differ-\\nent IP addresses. For instance, when connecting a private WAN connection, the consumer may want only internal enterprise users to be able to reach the applications running in the cloud. In that case, it would make sense to use private addresses only, and use addresses from the consumer’s IP address space. Those subnets would then be advertised into the rest of the enterprise, just like any other enterprise subnets.\\nFigure 27-24 shows just such an example. In this case, the enterprise creates a VPN connec-\\ntion to the cloud, terminating in a Cisco CSR (running as a VNF). That VPN tunnel’s private addressing uses subnet 172.16.1.0/24 from the consumer’s private IP address space. The VMs created by the cloud provider come from subnet 172.16.2.0/24. The enterprise can then advertise routes for 172.16.2.0/24 throughout the enterprise, so that all users       can reach the cloud-based apps.\\nTenant: 172.16.2.0 /24Tunnel:\\n172.16.1.0  /24Consumer\\nVM\\nVMVM\\nVM172.16.0.0/16Cloud Provider\\nVNF\\n(CSR)\\nFigure 27-24 Public Cloud Addressing: Consumer Private Addresses for IaaS VMs\\nIn the scenarios described with the last two figures, note that the cloud consumer does not run their own       DHCP service as a VNF. Even in this second case, with Figure 27-24, the cloud provider performs the service of assigning the addresses, even with the addresses coming from the consumer’s address space. The consumer just needs to make the correct choices at the cloud services catalog (that is, at the web page or APIs for the cloud pro-vider). \\nNOTE If you find this discussion of IP addressing in public clouds interesting, do a search on the net for “Amazon EC2 Instance IP Addressing.” You should find a link that summa-rizes a lot of the discussion about how Amazon Web Services (AWS) handles public and private addressing along with DNS.\\nNTP\\nTo wrap up the discussion of virtual network functions and services, think back to the topic of Network Time Protocol    (NTP), covered     in the ICND1 half of the CCNA R&S exam. NTP uses the concept of servers that supply time-of-day clock information. NTP clients then receive that information in NTP messages and adjust (synchronize) their clocks to match the server’s time. Over time, the client’s clock should synchronize to have close to the same time as the server.\\nThe VNFs and VMs in a cloud service, whether private or public, often need to synchronize \\ntheir time with the rest of the devices and servers in the enterprise. To do that, the VMs and VNFs can be configured as NTP clients, referencing NTP servers inside the enterprise, as shown in Figure 27-25.\\nptg17396363758  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTenant 1\\nNTP\\nClientsR1Cloud Provider Enterprise\\nSLBFirewallServer:\\nNTP\\n10.1.1.9\\nFigure 27-25 Using the NTP Servers Inside the Enterprise \\nIf a consumer is already using a VNF in the cloud, like a router, it might make more sense \\nto configure that router to act in NTP client/server mode, as shown in Figure 27-26. In this example, a CSR running in the cloud does just that. The CSR first acts as NTP client, syn-chronizing its time with the NTP server inside the enterprise. The CSR also acts as a server     to the VMs and other VNFs used for that consumer (tenant).\\nTenant 1Cloud Provider Enterprise\\nSLBFirewallServer:\\nNTP\\n10.1.1.9 NTP\\nClient/ServerNTP MessagesVM\\nFigure 27-26 Using a Tenant CSR Router as NTP Client/Server\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions.

You understand protocols that the devices use, understand the commands that can customize how those protocols operate, and add distributed configuration to the devices, device by device, to implement the network.\\nNetwork programmability   changes the operational model for networks, requiring new meth-\\nods of controlling the devices to enable the new operational models. The term network programmability itself refers to more focus on software control of the network, so that the network can be changed more easily to adapt to the ever-changing environment as virtual machines (VM) move in a data center, and traffic patterns change, and so forth. The similar term   Software Defined Networking (SDN), used frequently in the trade press, also empha-\\nsizes the concept of software (programmatic) control of the network, rather than the more static configuration-controlled networking.\\nAs with the previous chapter covering cloud computing, this chapter can only begin to \\nintroduce the concepts of network programmability and SDN, because the topic is simply too large. Thankfully, the related exam topics focus on the most fundamental ideas of SDN. The first major section of this chapter introduces the basic concepts mentioned in the exam topics, specifically the data and control planes, along with controllers and the related architecture. The second section then shows three separate product examples of network programmability, all of which use different methods to implement networking features. The last section focuses on one additional feature of the APIC-EM product.\\nptg17396363“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nTake the quiz (either here, or use the PCPT software) if you want to use the score to help \\nyou decide how much time to spend on this chapter.

You have learned about how switches and routers do that forwarding for the entire length of preparing for the CCNA R&S exam. \\nNetwork programmability and SDN takes those ideas, analyzes the pieces, finds ways to \\nimprove them for today’s needs, and reassembles those ideas into a new way of making networks work. At the end of that rearrangement, the devices in the network still forward messages, but the how and why has changed. \\nThis first major section explains the most central concepts of SDN and network program-\\nmability. It starts by breaking down some of the components of what exists in traditional networking devices. Then this section explains how some centralized controller software, called a controller, creates an architecture for easier programmatic control of a network. \\nThe Data, Control, and Management Planes\\nStop and think about what networking devices do. What does a router do? What does a switch do?\\nMany ideas should come to mind. For instance, they physically connect to each other with \\ncables, and with wireless, to create networks. They forward messages: switches forward Ethernet frames, and routers forward packets. They use many different protocols to learn useful information, like routing protocols for learning network layer routes.\\nEverything that networking devices   do can be categorized as being in a particular plane. \\nThis section takes those familiar facts about how networking devices work, and describes the three planes most often used to describe how network programmability works: the data plane, the control plane, and the management plane. \\nThe Data Plane\\nThe term data plane refers to     the tasks that a networking device does to forward a message. In other words, anything to do with receiving data, processing it, and forwarding that same data—whether you call the data a frame, packet, or, more generically, a message—is part of the data plane.\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  763\\nFor example, think about how routers forward IP packets, as shown in Figure 28-1. If you \\nfocus on the Layer 3 logic for a moment, the host sends the packet (Step 1) to its default router, R1. R1 does some processing on the received packet, makes  a forwarding (routing) decision, and forwards the packet (Step 2). Routers R3 and R4 also receive, process, and forward the packet (Steps 3 and 4).\\n1\\nR1R1 R2 R3 SW1\\n4 3 2 1\\nFigure 28-1 Data Plane Processing on Routers: Basics\\nNow broaden your thinking for a moment, and try to think of everything a router or switch might do when receiving, processing, and forwarding a message. Of course, the forwarding decision is part of the logic; in fact, the data plane is often called the  forwarding plane. But \\nthink beyond matching the destination address to a table. For perspective, the following list details some of the more common actions that a networking device does that fit into the data plane:\\n■De-encapsulating and re-encapsulating a packet in a data link frame (routers, Layer 3\\nswitches)\\n■Adding or removing an 802.1Q trunking header (routers and switches)\\n■Matching the destination MAC address to the MAC address table (Layer 2 switches)\\n■Matching the destination IP address to the IP routing table (routers, Layer 3 switches)\\n■Encrypting the data and adding a new IP header (for VPN processing)\\n■Changing the source or destination IP address (for NAT processing)\\n■Discarding a message due to a filter (ACLs, port security)\\nAll the items in the list make up the data plane, because     the data plane includes all actions done per message. \\nThe Control Plane\\nNext, take a moment to ponder the kinds     of information that the data plane needs to know beforehand so that it can work properly. For instance, routers need IP routes in a routing table before the data plane can forward packets. Layer 2 switches need entries in a MAC address table before they can forward Ethernet frames out the one best port to reach the destination. Switches must use Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to limit which interfaces can be used for forwarding so that the data plane works well and does not loop frames forever.\\nFrom one perspective, the information supplied to the data plane controls what the data \\nplane does. For instance, a router with no routes in the routing table cannot forward pack-ets. The data plane is there, but when a router’s data plane tries to match the routing table, and finds no matching route, the router discards the packet. However, once the router has \\nAnswers to the “Do I Know This Already?” quiz:\\n1 A 2 C 3 C 4 A 5 A\\nptg17396363764  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nsome routes, the router’s data plane processes can forward packets. And what controls the \\ncontents of the routing table? Various control plane processes.\\nThe term control plane refers to any action that controls the data plane. Most of these \\nactions have to do with creating the tables used by the data plane, tables like the IP routing table, an IP ARP table, a switch MAC address table, and so on. By adding, removing, and changing entries to the tables used by the data plane, the control plane processes control what the data plane does. You already know many control plane protocols, of course, including all IP routing protocols. \\nTraditional networking protocols and devices separate the control and data planes and dis-\\ntribute those functions into each individual device, as shown in the example in Figure 28-2. In this case, OSPF, the control plane protocol, runs on each router (that is, it is distributed among all the routers). OSPF on each router then adds to, removes from, and changes the IP routing table on each router. Once populated with useful routes, the data plane of the rout-ers, also distributed to each router, can forward incoming packets, as shown from left to right across     the bottom of the figure.\\nData\\nPlaneR1\\nData\\nPlaneR2\\nData\\nPlaneR3\\nControl\\nPlaneControl\\nPlaneControl\\nPlaneOSPF OSPF\\npacket packet packet packet\\nFigure 28-2 Control and Data Planes of Routers—Conceptual\\nThe following list includes many of the more common  control plane protocols:\\n■Routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP)\\n■IPv4 ARP\\n■IPv6 NDP\\n■Switch MAC learning\\n■STP\\nWithout the protocols and activities of the control plane, the data plane of traditional net-working devices would not function well. Routers would be mostly useless without routes learned by a routing protocol. Without learning MAC table entries, a switch could still forward unicasts by flooding them, but doing that for all frames would create much more load on the LAN compared to normal switch operations. So the data plane must rely on the control     plane to provide useful information.\\nThe Management Plane\\nThe control plane does overhead     tasks that directly impact the behavior of the data plane. The management plane does overhead work as well, but that work does not directly impact \\nthe data plane. Instead, the management plane includes protocols that allow network engi-neers to manage the devices.\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  765\\nTelnet and SSH are two of the most obvious management plane protocols. To emphasize \\nthe difference with    control plane protocols, think about two routers: one configured to allow Telnet and SSH into the router, and one that does not. Both could still be running a routing protocol and routing packets, whether or not they support Telnet and SSH.\\nFigure 28-3 lists some of the more common management plane protocols from the CCNA \\nR&S exam. \\nManagement PlaneTelnet, SSH, SNMP, Syslog\\nOSPFControl Plane\\nData PlaneManagement Plane\\nControl Plane\\nData PlaneIPv4 Packets\\nFigure 28-3 Management Plane for Configuration of Control and Data Plane\\nCisco Switch Data Plane Internals\\nTo better understand SDN and network programmability, it helps to think about the inter-nals of switches. This next topic does just that.\\nFrom the very first days of devices called LAN switches, switches had to use special-\\nized hardware to forward frames, because     of the large number of frames per second (fps) required. To get a sense for the volume of frames a switch much be able to forward, consid-er the minimum frame size of an Ethernet frame, the number of ports on a switch, and the speeds of the ports; even low-end switches need to be able to forward millions of frames per second. For example, if a switch manufacturer wanted to figure out how fast their data plane needed to be in a new access layer switch with 24 ports, they might work through this bit of math:\\n■The switch has 24 ports.\\n■Each port runs at 100 Mbps each.\\n■For this analysis, assume frames 125 bytes in length (to make the math easier, because\\neach frame is 1000 bits long).\\n■Use full duplex on all ports, so the switch can expect to receive on all 24 ports at the\\nsame time.\\n■Result: Each port would be receiving 100,000 fps, for 2.4 million fps total, so the switch\\ndata plane would need to be ready to process 2.4 million fps.\\nWhile 2.4 million fps may seem like a lot, the goal here is not to put an absolute number on how fast the data plane of a switch needs to be for any given era of switching technology. Instead, from their first introduction into the marketplace in the mid-1990s, LAN switches needed a faster data plane than a generalized CPU could process in software. As a result, hardware switches have always had specialized hardware to perform data plane processing.\\nFirst, the switching logic occurs not in the CPU with software, but in an   application-\\nspecific integrated circuit (ASIC). An ASIC is a chip built for specific purposes, such as for \\nmessage processing in a networking device. \\nptg17396363766  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSecond, the ASIC needs to perform table lookup in the MAC address table, so for fast table \\nlookup, the switch uses a specialized type of memory to store the equivalent of the MAC address table: ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). TCAM    memory does not require the ASIC to search the table. Instead, the ASIC can feed the fields to be matched, like a MAC address value, into the TCAM, and the TCAM returns the matching table entry, without a need to run a search algorithm. \\nNote that a switch still has a general-purpose CPU and RAM as well, as shown in Figure \\n28-4. IOS runs in the CPU and uses RAM. Most of the control and management plane func-tions run in IOS. The data plane function (and the control plane function of MAC learning) happens     in the ASIC.\\nCPU\\n(IOS)\\nSwitch Data PlaneRAM\\n(Various)\\nASIC\\nLogicTCAM\\nTable Lookup\\nFigure 28-4 Key Internal Processing Points in a Typical Switch\\nNote that some routers also use hardware for data plane functions, for the same kinds of reasons that switches use hardware. (For instance, check out the Cisco Quantum Flow Processor for interesting reading about hardware data plane forwarding in Cisco routers.) The ideas of a hardware data plane in routers are similar to those in switches: use a purpose-built ASIC for the forwarding logic, and TCAM to store the required tables for fast table lookup.  \\nControllers and Network Architecture\\nNew approaches to networking have emerged in the 2010s, approaches that change where some of the control plane functions occur. Many of those approaches move parts of the control plane work into software that runs as a centralized application called   a controller. This next topic looks at controller concepts, and the interfaces to the devices that sit below the controller and to any programs that use the controller.\\nControllers and Centralized Control\\nMost traditional control plane processes use a distributed architecture. That is, the control plane is distributed, running on many devices. For example, each router runs its own OSPF routing protocol process. To do their work, those distributed control plane processes use messages to communicate with each other, like OSPF protocol messages between routers. As a result, traditional networks are said to use a      distributed control plane.\\nThe people who created today’s control plane concepts, like STP, OSPF, EIGRP, and so on, could have chosen to use a   centralized control plane. That is, they could have put the logic in one place, running on one device, or on a server. Then the centralized software could have used protocol messages to learn information from the devices, but with all the processing of the information at a centralized location. But they instead chose a distributed architecture.\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  767\\nThere are pros and cons to using distributed and centralized architectures to do any func-\\ntion in a network. Many control plane functions have a long history of working well with a distributed architecture. However, a centralized application can be easier to write than a distributed application, because the centralized application has all the data gathered into one place. And this emerging world of network programmability and SDN often uses a cen-tralized architecture, with a centralized control plane, with its foundations in a service called a controller.\\nA controller, or SDN controller, centralizes the control   of the networking devices. The \\ndegree to which control is centralized can vary, from the controller performing all control \\nplane functions, to the other end of the spectrum, in which the controller is simply aware of the ongoing work of the distributed control plane.\\nTo better understand the idea of a controller, consider the case shown in Figure 28-5, in \\nwhich one SDN controller centralizes    all important control plane functions. First, the con-troller sits anywhere in the network that has IP reachability to the devices in the network. Each of the network devices still has a data plane. However, note that none of the devices has a control plane. In the variation of SDN as shown in Figure 28-5, the controller (or a program making use of the controller) directly programs the data plane entries into each device’s tables. The networking devices do not populate their forwarding tables with tradi-tional distributed control plane processes.\\nData PlaneController\\nSouthbound\\nInterface (SBI)\\nNetwork Device Network Device Network DevicepacketpacketControl\\nPlane\\nData Plane Data PlaneControl\\nPlaneControl\\nPlane\\npacket packet\\nFigure 28-5 Centralized Control Plane and a Distributed Data Plane\\nFigure 28-5 shows one model for network programmability and SDN, but not all. The figure \\ndoes give us a great backdrop to discuss a few more important basic concepts, in particular, the idea of a Southbound Interface (SBI) and Northbound Interface (NBI).\\nThe Southbound Interface\\nIn a controller-based network architecture, the       controller needs to communicate to the net-working devices. In most network drawings and architecture drawings, those network devic-es typically sit below the controller, as shown in Figure 28-5. There is an interface between the controller and those devices, and given its location in drawings, the interface came to be known as the Southbound Interface, or SBI, as labeled in Figure 28-5.\\nptg17396363768  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE The word “interface” is used throughout this book to refer to physical connectors \\non routers and switches. However, in the context of this chapter’s discussion of SDN, the word “interface” (including in the names of SBI, NBI, and API) refers to software interfaces unless otherwise noted. \\nSeveral different options exist for the SBI. The overall goal is network programmability, so the interface moves away from being only a protocol. An SBI often includes a protocol, so that the controller and devices can communicate, but they often include an application \\nprogramming interface, or API. \\nAn API    is a method for one application (program) to exchange data with another applica-\\ntion. Rearranging the words to describe the idea, an API is an interface to an application program. Programs process data, so an API lets two programs exchange data. While a proto-col exists as a document, often from a standards body, an API often exists as usable code—functions, variables, and data structures—that can be used by one program to communicate and copy structured data between the programs across a network.\\nSo, back to the term SBI: It is an interface between a program (the controller) and a program \\n(on the networking device) that lets the two programs communicate, with one goal being to allow the controller to program the data plane forwarding tables of the networking device.\\nUnsurprisingly, in a network architecture meant to enable network programmability, the \\ncapabilities of the SBIs and their APIs tell us a lot about what that particular architecture can and cannot do. For instance, some controllers may support one or a few SBIs, for a specific purpose, while others may support many more SBIs, allowing choice of SBIs to use. The comparisons of SBIs go far beyond this chapter, but it does help to think about a few; the second major section gives three example architectures that happen to show three      separate SBIs, specifically:\\n■OpenFlow (from   the ONF; https://www.opennetworking.org)\\n■OpFlex (from  Cisco; used with ACI)\\n■CLI (Telnet/SSH) and SNMP (from Cisco; used with APIC-EM)\\nThe Northbound Interface\\nThink about the programming required       at the controller related to the example in Figure 28-5. The figure focuses on the fact that the controller can add entries to the networking device’s forwarding tables. However, how does the controller know what to add? How does it choose? What kind of information would your program need to gather before it could attempt to add something like MAC table entries or IP routes to a network? You might think of these:\\n■A list of all the devices in the network\\n■The capabilities of each devices\\n■The interfaces/ports on each device\\n■The current state of each port\\n■The topology: which devices connect to which, over which interfaces\\n■Device configuration: IP addresses, VLANs, and so on as configured on the devices\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  769\\nA controller does much of the work needed for the control plane in a centralized control \\nmodel. It gathers all sorts of useful information about the network, like the items in the pre-vious list. The controller itself can create a centralized repository of all this useful informa-tion about the network.\\nA controller’s Northbound Interface (NBI) opens the controller so its data and functions can \\nbe used by other programs, enabling network programmability, with much quicker develop-ment. Programs can pull information from the controller, using the controller’s APIs. The NBIs also enable programs to use the controller’s abilities to program flows into the devices using the controller’s SBIs.\\nTo see where the NBI resides, first think about the controller itself. The controller is soft-\\nware, running on some server, which can be a VM or a physical server. An application can run on the same server as the controller, and use an NBI, which is an API, so that two pro-grams can communicate. \\nFigure 28-6 shows just such an example. The big box in the figure represents the system \\nwhere the controller software resides. This particular controller happens to be written in Java, and has a Java-based native API. Anyone—the same vendor as the controller vendor, another company, or even you—can write an app that runs on this same operating system that uses the controller’s Java API. By using that API to exchange data with the controller, the application can learn information about the network. The application can also program flows in the network—that is, ask the controller to add the specific match/action logic (flows) into      the forwarding tables of the networking devices.\\nAPI\\nCodeApp (Java)\\nInside the ControllerJava\\nAPIInformation\\nAPI1 2Flows\\nController Core Functions\\nFigure 28-6 Java API: Java Applications Communicates with Controller\\nNOTE The Northbound Interface (NBI) gets its name from its normal location as shown \\nabove the controller; that is, in what would be north on a map.\\nBefore leaving the topic of NBIs, let me close with a brief explanation of a REST API as used for a controller. REST (Representational State Transfer) describes    a type of API that allows applications to sit on different hosts, using HTTP messages to transfer data over the API. When you see SDN figures like Figure 28-6, with the application running on the same system as the controller, the API does not need to send messages over a network, because both programs run on the same system. But when the application runs on a different system somewhere else in the network other than running on the controller, the API needs a way to send the data back and forth over an IP network, and   RESTful APIs meet that need.\\nptg17396363770  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 28-7 shows the big ideas with a REST API. The application runs on a host at the \\ntop of the figure. In this case, at Step 1, it sends an HTTP GET request to a particular URI. The HTTP GET is like any other HTTP GET, even like those used to retrieve web pages. However, the URI is not for a web page, but rather identifies an object on the controller, typically a data structure that the application needs to learn and then process. For example, the URI might identify an object that is the list of physical interfaces on a specific device along      with the status of each.\\nController APIAPP\\nVariables\\nHTTP GET Response:\\nJSON dataHTTP GET URI1 23\\nFigure 28-7 Process Example of a GET Using a REST API\\nAt Step 2, the controller      sends back an HTTP GET response message with the object. Most REST APIs will ask for and receive structured data. That is, instead of receiving data that is a web page, like a web browser would receive, the response holds variable names and their values, in a format that can be easily used by a program. The common formats for data used for network programmability are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), shown as Step 3. \\nSDN Architecture Summary\\nSDN and network programmability introduce a new way to build networks. The networking devices still exist, and still forward data, but the control plane functions and location can change dramatically. The centralized controller acts as the focal point, so that at least some of the control plane functions move from a distributed model to a centralized model. \\nHowever, the world of network   programmability and SDN includes a wide array of options \\nand solutions. Some options pull most control plane functions into the controller, while others pull only some of those functions into the controller. The next section takes a look at three different options, each of which takes a different approach to network programma-bility and the degree of centralized control.\\nExamples of Network Programmability and SDN\\nThis second of three major sections of the chapter introduces three different SDN and net-work programmability solutions available from Cisco. Others exist as well. These three were chosen because they give a wide range of comparison points:\\n■Open SDN Controller and OpenFlow\\n■Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and OpFlex\\n■Cisco APIC Enterprise Module (APIC-EM)\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  771\\nOpen SDN and OpenFlow\\nOne common form     of SDN comes from the Open Networking Foundation, and is billed as \\nOpen SDN. The ONF (https://www.opennetworking.org) acts as a consortium of users and vendors to help establish SDN in the marketplace. Part of that work defines protocols, SBIs, NBIs, and anything that helps people implement their vision of SDN.\\nThe ONF model of    SDN features OpenFlow as the SBI. Part of OpenFlow defines an \\nIP-based protocol used between the controller and the network devices. Just as important, OpenFlow defines a standard idea of what a switch’s capabilities are, based on the ASICs and TCAMs commonly used in switches today. (That standardized idea of what a switch does is called a switch abstraction.) An OpenFlow switch can act as a Layer 2 switch, a Layer 3 switch, or in different ways and with great flexibility beyond the traditional model of a Layer 2/3 switch.\\nThe Open SDN model centralizes    most control plane functions, with control of the network \\ndone by the controller plus any applications that use the controller’s NBIs. In fact, earlier Figure 28-5, which showed the network devices without a control plane, was meant to represent this mostly centralized ONF model of SDN. The applications may use any APIs (NBIs) supported on the controller platform. However, it calls for OpenFlow as the SBI pro-tocol. Additionally, the networking devices need to be switches that support OpenFlow.\\nBecause the ONF’s Open SDN model has this common thread of a controller with an \\nOpenFlow SBI, the controller plays a big role in the network. The next few pages provide a brief background about two such controllers.\\nThe OpenDaylight Controller\\nFirst, if you were to look back at the     history of OpenFlow, a wide variety of SDN control-lers have been written. Some were more research oriented, while SDN was being developed and was more of an experimental idea. As time passed, more and more vendors began build-ing their own controllers. And those controllers often had many similar features, because they were trying to accomplish many of the same goals. \\nSome companies got together to attempt to create an open source SDN controller, with \\nmany of the same principles of how Linux has been developed over the years. Part of the idea was that if enough vendors worked together on a common open source controller, then all would benefit. All those vendors could then use the open source controller as the basis for their own products, with each vendor focusing on the product differentiation part of the effort, rather than the fundamental features. The result was that back in the mid-2010s, the    OpenDaylight SDN controller (https://www.opendaylight.org) was born.\\nThe OpenDaylight (ODL) project exists as a project of the Linux Foundation. If that fact was not enough to convince you it is legit, OpenDaylight has backing from many vendors, including Cisco. Many of the corporate participants contribute significant money and peo-ple annually.  \\nFigure 28-8 shows a generalized version of the ODL architecture. In particular, note the \\nvariety of SBIs listed in the lower part of the controller box: OpenFlow, NetConf, PCEP, BGP-LS, and OVSDB; many more exist. The ODL project has enough participants so that it includes a large variety of options, including multiple SBIs, not just OpenFlow.\\nptg17396363772  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nYour Java App REST API\\nJava APIBuilt-in App\\nJava APIBuilt-in App\\nJava API\\nCore Features\\nOpenFlow, NetConf, PCEP, BGP-LS, OVSDB\\nNexus 3000 Switches\\nNexus 4500x SwitchesASR 9000 RoutersYour App\\nController\\nCoreNBI\\nSBI\\nFigure 28-8 Architecture of NBI, Controller Internals, and SBI to Network Devices\\nODL has many features, with many SBIs, and many core features. A vendor can then take \\nODL, use the parts that make sense for that vendor, add to it, and create a commercial ODL controller. Just a brief look around the OpenDaylight.org website when writing this chapter in early 2016 showed a listing of 15 commercial SDN     controllers based on ODL, including the Cisco Open SDN Controller, described next.\\nCisco Open SDN Controller\\nCisco has a wide product line, with      a large number of products, many of which support network programmability and SDN. One such product, the Cisco Open SDN Controller (OSC), acts as an SDN controller, and is Cisco’s commercial version of ODL. Cisco follows the intended model for the ODL project: Cisco and others contribute labor and money to the ODL open source project; once a new release is completed, Cisco takes that release and builds new versions of their product. ODL licensing allows any vendor to take the open source code and package it with additional code and support. \\nThe idea of having a free open source product, and a similar commercial product, is not a \\nnew concept in the open source world. In fact, the Linux OS follows that same model: You can download Linux for free to run on your own computer, but companies that use Linux in production may (and often do) want to run a supported and stable commercial version with support available. \\nComparing the two controllers—that is, ODL and OSC—ODL has a longer list of features, \\nbut that is the normal progression of how a vendor would create its own offering. ODL includes many features based on the interests and goals of many participating companies. Each vendor picks the subset it wants to use, test, and support for its own commercial prod-ucts. \\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  773\\nNote that Cisco does support the OpenFlow and ONF model of OpenFlow through OSC \\nand a small part of the Cisco router and switch product line. Cisco customers today (at least at publication) can purchase OSC, and some models of Cisco Nexus switches, plus some Cisco ASR series routers, with the routers and switches supporting OpenFlow. However, Cisco does not appear to be setting about to migrate its entire product line to support OpenFlow, instead taking a different approach to implementing SDN for different parts of a network and for different goals. The next two topics show two such offerings.\\nThe Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure\\nThe ONF Open SDN model with OpenFlow gives the centralized software great power and flexibility by enabling direct programming of the data plane forwarding tables on the devic-es. However, the end goal of that architecture is about enabling software control of the network and how it operates, so that software can automate and change the network based on current conditions in the network. The SDN movement that became OpenFlow meets those goals in particular ways. But SDN with OpenFlow is just one way to enable network programmability and automation.\\nCisco looked at the same set of problems and goals for a modern IT infrastructure, the same \\nissues that drove the development of OpenFlow, and reached some different conclusions about how to go about providing network programmability. One of those solutions focused on the data center, where applications run. So, instead of thinking about the network first, the solution began with applications, and what they need, and then built networking con-cepts around application architectures. Cisco made the network infrastructure        become application centric, hence the name of the Cisco data center SDN solution: Application Centric Infrastructure, or ACI.\\nFor example, Cisco looked at the data center world and saw lots of automation and control. \\nAs discussed in Chapter 27, virtualization software routinely starts, moves, and stops VMs, and cloud software enables self-service highly elastic services. From a networking perspec-tive, some of those VMs need to communicate, but some do not. And those VMs can move based on the needs of the virtualization and cloud systems, so the idea of having a lot of per-physical-interface configuration on switches and routers was just a poor model. \\nThe model that Cisco defines for ACI uses a concept of endpoints and policies. The end-\\npoints are   the VMs (or even traditional servers with the OS running directly on the hard-\\nware). Because several endpoints have the same needs, you group them together into aptly named  endpoint groups. Then policies can  be defined about which endpoint groups can \\ncommunicate with whom—for instance, a group of web servers may need to communicate with a group of application servers. The policy also defines other key parameters, like which endpoint groups can access each other (or not), as well as QoS parameters and other ser-vices. \\nNote that at no point did the previous paragraph talk about which physical switch interfaces \\nshould be assigned to which VLAN, or which ports are in an EtherChannel—the discussion moves to an application-centric view of what happens in the network. Once all the end-points, policies, and related details are defined, the controller can then direct the network as to what needs to be in the forwarding tables to make it all happen—and to more easily react when the VMs start, stop, or move.  \\nptg17396363774  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo make it all work, ACI   uses a centralized controller called the Application Policy \\nInfrastructure Controller (APIC), as shown in Figure 28-9. The name defines the function in this case: It is the controller that creates application policies for the data center infra-structure. The APIC, of course, has a convenient GUI, but the power comes in software control—that is, network programmability. The same virtualization software, or cloud or automation software, even scripts written by the network engineer, can define the endpoint groups, policies, and so on to the APIC. But all these players access the ACI system by interfacing to the APIC; the network       engineer no longer needs to connect to each individual switch and configure CLI commands.\\nVirtualization\\nSoftware\\nCloudSoftware\\nAutomationSoftwareAPIC\\nControllerACI DC with \\nNexus 9000 Switches\\nGUI orScriptsOpFlex\\nSome Control Plane\\nin Switches\\nFigure 28-9 Controlling the ACI Data Center Network Using the APIC\\nACI uses a partially centralized control plane, RESTful and native APIs, and OpFlex as an \\nSBI. The NBIs allow software control from outside the controller. The controller communi-cates with the switches connected to the endpoints, and asks those switches to then create the correct flows to be added to the switches. Interestingly, ACI uses a partially distributed control plane, with the controller informing the switches about the desired policies to apply to each endpoint. The switches still have some control plane software that interprets those       policies to then add the correct flows to the switch’s own forwarding table. \\nFor more information on  Cisco ACI, go to http://www.cisco.com/go/aci.\\nThe Cisco APIC Enterprise Module\\nThe first two solutions discussed in this section move significant parts of the control \\nplane functions into the controller, and require       switches that support that model. The ONF’s Open SDN model centralizes most of the control plane, with switches that support OpenFlow. The Cisco ACI solution centralizes much but not all of the control plane, leav-ing some of the control plane in the switches. However, those switches were newer models of switches with software that supports ACI. Neither the Open SDN model nor the Cisco ACI model uses switches and routers that act like the traditional switch and router discussed throughout this book and the ICND1 book.\\nThe third example of a Cisco SDN solution in this section, called APIC Enterprise Module \\n(APIC-EM), keeps the same traditional switches and routers as discussed throughout this book and the ICND1 Cert Guide. Cisco rejected the idea that its enterprise-wide SDN (net-work programmability) solution could begin with the assumption of replacing all hardware. \\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  775\\nInstead, Cisco looked for ways to add the benefits of network programmability while keep-\\ning the same traditional switches and routers in place. That approach could certainly change over time, but with its initial introduction into the market in late 2015, the Cisco APIC-EM does just that: offer enterprise SDN using the same switches and routers already installed in networks.\\nNOTE Even though APIC-EM uses the same APIC acronym used for the controller with the Cisco ACI offering, the details of how it works differ significantly. \\nPer the Cisco product pages, APIC-EM is the Cisco SDN offering for the enterprise. To help with network programmability, the solution uses a centralized controller. At the same time, it attempts to support much of the more recent generations of Cisco enterprise rout-ers and switches by using SBIs that should sound familiar. Summarizing some of the key points:\\n■The solution uses the APIC-EM controller.\\n■Cisco supplies a variety of applications that reside on the controller, some of which use\\ninformation gathered by the controller, and some of which control the operation of the\\nnetwork devices.\\n■The controller has a RESTful Northbound API that can make available that collected\\ninformation about the entire network over an easy-to-use API.\\n■The control and data planes of the network devices remain unchanged, as part of the\\neffort to support existing devices.\\n■The SBI uses familiar protocols: Telnet, SSH, and SNMP.\\nFigure 28-10 shows a general view of the APIC-EM controller       architecture, with a few of \\nthe APIC-EM apps, the REST API, and a list of the SBIs.\\nTopology\\nVisualizationREST API iWAN Plug n\\nPlayPath\\nTrace\\nCore Features\\nCLI (Telnet, SSH), SNMPYour App\\nAny Topology\\nMany Device ModelsCoreNBI\\nSBIController\\nApps from Cisco\\nFigure 28-10 APIC-EM Controller Model\\nptg17396363776  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe fact that the data plane and control plane do not change needs more explanation. First, \\nAPIC-EM will likely change over time; the Cisco product pages even tell us that support for more SBIs will happen. But as it existed in early 2016 (when this chapter was finalized), when using APIC-EM, all the routers and switches still use their data and control planes in the same way, with no changes. The APIC-EM controller does not program flows into tables, nor ask the control plane in the devices to change how it operates. The switches and routers do not need to be ready to change how they operate internally. So, you might won-der, what does the APIC-EM controller do?\\nFirst, APIC-EM enables easier network automation for customers. To do that, APIC-EM \\ngathers information about the network over the SBI. That information includes topology, devices, interfaces, operational status, and configuration. Next, APIC-EM makes that infor-mation available through extensive NBI APIs. Additionally, APIC-EM makes the data about devices consistent to a great extent, even if the devices use different operating systems. \\nSecond, APIC-EM can still change how the devices operate by changing the configuration \\nof the devices. The SBIs listed in Figure 28-10 include CLI, meaning that APIC-EM can use Telnet and SSH to log in to a device, use the CLI, and issue commands—including to recon-figure the device. With SNMP as the SBI, APIC-EM can also configure the network device with SNMP Set commands. \\nSo in its first version, APIC-EM enables programmability with a centralized controller \\nmodel, without changing the data and control plane concepts and       configuration described throughout this book.\\nComparing the Three Examples\\nThe three example SDN branches in this section of the book were chosen to provide a wide variety for the sake of learning. For instance, with Cisco OSC (using OpenFlow) and with Cisco ACI, the network engineer now works with the controller rather than individual devices. However, they differ to some degree in how much of the control plane work is centralized. Table 28-2 lists those and other comparison points     taken from this section, for easy review and study.\\nTable 28-2  Points of Comparison: Open SDN, ACI, and APIC Enterprise\\nCriteria Open SDN ACI APIC \\nEnterprise\\nChanges how the device control plane works \\nversus traditio nal networkingYe s Ye s No\\nCreates centralized point from which humans and automation control the networkYe s Ye s Ye s\\nDegree to which the architecture centralizes the control plane Mostly Partially N/A\\n1\\nSBIs used OpenFlow OpFlex CLI, SNMP\\nControllers mentioned in this chapter OpenDaylight, Cisco OSCAPIC APIC-EM\\nOrganization that is the primary definer/owner ONF Cisco Cisco\\n1 The control plan remains the same in the networking devices, so in that sense, the control plane is not \\ncentralized at all.\\nptg1739636328Chapter 28: SDN and Network Programmability  777\\nAlso, before leaving these topics, let me offer a few words about learning more about \\nSDN. Cisco DevNet (https://developer.cisco.com), a site    for anyone interested in network programming, has information about all the Cisco SDN solutions in this section. It also has free labs as well. You should definitely set up a free login at Cisco DevNet and check out the content there. Also, I blog about SDN from time to time at one of my blog sites   (http://www.sdnskills.com); look there for posts with recommendations about what to study to learn about SDN.\\nCisco APIC-EM Path Trace ACL Analysis Application\\nThis final section of the chapter was designed to discuss a single exam topic, and only that exam topic, due to some timing challenges. This short section introduces the topic, with a promise of more information to be posted as a PDF on this book’s companion website. Now that I have made you curious, this section first introduces the Path Trace app, then explains more about the ACL Analysis app and the reason why the details are in a free PDF on the website.\\nAPIC-EM Path Trace App\\nThink of the APIC-EM controller   as a set of base features plus a series of applications or apps. The list of supported applications will grow over time. The apps run natively on the controller; that is, they do not run elsewhere in the network but are installed as part of the controller. From a user interface perspective, they appear as just another feature in the user interface, but architecturally, the apps are separate from the base controller, and may even be developed by different groups within Cisco.\\nAPIC-EM supports a variety of apps, and that list will almost certainly expand over time. \\nCurrently, when you download the APIC-EM software, the software includes all the apps built in. All the apps can run. As for licensing, some apps, called basic apps, do not require a license—they are free to use (just like APIC-EM itself). Other apps, called   solution apps, require the purchase of a license for legal use of the app.\\nThe APIC-EM Path Trace app      has been available since version 1.0 of APIC-EM. The idea is \\nsimple, but it is a very powerful and useful tool. This tool predicts what happens in the data plane of the various devices in the network. The process works something like this:\\n1. Before using Path Trace, another APIC-EM app called Discovery discovers the net-\\nwork topology.\\n2. From the Path Trace part of the GUI, the user can type in a source and destination\\naddress of a packet.\\n3. The Path Trace app examines information pulled by APIC-EM from the devices in\\nthe network—the MAC tables, IP routing tables, and other forwarding details in the\\ndevices—to analyze where this imaginary packet would flow if sent in the networkright now.\\n4. The Path Trace GUI displays the path, with notes, overlaid on a map of the network.\\nYou and I could do the same work, but it would be laborious. APIC-EM’s Path Trace app \\ndoes the work with just a few clicks at the user interface.\\nptg17396363778  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nAPIC-EM Path Trace ACL Analysis Tool Timing and Exam Topic\\nThe one exam topic that mentions an APIC-EM app uses a longish phrase: “APIC-EM Path \\nTrace ACL Analysis tool.” This phrase refers to a newer app (not available in version 1.0 or 1.1 of APIC-EM) that takes the work done by      Path Trace a step further.\\nThe ACL Analysis tool app depends on the Path Trace app, but it then extends the func-\\ntion of the Path Trace app. Path Trace by itself does not consider ACLs in its analysis of the forwarding path. That is, Path Trace shows where the packet would be   forwarded based on MAC address tables and IP routing tables, while ignoring whether an ACL might discard the packet. The ACL Analysis app then examines the chosen path as determined by the Path Trace tool (hence the dependency), but it looks for any enabled ACLs. The ACL Analysis tool analyzes and then characterizes (with notes overlaid on the screen) what packets sent from source to destination would be filtered as it travelled along that path.\\nUnfortunately for our publishing process, the APIC-EM ACL Path Trace ACL Analysis tool \\ncreates a small challenge. The app was not available before we needed to send the book out for its first printing. However, the exam topic refers to that specific feature. The timing for the Cisco release of that feature into the APIC-EM product feature happened to be just a little too late for us to use the final version of the released software when writing this section. \\nWhile the timing of the release of the software feature impacted our book schedule, it \\nshould not impact your study schedule. We plan to deliver to you more detail about this one exam topic, as follows:\\n■The book has an Appendix B, “Exam Updates,” that is designed as a tool to add new\\ncontent to the book over time without creating a new edition. (Basically, we create a new\\nversion of Appendix B, post it on the web page, and even email all those who registertheir books at ciscopress.com.)\\n■Once the new APIC-EM version is out with the Path Trace ACL Analysis feature includ-\\ned, I will finish the material, including screen images, so you can see how it works.\\n■You should learn this app by using it on DevNet as well. The updated Appendix B mate-\\nrial will include a link to any specific Cisco DevNet labs about this new feature, but youcan always browse for labs at developer.cisco.com and look for labs that have APIC-EM1.2 installed. (That would be the best way to learn the features of a GUI-based tool any-way.)\\n■If the code is available when      we expect it, our new Appendix B will be sitting there\\non the website by the time you read this. Go look now; look at this book’s currentAppendix B for details about how to download (for free, of course).\\nChapter Review\\nOne key to doing well on the exams is to perform repetitive spaced review sessions. Review \\nthis chapter’s material using either the tools in the book, DVD, or interactive tools for the same material found on the book’s companion website. Refer to the “Your Study Plan” ele-ment for more details. Table 28-3 outlines the key review elements and where you can find them.

The exercise of trying to remember all the terms you remember from those chapters would be useful by itself. Do just that, creating one mind map for each chapter, as listed in Table P7-2. Within each mind map, you may choose any organization you see fit.\\nAppendix E, “Mind Map Solutions,” lists sample mind map answers.

You made it through the book, and now it’s time to finish getting ready \\nfor the exam. This chapter helps you get ready to take and pass the exam in two ways.\\nThis chapter begins by talking about the exam itself. You know the content and topics. \\nNow you need to think about what happens during the exam, and what you need to do in these last few weeks before taking the exam. At this point, everything you do should be focused on getting you ready to pass so that you can finish up this hefty task.\\nThe second section of this chapter gives you some exam review tasks as your final prepara-\\ntion for your ICND1, ICND2, or CCNA exam.\\nAdvice About the Exam Event\\nNow that you have finished the bulk of this book, you could just register for your Cisco ICND1, ICND2, or CCNA R&S exam; show up; and take the exam. However, if you spend a little time thinking about the exam event itself, learning more about the user interface of the real Cisco exams, and the environment at the Pearson VUE testing centers, you will be better prepared, particularly if this is your first Cisco exam. This first of two major sections in this chapter gives some advice about the Cisco exams and the exam event itself.\\nLearn the Question Types Using the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial\\nIn the weeks leading up to    your exam, you should think more about the different types of exam questions and have a plan for how to approach those questions. One of the best ways to learn about the exam questions is to use the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial.\\nTo find the Cisco Certification Exam Tutorial, go to Cisco.com and search for “exam tuto-\\nrial.” The tutorial sits inside a web page with    a Flash presentation of the exam user interface. The tutorial even lets you take control as if you were taking the exam. When using the tuto-rial, make sure that you take control and try the following:\\n■Try to click Next on the multiple-choice, single-answer question without clicking an\\nanswer, and see that the testing software tells you that you have too few answers.\\n■On the multiple-choice, multiple-answer question, select too few answers and click Next\\nto again see how the user interface responds.\\n■In the drag-and-drop question, drag the answers to the obvious answer locations, but\\nthen drag them back to the original location. (You can do this on the real exam if you\\nchange your mind when answering a question.)\\n■On the simulation question, first just make sure that you can get to the command-line\\ninterface (CLI) on one of the routers. To do so, you have to click the PC icon for a PCconnected to the router console; the console cable appears as a dashed line, whereas net-work cables are solid lines.\\nptg17396363■Still on the sim question, make sure that you look at the scroll areas at the top, at the\\nside, and in the terminal emulator window. These scrollbars let you view the entire ques-\\ntion and scenario.\\n■Still on the sim question, make sure that you can toggle between the topology window\\nand the terminal emulator window by clicking Show topology and Hide topology. Hangout here and click around until you are completely comfortable navigating—and do itagain tomorrow and the next day.\\n■On the testlet question, answer one multiple-choice question, move to the second and\\nanswer it, and then move back to the first question, confirming that inside a testlet youcan move around between questions.\\n■Again on the testlet question, click Next to see the pop-up window that Cisco uses as a\\nprompt to ask whether you want to move on. (Testlets might actually allow you to givetoo few answers and still move on, so make extra sure that you answer with the correctnumber of answers in each testlet question.) After you click Next to    move past the test-\\nlet, you cannot go back to change your answer for any of these questions.\\nThink About Your Time Budget Versus Number of Questions\\nOn exam day, you need to keep    an eye on your speed. Going too slowly hurts you because \\nyou might not have time to answer all the questions. Going too fast can be hurtful if you are rushing because you are fearful about running out of time. So, you need to be able to somehow know whether you are moving quickly enough to answer all the questions, while not rushing.\\nThe exam user interface shows some useful information, namely a countdown timer and a \\nquestion counter. The question counter shows a question number for the question you are answering, and it shows the total number of questions on your exam.\\nUnfortunately, some questions require lots more time than others, and for this and other \\nreasons, time estimating can be a challenge.\\nFirst, before you show up to take the exam, you only know a range of the number of ques-\\ntions for the exam; for example, the Cisco website might list the CCNA R&S exam as hav-ing from 50 to 60 questions. But you do not know how many questions are on your exam until the exam begins, when you go through the screens that lead up to the point where you click Start Exam, which starts your timed exam.\\nNext, some questions (call them time burners) clearly take a lot more time to answer:\\nNormal-time questions: Multiple-choice  and drag-and-drop, approximately 1 minute \\neach\\nTime burners: Sims, simlets, and  testlets, approximately 6–8 minutes each\\nFinally, in the count of 50 to 60 questions on a single exam, even though testlet and simlet \\nquestions contain several multiple-choice questions, the exam software counts each testlet and simlet question as one question in the question counter. For example, if a testlet ques-tion has four embedded multiple-choice questions, in the exam software’s question counter, that counts as one question. So when you start the exam, you might see that you will    have 50 questions, but you don’t know how many of those are time burners.\\nptg17396363786  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNOTE Cisco does not tell us why one person taking the exam might get 50 questions \\nwhile someone else taking the same exam might get 60 questions, but it seems reasonable to think that the person with 50 questions might have a few more of the time burners, making the two exams equivalent.\\nYou need a plan for how you will check your time, a plan that does not distract you from the exam. You can ponder the facts listed here and come up with your own plan. If you want a little more guidance, the next topic shows one way to check your time that uses some simple math so it does not take much time away from the test.\\nA Suggested Time-Check Method\\nYou can use the following math   to do your time check in a way that weights the time based on those time-burner questions. You do not have to use this method. But this math uses only addition of whole numbers, to keep it simple. It gives you a pretty close time estimate, in my opinion.\\nThe concept is simple. Just do a simple calculation that estimates the time you should have \\nused so far. Here’s the math:\\nNumber of questions answered so far + 7 per time burner answered so far\\nThen you check the timer to figure out how much time you have spent:\\n■You have used exactly that much time, or a little more time: your timing is perfect.\\n■You have used less time: you are ahead of schedule.\\n■You have used noticeably more time: you are behind schedule.\\nFor example, if you have already finished 17 questions, 2 of which were time burners, your time estimate is 17 + 7 + 7 = 31 minutes. If your actual time is also 31 minutes, or maybe 32 or 33 minutes, you are right on schedule. If you have spent less than 31 minutes, you are ahead of schedule.\\nSo, the math is pretty easy: Questions answered, plus 7 per   time burner, is the guesstimate \\nof how long you should have taken so far if you are right on time.\\nNOTE This math is an estimate; I make no guarantees that the math will be an accurate predictor on every exam.\\nMiscellaneous Pre-Exam Suggestions\\nHere are just a few more suggestions    for things to think about before exam day arrives:\\n■Get some earplugs. Testing centers   often have some, but if you do not want to chance\\nit, come prepared with your own. (They will not let you bring your own noise-canceling\\nheadphones into the room if they follow the rules disallowing any user electronic devic-es in the room, so think low-tech disposable earplugs, or even bring a cotton ball.) Thetesting center is typically one room within a building of a company that does somethingelse as well, often a training center, and almost certainly you will share the room with\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  787\\nother test takers coming and going. So, there are people talking in nearby rooms and \\nother office noises. Earplugs can help.\\n■Some people like to spend the first minute of the exam writing down some notes for ref-\\nerence, before actually starting the exam. For example, maybe you want to write downthe table of magic numbers for finding IPv4 subnet IDs. If you plan to do that, practicemaking those notes. Before each practice exam, transcribe those lists, just like you expectto do at the real exam.\\n■Plan your travel to the testing center with enough time so that you will not be rushing to\\nmake it just in time.\\n■If you tend to be nervous before exams, practice your favorite relaxation techniques for\\na few minutes before each practice exam, just to    be ready to use them.\\nExam-Day Advice\\nI hope the exam goes well for you. Certainly, the better prepared you are, the better chanc-\\nes you have on the exam. But these small tips can   help you do your best on exam day:\\n■Rest the night before the exam rather than stay up late to study. Clarity of thought is\\nmore important than one extra fact, especially because the exam requires so much analy-\\nsis and thinking rather than just remembering facts.\\n■If you did not bring earplugs, ask the testing center for some, even if you cannot imagine\\nusing them. You never know whether using them might help.\\n■You may bring personal effects into the building and testing company’s space, but not\\ninto the actual room in which you take the exam. So, save a little stress and bring as littleextra stuff with you as possible. If you have a safe place to leave briefcases, purses, elec-tronics, and so on, leave them there. However, the testing center should have a place tostore your things as well. Simply put, the less you bring, the less you have to worry aboutstoring. (For example, I have been asked to remove even my analog wristwatch on morethan one occasion.)\\n■The exam center will give you a laminated sheet and pen, as a place to take notes. (Test\\ncenter personnel typically do not let you bring paper and pen into the room, even if sup-plied by the testing center.) I always ask for a second pen as well.\\n■If they’re available, grab a few tissues from the box in the room, for two reasons. One, to\\navoid having to get up in the middle of the exam. Two, if you need to erase your lami-nated sheet, doing that with a tissue paper rather than your hand helps prevent the oilfrom your hand making the pen stop working well.\\n■Leave for the testing center with extra time so that you do not have to rush.\\n■Find a restroom to use before going into the testing center. If you cannot find one, you\\ncan use one in the testing center, and test personnel will direct you and give you timebefore your exam starts.\\n■Do not drink a 64-ounce caffeinated drink on the trip to the testing center. After the\\nexam starts, the exam timer will not stop while you go to the restroom.\\n■On exam day, use any relaxation   techniques that you have practiced to help get your\\nmind focused while you wait for the exam.\\nptg17396363788  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nReserve the Hour After the Exam in Case You Fail\\nSome people pass these exams on the first attempt, and some do not. The exams are not \\neasy. If you fail to pass the exam that day, you will likely be disappointed. And that is understandable. But it is not a reason to give up. In fact, I added this short topic to give you a big advantage in case you do fail.\\nThe most important study hour    for your next exam attempt is the hour just after your failed \\nattempt.\\nPrepare to fail before you take the exam. That is, prepare your schedule to give yourself an \\nhour, or at least a half an hour, immediately after the exam attempt, in case you fail. Then follow these suggestions:\\n■Bring pen and paper, preferably a notebook you can write in if you have to write stand-\\ning up or sitting somewhere inconvenient.\\n■Make sure you know where pen and paper are so that you can take notes immediately\\nafter the exam. Keep these items in your backpack if using the train or bus, or on the car\\nseat in the car.\\n■Install an audio recording app on your phone, and be prepared to start talking into your\\napp when you leave the testing center.\\n■Before the exam, scout the testing center, and plan the place where you will sit and take\\nyour notes, preferably somewhere quiet.\\n■Write down anything in particular that you can recall from any question.\\n■Write down details of questions you know you got right as well, because doing so may\\nhelp trigger a memory of another question.\\n■Draw the figures that you can remember.\\n■Most importantly, write down any tidbit that might have confused you: terms, configura-\\ntion commands, show commands, scenarios, topology drawings, anything.\\n■Take at least three passes at remembering. That is, you will hit a wall where you do not\\nremember more. So, start on your way back to the next place, and then find a place topause and take more notes. And do it again.\\n■When you have sucked your memory dry, take one more pass while thinking of the\\nmajor topics in the book, to see if that triggers    any other memory of a question.\\nOnce collected, you cannot share the information with anyone, because doing so would \\nbreak the Cisco    nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Cisco considers cheating a serious offense and strongly forbids sharing this kind of information publicly. But you can use your infor-mation to study for your next attempt. Remember, anything that uncovers what you do not know is valuable when studying for your next attempt. See the section “Study Suggestions After a Failed Attempt” in this chapter for the rest of the story.\\nExam Review\\nThis Exam Review completes the Study Plan materials as suggested by this book. At this point, you have read the other chapters of the book, and you have done the Chapter Review and Part Review tasks. Now you need to do the final study and review activities before taking the exam, as detailed in this section.\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  789\\nThis section suggests some new activities and repeats some activities that have been previ-\\nously mentioned. However, whether the activities are new or old to you, they all focus on filling in your knowledge gaps, finishing off your skills, and completing the study process. While repeating some tasks you did at Chapter Review and Part Review can help, you need to be ready to take an exam, so the Exam Review asks you to spend a lot of time answering exam questions.\\nThe Exam Review walks you through suggestions for several types of tasks and gives you \\nsome tracking tables for each activity. The main categories are\\n■Taking practice exams\\n■Finding what you do not know well yet (knowledge gaps)\\n■Configuring and verifying functions from the CLI\\n■Repeating the Chapter Review and Part Review tasks\\nTake Practice Exams\\nOne day soon, you    need to pass a real Cisco exam at a Pearson VUE testing center. So, it’s time to practice the real event as much as possible.\\nA practice exam using the Pearson IT Certification Practice Test (PCPT) exam software lets \\nyou experience many of the same issues as when taking a real Cisco exam. The software gives you a number of questions, with a countdown timer shown in the window. After you answer a question, you cannot go back to it (yes, that’s true on Cisco exams). If you run out of time, the questions you did not answer count as incorrect.\\nThe process of taking the timed practice exams helps you prepare in three key ways:\\n■To practice the exam event itself, including time pressure, the need to read carefully, and\\nthe need to concentrate for long periods\\n■To build your analysis and critical thinking skills when examining the network scenario\\nbuilt in to many questions\\n■To discover the gaps in your networking knowledge so that you can study those topics\\nbefore the real exam\\nAs much as possible, treat the practice exam events as if you were taking the real Cisco \\nexam at a VUE testing center. The following list gives some advice on how to make your practice exam more meaningful, rather than just one more thing to do before exam day rolls around:\\n■Set aside 2 hours for taking the 90-minute timed practice exam.\\n■Make a list of what you expect to do for the 10 minutes before the real exam event.\\nThen visualize yourself doing those things. Before taking each practice exam, practice\\nthose final 10 minutes before your exam timer starts. (The earlier section “Exam-DayAdvice” lists some suggestions about what to do in those last 10 minutes.)\\n■You cannot bring anything with you into the VUE exam room, so remove all notes and\\nhelp materials from your work area before taking a practice exam. You can use blankpaper, a pen, and your brain only. Do not use calculators, notes, web browsers, or anyother app on your computer.\\nptg17396363790  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n■Real life can get in the way, but if at all possible, ask anyone around you to leave you\\nalone for the time you will practice. If you must do your practice exam in a distracting\\nenvironment, wear headphones or earplugs to reduce distractions.\\n■Do not guess, hoping to improve your score. Answer only when you have confidence in\\nthe answer. Then, if you get the    question wrong, you can go back and think more aboutthe question in a later study session.\\nPracticing Taking the ICND2 or CCNA R&S Exam\\nThis book comes with both         ICND2 and CCNA R&S practice exams. Depending on which \\nexam you plan to take, you should select a different set of exam databases to use when you want to take a practice exam using the PCPT software. To take an ICND2 practice exam, you need to select one or both of the ICND2 exam databases from PCPT. If you plan to take the CCNA R&S 200-125 exam, select the NA exam databases instead.\\nIf you followed the advice in the “Your Study Plan” guide provided early in this book, you \\nwill not have seen any of the questions in these exam databases before now. After you select the ICND2 or CCNA exam databases, you simply need to choose the Practice Exam \\noption in the upper right and start the exam.\\nYou should plan to take between one and three practice exam with these two exam data-\\nbases. Even people who are already well prepared should do at least one practice exam, just to experience the time pressure and the need for prolonged concentration.\\nTable 29-1 gives you a checklist to record your different practice exam events. Note that \\nrecording both the date and the score is helpful for some other work you will do, so note both. Also, in the Time Notes section, if you finish on time, note how much extra time you    had; if you run out of time, note how many questions you did not have time to answer.\\nTable 29-1 ICND2 Practice Exam Checklist\\nExam Date Score Time Notes\\nICND2/\\nCCNA\\nICND2/\\nCCNA\\nICND2/\\nCCNA\\nAdvice on How to Answer Exam Questions\\nOpen a web browser. Yes, take a break      and open a web browser on any device. Do a quick \\nsearch on a fun topic. Then, before you click a link, get ready to think where your eyes go for the first 5 to 10 seconds after you click the link. Now, click a link and look at the page. Where did your eyes go?\\nInterestingly, web browsers and the content in web pages have trained us all to scan. \\nWeb page designers actually design content expecting certain scan patterns from viewers. Regardless of the pattern, when reading a web page, almost no one reads sequentially, and no one reads entire sentences. People scan for the interesting graphics and the big words, and then scan the space around those noticeable items.\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  791\\nOther parts of our electronic culture have also changed how the average person reads. For \\nexample, many of you grew up using texting and social media, sifting through hundreds or thousands of messages—but each message barely fills an entire sentence. (In fact, that previ-ous sentence would not fit in a tweet, being longer than 140 characters.)\\nThose everyday habits have changed how we all read and think in front of a screen. \\nUnfortunately, those same habits often hurt our scores when taking computer-based exams.\\nIf you scan exam questions like you read web pages, texts, and tweets, you will probably \\nmake some mistakes because you missed a key fact in the question, answer, or exhibits. It helps to start at the beginning and read all the words—a process that is amazingly unnatural for many people today.\\nNOTE I have talked to many college professors, in multiple disciplines, and Cisco Networking Academy instructors, and they consistently tell me that the number-one test-taking issue today is that people do not read the question well enough to understand the details.\\nWhen you are taking the practice exams and answering individual questions, consider these two strategies. First, before the practice exam, think about your own personal strategy for how you will read a question. Make your approach to multiple-choice questions in particu-lar be a conscious decision on your part. Second, if you want some suggestions      on how to read an exam question, use the following strategy:\\nStep 1. Read the question itself, thoroughly, from start to finish.\\nStep 2. Scan any exhibit (usually command output) or figure.Step 3. Scan the answers to look for the types of information. (Numeric? Terms? \\nSingle words? Phrases?)\\nStep 4. Reread the question thoroughly, from start to finish, to make sure that you \\nunderstand it.\\nStep 5. Read each answer thoroughly, while referring to the figure/exhibit as needed. \\nAfter reading each answer, before reading the next answer:\\nA. If correct, select as correct.B. If for sure incorrect, mentally rule it out.C. If unsure, mentally note it as a possible correct answer.\\nNOTE Cisco exams will tell you the number of correct answers. The exam software also \\nhelps you finish the question with the right number of answers noted. For example, the software prevents you from selecting too many answers. Also, if you try to move on to the next question but have too few answers noted, the exam software asks if you truly want to move on. And you should guess the answer when unsure on the actual exam—there is no penalty for guessing.\\nUse the practice exams as a place to practice your approach to reading. Every time you click to the next question, try to read the question following your approach. If you are feeling time pressure, that is the perfect time to keep practicing your approach, to reduce      and elim-inate questions you miss because of scanning the question instead of reading thoroughly.\\nptg17396363792  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTaking Other Practice Exams\\nMany people add other practice exams     and questions other than those that come with this \\nbook. Frankly, using other practice exams in addition to the questions that come with this book can be a good idea, for many reasons. The other exam questions can use different terms in different ways, emphasize different topics, and show different scenarios that make you rethink some topics.\\nNote that Cisco Press does sell products that include additional test questions. The  CCNA \\nICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test product is \\nbasically the publisher’s eBook version of this book. It includes a soft copy of the book, in formats you can read on your computer and on the most common book readers and tablets. The product includes all the content you would normally get with the DVD that comes with the print book, including all the question databases mentioned in this chapter. Additionally, this product includes two more ICND2 exam databases and two more CCNA R&S exam databases.\\nNOTE In addition to getting the extra questions, the Premium Editions have links to every test question, including those in the print book, to the specific section of the book for fur-ther reference.

You probably learned a lot, gained some exam-taking skills, and improved your networking knowledge and skills. But if you go back and look at all the questions you missed, you might be able to find a few small gaps in your knowledge.\\nOne of the hardest things      to find when doing your final exam preparation is to discover \\ngaps in your knowledge and skills. In other words, what topics and skills do you need to know that you do not know? Or what topics do you think you know, but you misunder-stand about some important fact? Finding gaps in your knowledge at this late stage requires more than just your gut feel about your strengths and weaknesses.\\nThis next task uses a feature of PCPT to help you find those gaps. The PCPT software \\ntracks each practice exam you take, remembering your answer for every question, and whether you got it wrong. You can view the results and move back and forth between see-ing the question and seeing the results page. To find gaps in your knowledge, follow these steps:\\nStep 1. Pick and review one of your practice exams.\\nStep 2. Review each incorrect question until you are satisfied that you understand the \\nquestion.\\nStep 3. When finished with your review for a question, mark the question.\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  793\\nStep 4. Review all incorrect questions from your exam until all are marked.\\nStep 5. Move on to the next practice exam.\\nFigure 29-1 shows a sample Question Review page, in which all the questions were \\nanswered incorrectly. The results list a Correct column, with no check mark, meaning that the answer was incorrect.\\nFigure 29-1 PCPT Grading Results Page\\nTo perform the process of reviewing questions and marking them as complete, you can move between this Question Review page and the individual questions. Just double-click a question to move back to that question. From the question, you can click Grade Exam to move back to the grading results and to the Question Review page shown in Figure 29-1. The question      window also shows the place to mark the question, in the upper left, as shown in Figure 29-2.\\nIf you want to come back later to look through the questions you missed from an earlier \\nexam, start at the PCPT home screen. From there, instead of clicking the Start button to start a new exam, click the View Grade History button to see your earlier exam attempts and work through any missed questions.\\nTrack your progress through your gap review in Table 29-2. PCPT lists your previous prac-\\ntice exams by date and score, so it helps to note those values in      the table for comparison to the PCPT menu.\\nptg17396363794  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 29-2 Reviewing a Question, with the Mark Feature in the Upper Left\\nTable 29-2 Tracking Checklist for Gap Review of Practice Exams\\nExam (ICND1, \\nICND2, or CCNA)Original Practice Exam DateOriginal Exam ScoreDate Gap Review Was Completed\\nPractice Hands-On CLI Skills\\nTo do well on sim and simlet questions, you need to be comfortable with many Cisco rout-\\ner and switch commands, and how to use them from a Cisco CLI. As described in the intro-duction to this book, sim questions require you to decide what configuration command(s) need to be configured to fix a problem or to complete a working configuration. Simlet questions require you to answer multiple-choice questions by first using the CLI    to issue show commands to look at the status of routers and switches in a small network.\\nTo be ready for the exam, you need to know the following kinds of information:\\nCLI navigation: Basic CLI mechanics of moving into and out of user, enable, and configu-\\nration modes\\nIndividual configuration: The meaning of the parameters of each configuration command\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  795\\nFeature configuration: The set of configuration commands, both required and optional, \\nfor each feature\\nVerification of configuration: The show commands that directly identify the configura-\\ntion settingsVerification of status: The show commands that list current status values, and the abil-\\nity to decide incorrect configuration or other problem causes of less-than-optimal status values\\nTo help remember and review all this knowledge and skill, you can do the tasks listed in the \\nnext several pages.\\nReview Mind Maps from Part Review\\nDuring Part Review, you created different mind maps with both configuration and verifica-tion commands. To remember the     specific mind maps, flip back to each part’s Part Review section.\\nDo Labs\\nWhatever method you chose for building hands-on CLI skills, take some time to review and do some labs to practice     the commands. At this point, you should have thought about con-figuration quite a bit, whether in a simulator, on real gear, or even just as paper exercises. While it might be impractical to repeat every lab, make it a point to practice any commands and features for which you feel a little unsure about the topics from your review of the mind maps.\\nFirst, make it a point to review labs for the major configuration topics in the chapter as \\nlisted in Table 29-3.\\nTable 29-3 Lab T opic Checklist\\nTopic Chapter Date You Finished Lab Review\\nVLANs 1\\nVLAN trunking 1\\nSTP and RSTP 3\\nLayer 2 EtherChannel, PortFast, and BPDU \\nGuard3\\nVTP 5\\nOSPFv2 8\\nEIGRP 10\\neBGP 12\\nPPP 13\\nMultilink PPP 13\\nPPPoE 15\\nGRE Tunnels 15\\nStandard ACLs 16\\nExtended ACLs 17\\nptg17396363796  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTopic Chapter Date You Finished Lab Review\\nRouter on a Stick 19\\nLayer 3 switching with SVIs 19\\nLayer 3 switching with routed interfaces and L3 \\nEtherChannels19\\nHSRP 20\\nOSPF for IPv6 23\\nEIGRP for IPv6 24\\nIPv6 ACLs 25\\nSNMPv2c and SNMPv3 26\\nIP SLA Echo 26\\nSPAN 26\\nOne great way to practice is to use the    Pearson Network Simulator (the Sim) at \\nhttp://www.pearsonitcertification.com/networksimulator.\\nSecond, use the      Config Checklist app available from the book DVD or companion website. \\nMake sure you remember all the required and optional configuration commands. Third, you should be able to repeat any or all of the Config Labs found on my blog site. When you are truly prepared for the exam, you should be able to do these labs without much reference to your notes. The launch site for all CCNA (ICND2) Config Labs   is http://blog.certskills.com/ccna. From there, navigate to the Hands On > Config Lab category from the site menus.\\nAssess Whether You Are Ready to Pass (and the Fallacy of Exam \\nScores)\\nWhen you take a practice exam with PCPT, PCPT gives you a score, on a scale from 300 to \\n1000. Why? Cisco gives a score of between 300 and 1000 as well. But the similarities end there.\\nWith PCPT, the score     is a basic percentage but expressed as a number from 0 to 1000. For \\nexample, answer 80 percent correct, and the score is 800; get 90 percent correct, and the score is 900. If you start a practice exam and click through it without answering a single question, you get a 0.\\nHowever, Cisco does not score exams in the same way. The following is what we do know \\nabout Cisco exam scoring:\\n■Cisco uses a scoring scale from 300 to 1000.\\n■Cisco tells us that it gives partial credit but provides no further details.\\nSo, what does an 800 or a 900 mean on the actual Cisco exams? Many people think those scores mean 80 percent or 90 percent, but we don’t know. Cisco doesn’t reveal the details of scoring to us. It doesn’t reveal the details of partial credit. It seems reasonable to expect a sim question to be worth more points than a multiple-choice, single-answer question, but we do not know.\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  797\\nThe reason I mention all these facts to you is this:\\nDo not rely too much on your PCPT practice exam scores to assess whether you are \\nready to pass. Those scores are a general indicator, in that if you make a 700 one time and a 900 a week later, you are probably now better prepared. But that 900 on your PCPT practice exam does not mean you will likely make a 900 on the actual exam—because we do not know how Cisco scores the exam.\\nSo, what can you use as a way to assess whether you are ready to pass? Unfortunately, the \\nanswer requires some extra effort, and the answer will not be some nice, convenient number that looks like an exam score. But you can self-assess        your skills as follows:\\n1. When you do take an exam with PCPT, you should understand the terms used in the\\nquestions and answers.\\n2. You should be able to look at the list of key topics from each chapter and explain asentence or two about each topic to a friend.\\n3. You should be able to do subnetting math confidently with 100 percent accuracy atthis point.\\n4. You should be able to do all the Config Labs, or labs of similar challenge level, andget them right consistently.\\n5. For chapters with show commands, you should understand the fields highlighted ingray in the examples spread about the book, and when looking at those examples,you should know which values show configuration settings and which show statusinformation.\\n6. For the key topics that list various troubleshooting root causes, when you reviewthose lists, you should remember and understand the concept behind each item in thelist without needing to look further    at the chapter.\\nStudy Suggestions After Failing to Pass\\nNone of us wants to take and fail any exam, but some of you will. And even if you pass \\nthe ICND2 200-105 or CCNA R&S 200-125 exam on your first try, if you keep going with Cisco certifications, you will probably fail some exams along the way. I mention     failing an exam not to focus on the negative, but to help prepare you for how to pass the next attempt after failing an earlier attempt. This section collects some of the advice I have given to readers over the years who have contacted me after a failed attempt, asking for help about what to do next.\\nThe single most important bit of advice is to change your mindset about Cisco exams. Cisco \\nexams are not like high school or college exams where your failing grade matters. Instead, a Cisco exam is more like an event on the road to completing an impressive major accom-plishment, one that most people have to try a few times to achieve.\\nFor instance, achieving a Cisco certification is more like training to run a marathon in under \\n4 hours. The first time running a marathon, you may not even finish, or you may finish at 4:15 rather than under 4:00. But finishing a marathon in 4:15 means that you have prepared and are getting pretty close to your goal. Or maybe it is more like training to complete an obstacle course (for any American Ninja Warrior fans out there). Maybe you got past the first three obstacles today, but you couldn’t climb over the 14-foot high warped wall. That just means you need to practice on that wall a little more.\\nptg17396363798  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSo change your mindset. You’re a marathon runner looking to improve your time or a Ninja \\nWarrior looking to complete the obstacle course. And you are getting better skills every time you study, which helps you compete in the market.\\nWith that attitude and analogy in mind, the rest of this section lists specific study steps that \\ncan help.\\nFirst, study the notes you took about your failed attempt. (See the earlier section “Reserve \\nthe Hour After the Exam in Case You Fail.”) Do not share that information with others, but use it to study. Before you take the exam again, you should be able to answer every actual exam question you can remember from the last attempt. Even if you never see the exact same question again, you will still get a good return for your effort.\\nSecond, spend more time on activities that uncover your weaknesses. When doing that, you \\nhave to slow down and be more self-aware. For instance, answer practice questions in study mode, and do not guess. Do not click on to the next question, but pause and ask yourself if you are really sure about both the wrong and correct answers. If unsure, fantastic! You just discovered a topic for which to go back and dig in to learn it more deeply. Or when you do a lab, you may refer to your notes without thinking, so now think about it when you turn to your notes because that tells you where you are unsure. That might be a reminder that you have not mastered those commands yet.\\nThird, think about your time spent on the exam. Did you run out of time? Go too fast? Too \\nslow? If too slow, were you slow on subnetting, or sims, or something else? Then make a written plan as to how you will approach time on the next attempt and how you will track time use. And if you ran out of time, practice for the things that slowed you down.\\nFourth, if you failed the CCNA R&S 200-125 exam, reconsider your choice for the one-\\nexam path rather than the two-exam path. Think about the ICND1 topics on the CCNA exam. Did you know those pretty well? If so, you may be ready to pass ICND1 now. That’s another step closer, and then you can focus on the ICND2 exam. (For perspective, the original CCNA Official Cert Guide was 500 pages long. The combined ICND1 and ICND2 \\nbooks have grown to over 1,600 pages of technology chapters, for three times as much con-tent     as the original CCNA exam. It’s just a lot of content.)\\nOther Study Tasks\\nIf you got to this point and still feel    the need to prepare some more, this last topic gives you three suggestions.\\nFirst, the Chapter Review and Part Review sections give you some useful study tasks.Second, use more exam questions from other sources. You can always get more questions in \\nthe Cisco Press Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test products, which include an eBook copy of this book plus additional questions in additional PCPT exam banks. However, you can search the Internet for questions from many sources and review those questions as well.\\nNOTE Some vendors claim to sell practice exams that contain the literal exam questions from the official exam. These exams, called “brain dumps,” are against the Cisco testing policies. Cisco strongly discourages using any such tools for study.\\nptg1739636329Chapter 29: Final Review  799\\nFinally, join in the discussions on the Cisco Learning Network. Try to answer questions \\nasked by other learners; the process of answering makes you think much harder about the topic. When someone posts an answer with which you disagree, think about why and talk about it online. This is a great way to both learn more and build confidence.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nYou have studied quite a bit, worked hard, and sacrificed time and money to be ready for the exam. I hope your exam goes well, that you pass, and that you pass because you really know your stuff and will do well in your IT and networking career.\\nI encourage you to celebrate when you pass and ask advice when you do not. The Cisco \\nLearning Network is a great place to make posts to celebrate and to ask advice for the next time around. I personally would love to hear about your progress through    Twitter (@wendellodom) or my Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/wendellodom).

B. A VLAN is a set of devices in the same Layer 2 broadcast domain. A subnet often\\nincludes the exact same set of devices, but it is a Layer 3 concept. A collision domain\\nrefers to a set of Ethernet devices, but with different rules than VLAN rules for deter-\\nmining which devices are in the same collision domain.\\n2. D. Although a subnet and a VLAN are not equivalent concepts, the devices in one\\nVLAN are typically in the same IP subnet and vice versa.\\n3. B. 802.1Q defines a 4-byte header, inserted after the original frame’s destination and\\nsource MAC address fields. The insertion of this header does not change the originalframe’s source or destination address. The header itself holds a 12-bit VLAN ID field,\\nwhich identifies the VLAN associated with the frame.\\n4. A and C. The dynamic auto setting means that the switch can negotiate trunking, but\\nit can only respond to negotiation messages, and it cannot initiate the negotiation pro-\\ncess. So, the other switch must be configured to trunk or to initiate the negotiation\\nprocess (based on being configured with the dynamic desirable option).\\n5. A and B. The configured VTP setting of VTP transparent mode means that the switch\\ncan configure VLANs, so the VLAN is configured. In addition, the VLAN configura-tion details, including the VLAN name, show up as part of the running-config file.\\n6. B and C. The show interfaces switchport command lists both the administrative and\\noperational status of each port. When a switch considers a port to be trunking, this\\ncommand lists an operational trunking state of “trunk.” The show interfaces trunk\\ncommand lists a set of interfaces: the interfaces that are currently operating as trunks.\\nSo, both these commands identify interfaces that are operational trunks.\\nChapter 2\\n1. A, B. Listening and learning are transitory port states, used only when moving from\\nthe blocking to the forwarding state. Discarding is not an 802.1D STP port state.\\n2. C, D. Listening and learning are transitory port states, used only when moving from\\nthe blocking to the forwarding state. Discarding is not an 802.1D STP port state.\\nForwarding and blocking are stable states.\\n3. C. The smallest numeric bridge ID wins the election.\\n4. B. Nonroot switches forward Hellos received from the root; the root sends these\\nHellos based on the root’s configured Hello timer.\\n5. B, D. RSTP uses port states forwarding, learning, and discarding. Forwarding and\\nlearning perform the same functions as the port states used by traditional 802.1D STP.\\nptg173963636. A, D. With RSTP, an alternate port is an alternate to the root port when a switch’s\\nroot port fails. A backup port takes over for a designated port if the designated port\\nfails.\\n7. D. The PortFast feature allows STP to move a port from blocking to forwarding, with-\\nout going through the interim listening and learning states. STP allows this exception\\nwhen the link is known to have no switch on the other end of the link, removing therisk of a switching loop. BPDU Guard is a common feature to use at the same time as\\nPortFast, because it watches for incoming bridge protocol data units (BPDU), which\\nshould not happen on an access port, and prevents the loops from a rogue switch by\\ndisabling the port.\\nChapter 3\\n1. B, C. You cannot set the system ID part of the bridge ID (BID). However, you canset the priority part of the BID, the first 16 bits, in two ways. One way sets it directly\\n(spanning-tree vlan priority), whereas the other tells the switch to figure out a pri-\\nority setting that either makes the switch root (spanning-tree root primary) or the\\nbackup (spanning-tree root secondary).\\n2. B. Cisco switches use the extended system ID format for BIDs by default, in whichthe priority field is broken down into a base priority value (32,768 in this case) plus\\nthe VLAN ID. The priority of this switch allows it to be capable of being the root\\nswitch, but the command output does not supply enough information to know\\nwhether this switch is currently root.\\n3. A, D. The spanning-tree cost 19 command sets the cost for all VLANs on that inter-\\nface unless the cost is set by a spanning-tree cost command that lists the VLAN ID.\\nThe two commands with a port-cost parameter are incorrect; the correct keyword\\nis simply cost. Finally, Cisco switches choose the default cost based on the current\\nspeed, not the interface’s fastest possible speed. So, this interface, running at 100Mbps, already defaults to the IEEE default cost for 100 Mbps, or 19.\\n4. D. IOS uses the channel-group configuration command to create an EtherChannel.Then, the term etherchannel is used in the show etherchannel command, which\\ndisplays the status of the channel. The output of this show command then names\\nthe channel a PortChannel. The only answer that is not used somewhere in IOS todescribe this multilink channel is Ethernet-Channel.\\n5. A, D. First, regarding the listed MAC address of 1833.9d7b.0e80, the first group of\\nmessages listed at the beginning of the output of the show spanning-tree command\\nlists information about the root switch, not the local switch. Second, the “protocol\\nrstp” near the top of the output positively identifies that the switch is using RSTP, as\\nconfigured with the spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst global configuration command.\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n6. B, D. This question requires that you work through the reasons why a port is listed\\nas a particular type of STP port per the Type column in the output of the show\\nspanning-tree vlan 10 command. To begin, keep in mind that a port must have\\nPortFast enabled to be listed as an edge port. That configuration requires either\\nthe spanning-tree portfast interface subcommand or through setting the switch to\\nuse PortFast as a default with the spanning-tree portfast default global command.\\nAnswer choice A shows a type that includes “edge” and the reason listed has nothing\\nto do with PortFast, so that answer is incorrect.\\nFor the other incorrect answer, C, the trunking status of a port does not impact the\\nSTP Type as listed in the output.\\nAnswer B is correct because any port that is using half duplex, either through negotia-\\ntion or by configuration, is considered to be a shared port, as noted with “Shr” in the\\ntype column. Answer D is correct because if a switch has no reason to make a port actas a shared port, or as an edge port, the switch treats it as a point-to-point port.\\nChapter 5\\n1. B, C. VTP has three modes: server, client, and transparent. Only server and transpar-ent mode switches can be used to configure VLANs; that is, to create the VLAN,\\ndelete the VLAN, and assign a VLAN a name. Client mode switches cannot configure\\nVLANs. Also, there is no such mode as dynamic mode.\\n2. C. When any two switches connect with a trunk, and both use VTP in either client orserver mode, they exchange VTP messages. Then the switch with the lower revisionnumber updates its VLAN configuration database to match the VLAN configuration\\ndatabase with the higher revision number. In this case, with all three switches eventu-\\nally connecting to each other through some path with trunks, the highest revision\\nnumber database will win.\\nThe STP election process has nothing to do with the choices made by VTP.\\n3. A, D. VTP synchronization causes two neighboring VTP server and/or client switches\\nto update the switch with the configuration database that has the lower revision num-ber to use the newer database from the neighbor that has the higher revision number.\\nOnce completed, the show vtp status command on both switches will list the same\\nrevision number. Because both use the same configuration database, both will list the\\nsame information about the “last updater,” which is this command’s method of refer-ring to the VTP server that last changed the configuration.\\nThe two incorrect answers list text that does not occur in the output of the show vtp\\nstatus command.\\n4. A, B. One correct answer shows a vlan command being issued on a VTP client, whichis not allowed. IOS actually rejects the vlan command when issued on a VTP client.\\nThe other correct answer relies on the fact that VTP version 1 (and 2) restricts VTP\\nservers and clients to know of standard range VLANs only (VLANs 1–1005). As aresult, the vlan 2000 command on a VTP server (switch SW1) would also be rejected.\\nAs for the two incorrect answers, the vlan 200 command would be accepted on a\\ntransparent mode switch. On the VTP server, that same vlan 200 command would be\\naccepted, because VLAN ID 200 is inside the range of standard VLAN IDs.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  5\\n5. B, C. The VTP domain name must match on two neighboring VTP switches, or they\\nignore each other’s messages. The domain name is case sensitive, making the answer\\nwith domain name “Fred” be correct. Additionally, switch SW1 does not have a vtp\\npassword command configured per the question stem. If SW2 were to be configuredper the other correct answer, then SW1 would not have a VTP password, SW2 would,and the two switches would ignore each other’s VTP messages. (If configured on one\\nswitch, both must have the same case-sensitive password configured.)\\nAs for the incorrect answers, the VTP version does not have to match on neighboring\\nswitches for them to be able to synchronize. Additionally, two neighboring VTP cli-\\nent mode switches will synchronize, which is what the question asked. Neither could\\nbe used to configure new VLANs, but both would synchronize with the other.\\n6. A, B. The case-sensitive domain names must be equal, and the case-sensitive pass-words must be equal. The switches must also connect using a trunk before VTP willwork. It is normal to have some switches as servers and some as clients. A mismatched\\npruning configuration setting does not prevent the synchronization of VLAN data-\\nbases.\\nChapter 6\\n1. D. Of the four answers, the answer “translator” is not an 802.1x role, but the otherthree are 802.1x roles. The device that is connecting to the network and would like\\nto gain access is the supplicant. The AAA server that can check its list of usernames\\nand passwords is called the authentication server. The switch, which does in some waytranslate between message formats for this process, plays the role that 802.1x defines\\nas authenticator.\\n2. C. TACACS+, defined by Cisco, uses TCP as its transport protocol. Cisco defines\\nTACACS+ with an ability to authorize users for different subsets of CLI commands,\\nwhereas RADIUS does not. Both RADIUS and TACACS+ encrypt the passwords\\nbefore transmitting them.\\n3. A, C. DHCP snooping must be implemented on a device that does Layer 2 switching.\\nThe DHCP snooping function needs to examine DHCP messages that flow betweendevices within the same broadcast domain (VLAN). Layer 2 switches perform that\\nfunction, as well as multilayer switches. Because a router performs only Layer 3 for-\\nwarding (that is, routing), and does not forward messages between devices in the sameVLAN, a router does not provide a good platform to implement DHCP snooping (and\\nis not even a feature of Cisco IOS on routers).\\n4. B, C. Switch ports connected to IT-controlled devices from which DHCP messages\\nmay be received should be trusted by the DHCP snooping function. Those devices\\ninclude IT-controlled DHCP servers and IT-controlled routers and switches. Alldevices that are expected to be DHCP client devices (like PCs) are then treated as\\nuntrusted, because DHCP snooping cannot know beforehand from which ports a\\nDHCP-based attack will be launched. In this case, the ports connected to all three PCswill be treated as untrusted by DHCP snooping.\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n5. C. A switch stack connects the switches with stacking modules and stacking cables\\nso that they can communicate directly. Functionally, the switches in the stack act as\\na single logical switch. For instance, to manage the switches in the stack, an engineer\\nwould log in to one switch, with one IP address, and see one configuration file for\\nthe whole switch stack; STP and VTP would run for the logical switch as a whole; andframe forwarding would occur on one switch, forwarding on all ports in the stack.\\nChapter 7\\n1. D. Both versions of RIP use distance vector logic, and EIGRP uses a different kind oflogic, characterized either as advanced distance vector or a balanced hybrid.\\n2. C, D. Both versions of RIP use the same hop-count metric, neither of which is affect-\\ned by link bandwidth. EIGRP’s metric, by default, is calculated based on bandwidth\\nand delay. OSPF’s metric is a sum of outgoing interfaces costs, with those costs (by\\ndefault) based on interface bandwidth.\\n3. B, C, D. Of the listed routing protocols, only the old RIP Version 1 (RIP-1) protocol\\ndoes not support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM).\\n4. C. LSAs contain topology information that is useful in calculating routes, but the\\nLSAs do not directly list the route that a router should add to its routing table. In thiscase, R1 would run a calculation called the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, against\\nthe LSAs, to determine what IP routes to add to the IP routing table.\\n5. B. Neighboring OSPF routers that complete the database exchange are considered\\nfully adjacent and rest in a full neighbor state. The up/up and final states are not\\nOSPF states at all. The 2-way state is either an interim state or a stable state between\\nsome routers on the same VLAN.\\n6. C. The correct answer is the one advantage of using a single-area design. The three\\nwrong answers are advantages of using a multiarea design, with all reasons being much\\nmore important with a larger internetwork.\\nChapter 8\\n1. B. The network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0 command works, because it matches\\nall interfaces whose first octet is 10. The rest of the commands match as follows: all\\naddresses that end with 0.0.0 (wildcard mask 255.0.0.0); all addresses that begin with\\n10.0.0 (wildcard mask 0.0.0.255); and all addresses that begin with 10.0 (wildcardmask 0.0.255.255).\\n2. A. The network 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 command matches all IP address-es that begin with 10.1, enabling OSPF in area 0 on all interfaces. The answer with\\nwildcard mask 0.255.255.0 is illegal, because it represents more than one string of\\nbinary 0s separated by binary 1s. The answer with x’s is syntactically incorrect. The\\nanswer with wildcard mask 255.0.0.0 means “Match all addresses whose last three\\noctets are 0.0.0,” so none of the three interfaces are matched.\\n3. A, E. Of the three wrong answers, two are real commands that simply do not list\\nthe OSPF neighbors. show ip ospf interface brief lists interfaces on which OSPF is\\nenabled, but does not list neighbors. show ip interface lists IPv4 details about inter-faces, but none related to OSPF. One incorrect answer, show ip neighbor, is not a\\nvalid IOS command.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  7\\n4. C. An ABR, by definition, connects to the backbone area plus one or more nonback-\\nbone areas. To do so, the configuration enables OSPF so that at least one interface isin area 0 (backbone) and at least one interface is in some other area. For the incorrect\\nanswers, the abr enable command is imaginary. Routers internal to a nonbackbone\\narea (which are therefore not ABRs) use OSPF network commands that all refer to thesame nonbackbone area. Finally, two routers cannot become OSPF neighbors on a\\nlink if their interfaces are in different areas.\\n5. D. The BDR designation on this line is for backup designated router (BDR). On this\\ncommand, this notation means that the neighbor (2.2.2.2) is the BDR, not the local\\nrouter on which the command was issued (R1 in this case).\\n6. B. With OSPFv2 interface configuration mode, the configuration looks just like the\\ntraditional configuration, with a couple of exceptions. The network router subcom-\\nmand is no longer required. Instead, each interface on which OSPF should be enabled\\nis configured with an ip ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommand. This\\ncommand refers to the OSPF routing process that should be enabled on the interface,and specifies the OSPFv2 area.\\n7. B. SPF calculates the cost of a route as the sum of the OSPF interface costs for alloutgoing interfaces in the route. The interface cost can be set directly ( ip ospf cost),\\nor IOS uses a default based on the reference bandwidth and the interface bandwidth.\\nOf the listed answers, delay is the only setting that does not influence OSPFv2 metric\\ncalculations.\\nChapter 9\\n1. D. Split horizon causes a router to not advertise a route out of the same interface on\\nwhich the router was learned. It also causes the router to not advertise about the con-\\nnected route on an interface in updates sent out that interface.\\n2. D. Route poisoning means advertising the failed route with an “infinite” metric, asopposed to simply ceasing to advertise the route. Of the incorrect answers, SPF\\ndefines how link-state protocols calculate and choose routes; DUAL defines howEIGRP does some of its processing to find replacement routes; and split horizon lim-\\nits which routes a router advertises to help avoid routing loops.\\n3. A. EIGRP separates the function of monitoring neighbor state into the Hello mes-\\nsage process, relying on the receipt of a Hello message. If a router does not receive\\nan EIGRP Hello within the configured EIGRP hold time, the local router believes the\\nneighbor has failed.\\n4. A, B. EIGRP uses bandwidth and delay by default. Load and reliability can be addedto the mix with configuration, but Cisco recommends against adding these to the met-ric calculation.\\n5. B. The feasible distance (FD) is, for all known routes to reach a subnet, the metric for\\nthe best of those routes. The best route is called the successor route, and it is added\\nto the IP routing table.\\n6. C. A route’s reported distance (RD) is the metric used by the neighbor that advertisedthe route. A router uses it to determine which routes meet the feasibility conditionfor whether the route can be a feasible successor route.\\nptg173963638  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 10\\n1. A, C. The EIGRP network command supports a parameter of a classful network,\\nenabling EIGRP on all interfaces in that classful network or an address and wildcard\\nmask. In the latter case, interface IP addresses that match the configured address,\\nwhen applying ACL-like logic with the wildcard mask, match the command.\\n2. C, D. The EIGRP network 10.0.0.2 0.0.0.0 command exactly matches the interfacewith address 10.0.0.2 because of the wildcard mask, enabling EIGRP on that interface.The EIGRP ASN value must match on both routers. The network 10.0.0.1 0.0.0.0\\ncommand exactly matches the address on R1, but the network command needs to\\nmatch addresses on the local router, and these commands should exist on Router R2.The network 10 command is syntactically incorrect; the entire classful network must\\nbe configured.\\n3. D. RIP uses R, and OSPF uses O, but EIGRP uses D. The letter E was already in useby an old (and no longer used) routing protocol, so Cisco chose to use nearby letter D\\nfor EIGRP.\\n4. C. The output from the show ip eigrp neighbors command lists EIGRP neighbors.The command lists only routers that have passed all EIGRP neighbor checks. The\\nAddress column identifies the neighbor based on the neighbor’s interface IP addresson their common link, not based on the neighbor’s EIGRP router ID.\\n5. C. The first number in parentheses is the computed metric for a route, and the secondnumber is the reported distance (RD) for the route. The route through 10.1.6.3 is the\\nsuccessor route, because the first number in parentheses on this line matches the fea-\\nsible distance (FD) on the first line. For the other two routes, only the third route’sRD is less than the feasible distance (the metric of the successor route), making this\\nroute, with next-hop address 10.1.5.4, a feasible successor route.\\n6. A. By definition, the successor route is the best route to reach a subnet, and is the oneroute EIGRP always puts in the IP routing table. So, the show ip route eigrp com-\\nmand lists this route, including the metric. The show ip eigrp topology command\\nlists both successor and feasible successor routes, including their metrics. The show\\nip eigrp interfaces command does not list route information, and the show ip eigrp\\ndatabase command is not a valid IOS command.\\n7. B. The unequal-cost load-balancing features allow IOS to place multiple unequal-cost\\nroutes into the routing table. The restrictions are that the metric must be less than or\\nequal to variance times the feasible distance (5 times 100 in this case), so three of theroutes meet this requirement, ruling out the route with metric 550. This feature also\\nallows only successor and feasible successor routes, ruling out the route with metric\\n450. Of the two routes that meet both requirements, the route with metric 350 has\\nthe highest metric, as requested in the question text.\\nChapter 12\\n1. B, D. The word multihomed refers to designs in which the enterprise connects to (at\\nleast) two ISPs. The two choices that include the term homed refer to designs that\\nconnect to a single ISP.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  9\\n2. C. External BGP, or eBGP, refers to BGP as used between two autonomous systems\\n(as identified by using different autonomous system numbers). Both Interior BGP(iBGP) and eBGP use TCP. Only iBGP connects to other routers in the same ASN.\\nThe one answer that describes what eBGP does, but that iBGP does not, is that eBGP\\nexchanges routes between an enterprise and an ISP, the two of which use differentASNs.\\n3. B, D. The enterprise typically advertises its public IPv4 address block to the ISP.\\nThere is no need to advertise its private IP address block, because Internet routers\\nwill not route packets to private IPv4 networks anyway. As for default routes, the\\nenterprise can benefit from using a default route as advertised by the ISP, but not vice\\nversa.\\n4. A. For this scenario, each router would need a neighbor ip-address remote-as asn\\nBGP subcommand, but no other neighbor commands. For example, if using ASNs 1and 2, and link IP addresses 1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.2, respectively, the configuration would\\nbe, on R1:\\nrouter bgp 1\\n neighbor 1.1.1.2 remote-as 2\\nAnd on R2:\\nrouter bgp 2 neighbor 1.1.1.1 remote-as 1\\n5. D. To cause the injection of a route from the IP routing table to the BGP table,\\nthe network command must match a route in the IP routing table, unless the\\nauto-summary command has also been added to the configuration. One answer listsprefix 200.1.1.0, but mask 255.255.255.0, and both must match the IP route—andthe mask does not match. Likewise, the command with subnet 200.1.1.0 and mask\\n255.255.255.240 does not match any of the routes, either. The network 200.1.1.0\\ncommand implies the default mask—a Class C default mask of 255.255.255.0 in this\\ncase—and again does not match any of the routes in the routing table.\\nNote that the commands that would match routes in this router’s routing table include\\nnetwork 200.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.224, which matches connected subnet\\n200.1.1.0/27, and network 200.1.1.32 mask 255.255.255.240, which matches the\\none OSPF-learned route.\\n6. A, D. The one BGP peer listed on R1, 1.1.1.1, is an eBGP peer. The line that lists\\n1.1.1.1 also lists the peer’s ASN (201). The first line of output lists R1’s ASN (101), so\\nwith different ASNs, the peer is an eBGP peer.\\nThe line that lists the peer (1.1.1.1) basically relists the information in the neighbor\\n1.1.1.1 remote-as 201 command in two of the first three items in that line.\\nThe state of this peer is established, which is the final BGP state, after the TCP con-\\nnection is established and the BGP peers have agreed that their parameters match and\\nthey can exchange routes. The state is known by virtue of a number being listed onthe far right in the “State/PfxRcd” column. That same column lists 1, meaning R1 hasreceived or learned one prefix from this peer—not that R1 has sent one prefix to thispeer.\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 13\\n1. B. The four-wire circuit cable supplied by the telco connects to the device acting as\\nthe CSU/DSU. That can be an external CSU/DSU or a CSU/DSU integrated into a\\nrouter serial interface card. LAN switches do not have serial interfaces, and router\\nserial interfaces do not have transceivers.\\n2. A, C. The encapsulation hdlc command sets the interface encapsulation (data-link protocol) to HDLC. In addition, because Cisco routers default to use theCisco-proprietary HDLC on serial interfaces, removing the use of PPP with the no\\nencapsulation ppp command also works. The other two answers list commands that\\ndo not exist in IOS.\\n3. C. Of the possible answers, only PAP and CHAP are PPP authentication protocols.PAP sends the password as clear text between the two devices.\\n4. A, D. Both routers need an encapsulation ppp command, and both also need IPaddresses before the ping will work. R1 does not need a clock rate command because\\nR2 is connected to the DCE cable.\\n5. B, D. The output lists encapsulation PPP, meaning that it is configured to use PPP.\\nThe line and protocol status are both up, LCP is open, and both CDPCP and IPCP areopen, meaning that IP and CDP packets can be sent over the link.\\n6. A, E. Both the multilink interface and each of the serial interfaces need theencapsulation ppp and ppp multilink commands, which account for both of the\\ncorrect answers to this question. Two of the three incorrect answers list a commandrelated to a Layer 3 feature (ip address and ip ospf), which are useful, but would beused in multilink interface mode instead of serial interface configuration mode. The\\nother incorrect answer lists ppp authentication chap, which would not be used on the\\nLayer 3 multilink interface, but instead on the serial interfaces.\\n7. C, D. The question states a problem symptom with an interface state of line status up,and protocol status down. One incorrect answer refers to a physical layer problem,which usually results in a line status (first status code) value of down. Another incor-\\nrect answer mentions an IP address mismatch on the ends of a link; this mistake allows\\nboth the line and protocol status of the interface to reach an up state. The two correct\\nanswers result in the router having a line status of up, but a protocol status of down.\\nChapter 14\\n1. B, C. A Metro Ethernet E-Tree service uses a rooted point-to-multipoint EthernetVirtual Connection (EVC), which means that one site connected to the service (the root)\\ncan communicate directly with each of the remote (leaf) sites. However, the leaf sites\\ncannot send frames directly to each other; they can only send frames to the root site.Topology design like this that allow some but not all pairs of devices in the group to\\ncommunicate is called a partial mesh, or hub and spoke, or in some cases a multipoint\\nor point-to-multipoint topology.\\nOf the incorrect answers, the full mesh term refers to topology designs in which each\\npair in the group can send data directly to each other, which is typical of a MetroE\\nE-LAN service. The term point-to-point refers to topologies with only two nodes inthe design, and they can send directly to each other, typical of a MetroE E-Line ser-vice.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  11\\n2. A. Metro Ethernet uses Ethernet access links of various types. Time-division multi-\\nplexing (TDM) links such as serial links, even higher-speed links like T3 and E3, donot use Ethernet protocols, and are less likely to be used. MPLS is a WAN technol-\\nogy that creates a Layer 3 service.\\nTwo answers refer to Ethernet standards usable as the physical access link for a Metro\\nEthernet service. However, 100Base-T supports cable lengths of only 100 meters, so\\nit is less likely to be used as a Metro Ethernet access link in comparison to 100Base-LX10, which supports lengths of 10 km.\\n3. A, D. An E-LAN service is one in which the Metro Ethernet service acts as if theWAN were a single Ethernet switch, so that each device can communicate directly to\\nevery other device. As a result, the routers sit in the same subnet. With one headquar-\\nters router and ten remote sites, each router will have ten EIGRP neighbors.\\n4. B, C. A Layer 3 MPLS VPN creates an IP service with a different subnet on eachaccess link. With one headquarters router and ten remote sites, 11 access links exist,\\nso 11 subnets are used.\\nAs for the EIGRP neighbor relationships, each enterprise router has a neighbor rela-tionship with the MPLS provider edge (PE) router, but not with any of the otherenterprise (customer edge) routers. So each remote site router would have only one\\nEIGRP neighbor relationship.\\n5. D. Architecturally, MPLS allows for a wide variety of access technologies. Those\\ninclude TDM (that is, serial links), Frame Relay, ATM, Metro Ethernet, and traditional\\nInternet access technologies such as DSL and cable.\\n6. A. The PE-CE link is the link between the customer edge (CE) router and the MPLSprovider’s provider edge (PE) router. When using OSPF, that link will be configuredto be in some area. OSPF design allows for that link to be in the backbone area, or\\nnot, through the use of the OSPF super backbone, which exists between all the PE\\nrouters.\\nChapter 15\\n1. A. The term client VPN typically refers to a VPN for which one endpoint is a user\\ndevice, such as a phone, tablet, or PC. In those cases, SSL is the more likely protocol\\nto use. SSL is included in browsers, and is commonly used to connect securely to\\nwebsites. GRE along with IPsec is more likely to be used to create a site-to-site VPNconnection. Similarly, Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) could also use IPsec, but\\nin a multipoint topology, and not specifically for client devices.\\n2. A. GRE tunnels that use private IP addresses on the tunnel and then use the Internetbetween the two routers need to configure references to both the private and public\\nIP addresses. First, each router’s tunnel interface has an ip address command that\\nrefers to the local router’s private IP address. Additionally, each router configures a\\ntunnel destination and tunnel source that refer to the public IP address of the other\\nrouter (tunnel destination) and the local router (tunnel source).\\nptg1739636312  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTwo answers refer to Router A’s private address. Per the first paragraph of this expla-\\nnation, that address would be configured on a tunnel interface with an ip address \\ncommand, on Router A, making one of those two answers correct. Private addresses \\nwould not be configured as the tunnel source or destination, making the other answer \\nthat mentions Router A’s private address incorrect.\\nTwo answers refer to Router B’s public address. Per the first paragraph of this expla-\\nnation, that address would only be configured as a tunnel source or tunnel destina-tion, and not with the ip address command. That fact makes one of the answers \\nincorrect. Next, Router B’s public IP address would be listed as the tunnel source on \\nRouter B, and the tunnel destination on Router A. The final (incorrect) answer sug-\\ngests that Router B’s public address would be configured as the tunnel source, but on \\nRouter A, which would be an incorrect setting.\\n3. C. To justify the correct answer: R1’s source address for the tunnel must be an address\\non R1, on an interface in an up/up state, or the tunnel will fail to an up/down state.\\nFor the two answers that mention ping, GRE tunnels do local checks to determine the\\ninterface status, but they do not check connectivity with pings. So, a tunnel interface\\ncan reach an up/up state even though a ping to the destination of the tunnel would\\ncurrently fail. (The router must have a route for forwarding packets to the destination;just no guarantee that the packet would arrive.) In this case, R1 would have a route\\nthat matches destination 2.2.2.2, R2 would have a route that matches 1.1.1.1, and the\\ntunnel interface could be up/up even though a ping would currently fail for other rea-\\nsons.\\nFinally, for the tunnel to work correctly, and forward traffic, R2 would need a work-\\ning interface with address 2.2.2.2. However, R1’s tunnel interface state is independent\\nfrom whether R2’s interfaces are currently up or down.\\n4. B. DMVPN uses multipoint GRE tunnels, which means the hub router requires only asingle tunnel interface. DMVPN allows designs for which the packets going from one\\nspoke site to another route through the hub site, but it also allows for spoke-to-spoketraffic. In any case, packet forwarding between all the sites is allowed.\\n5. C. With PPPoE, the physical interface disables Layer 3 processing with the no ipaddress command. A dialer interface is used as the Layer 3 interface. For address\\nassignment, the ISP typically uses PPP’s IP Control Protocol (IPCP) to assign the\\naddress to the customer router; to enable that function on the customer router, usethe ip address negotiated command. Note that the ip address dhcp command is a\\nvalid command if using DHCP to assign the IP address to the router.\\n6. B, D. The show pppoe session command lists many key facts about a current PPPoE\\nsession. As for the correct answers, the State of UP on the far right confirms that\\nthe PPPoE session is working correctly. Also, the listing of the Di1 (Dialer1) and Vi1\\n(Virtual-access 1) interfaces implies that the two interfaces are bound by the PPPoEsession.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  13\\nAs for the incorrect answers, MAC 0200.0000.3333 is in use, but by the ISP router. \\nThe heading lines list RemMAC (Remote MAC) above and LocMAC (Local MAC) \\nbelow, so it is the lower of the two MAC addresses (0200.0000.3003) that is used by \\nthe local router, R1. Also, the PPPoE configuration is added to the dialer interface \\nand the physical interface (G0/0 in this case), but the virtual-access interface is not directly configured. Instead, IOS generates its configuration from the configuration \\nlisted under the dialer interface.\\n7. A. The show pppoe session command lists a short group of messages about eachPPPoE session once the router is trying to establish that session. However, a router\\ndoes not even attempt to start a PPPoE session until PPPoE has been enabled on thephysical interface using the pppoe enable command. (Note that the pppoe-client\\ndial-pool-number number interface subcommand on the physical interface causes\\nIOS to automatically add the pppoe enable command as well.) Until these commandsare added, the router makes no attempt to create a PPPoE session, and as a result, the\\nshow pppoe session command lists no output at all.\\nFor the incorrect answers, if the dialer interface’s commands related to PPP were\\nincorrect or missing, there might be a problem, but those problems would not result\\nin no output at all from the show pppoe session command. Instead the command\\nwould list some status messages. Similarly, any errors in the configuration related toIP address learning would not prevent the show pppoe session command from listing\\noutput. Finally, the virtual-access interface does not have any specific configuration;its configuration is generated by the router.\\nChapter 16\\n1. A and C. Standard ACLs check the source IP address. The address range 10.1.1.1–\\n10.1.1.4 can be matched by an ACL, but it requires multiple access-list commands.\\nMatching all hosts in Barney’s subnet can be accomplished with the access-list 1\\npermit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 command.\\n2. A and D. The range of valid ACL numbers for standard numbered IP ACLs is 1–99\\nand 1300–1999, inclusive.\\n3. D. 0.0.0.255 matches all packets that have the same first three octets. This is useful\\nwhen you want to match a subnet in which the subnet part comprises the first threeoctets, as in this case.\\n4. E. 0.0.15.255 matches all packets with the same first 20 bits. This is useful when you\\nwant to match a subnet in which the subnet part comprises the first 20 bits, as in this\\ncase.\\n5. A. The router always searches the ACL statements in order, and stops trying to match\\nACL statements after a statement is matched. In other words, it uses first-match logic.\\nA packet with source IP address 1.1.1.1 would match any of the three explicitly con-\\nfigured commands described in the question. As a result, the first statement will be\\nused.\\nptg1739636314  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n6. B. One wrong answer, with wildcard mask 0.0.255.0, matches all packets that begin\\nwith 172.16, with a 5 in the last octet. One wrong answer matches only specific IP\\naddress 172.16.5.0. One wrong answer uses a wildcard mask of 0.0.0.128, which has\\nonly one wildcard bit (in binary), and happens to only match addresses 172.16.5.0\\nand 172.16.5.128. The correct answer matches the range of addresses 172.16.4.0–172.16.5.255.\\nChapter 17\\n1. E and F. Extended ACLs can look at the Layer 3 (IP) and Layer 4 (TCP, UDP) headers\\nand a few others, but not any application layer information. Named extended ACLs\\ncan look for the same fields as numbered extended ACLs.\\n2. A and E. The correct range of ACL numbers for extended IP access lists is 100 to 199\\nand 2000 to 2699. The answers that list the eq www parameter after 10.1.1.1 match\\nthe source port number, and the packets are going toward the web server, not awayfrom it.\\n3. E. Because the packet is going toward any web client, you need to check for the web\\nserver’s port number as a source port. The client IP address range is not specified in\\nthe question, but the servers are, so the source address beginning with 172.16.5 is the\\ncorrect answer.\\n4. A and C. Before IOS 12.3, numbered ACLs must be removed and then reconfigured\\nto remove a line from the ACL. As of IOS 12.3, you can also use ACL configuration\\nmode and sequence numbers to delete one ACL line at a time.\\n5. B and C. A router bypasses the ACL logic for its own outbound ACLs for packets cre-\\nated by that router. Routers do not make any kind of exception for inbound packets.As a result, ACL B creates more risk than ACL A, because B is enabled as an inbound\\nACL.\\nThe ping 1.1.1.1 command in two answers is a self-ping of a router’s Ethernet inter-\\nface. As a result, the router would bypass any outbound ACL logic on that interface,\\nbut consider any inbound ACL logic. So router R1 would bypass the logic of ACL A,which would be enabled as an outbound ACL on R1’s G0/1 interface.\\n6. C and D. The show ip access-lists and show access-lists commands both display\\nthe configuration of IPv4 access lists, including ACL line numbers. Neither the show\\nrunning-config nor show startup-config commands list the ACL line numbers; in this\\ncase, the startup-config file would not contain the ACL configuration at all.\\nChapter 18\\n1. A, B, E. QoS tools manage bandwidth, delay, jitter, and loss.\\n2. B, C. The Class of Service (CoS) field exists in the 802.1Q header, so it would be usedonly on trunks, and it would be stripped of the incoming data link header by any\\nrouter in the path. The MPLS EXP bits exist as the packet crosses the MPLS networkonly. The other two fields, IP Precedence (IPP) and Differentiated Services CodePoint (DSCP), exist in the IP header, and would flow from source host to destinationhost.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  15\\n3. A, B, C. In general, matching a packet with DiffServ relies on a comparison to some-\\nthing inside the message itself. The 802.1p CoS field exists in the data link header onVLAN trunks; the IP DSCP field exists in the IP header; and extended ACLs check\\nfields in message headers. The SNMP Location variable does not flow inside individu-\\nal packets, but is a value that can be requested from a device.\\n4. D. Low Latency Queuing (LLQ) applies priority queue scheduling, always taking the\\nnext packet from the LLQ if a packet is in that queue. To prevent queue starvation of\\nthe other queues, IOS also applies policing to the LLQ. Most traffic chosen for LLQ\\nclassification requires low delay, jitter, and loss, so using a congestion managementtool makes little sense. Likewise, applying shaping to an LLQ slows the traffic, and\\nmakes no sense with the presence of a policing function already.\\n5. A, D. Policers monitor the bit rate and take action if the bit rate exceeds the policingrate. However, the action can be to discard some packets, or to re-mark some packets,\\nor even to do nothing to the packets, simply measuring the rate for later reporting.For shaping, when a shaper is enabled because the traffic has exceeded the shaping\\nrate, the shaper always queues packets and slows the traffic. There is no option to re-\\nmark the packets or to bypass the shaping function.\\n6. C, D. Drop management relies on the behavior of TCP, in that TCP connections slowdown sending packets due to the TCP congestion window calculation. Voice trafficuses UDP, and the question states that queue 1 uses UDP. So, queues 2 and 3 are rea-\\nsonable candidates for using a congestion management tool.\\nChapter 19\\n1. A, F. Of all the commands listed, only the two correct answers are syntactically cor-\\nrect router configuration commands. The command to enable 802.1Q trunking is\\nencapsulation dot1q vlan_id.\\n2. B, C. Subinterface G0/1.1 must be in an administratively down state due to theshutdown command being issued on that subinterface. For subinterface G0/1.2,\\nits status cannot be administratively down, because of the no shutdown command.\\nG0/1.2’s state will then track to the state of the underlying physical interface. With a\\nphysical interface state of down/down, subinterface G0/1.2 will be in a down/down\\nstate in this case.\\n3. C. The configuration of the Layer 3 switch’s routing feature uses VLAN interfaces.The VLAN interface numbers must match the associated VLAN ID, so with VLANs 1,\\n2, and 3 in use, the switch will configure interface vlan 1, interface vlan 2 (which is\\nthe correct answer), and interface vlan 3. The matching connected routes, like all con-\\nnected IP routes, will list the VLAN interfaces.\\nAs for the incorrect answers, a list of connected routes will not list any next-hop IP\\naddresses. Each route will list an outgoing interface, but the outgoing interface will\\nnot be a physical interface, but rather a VLAN interface, because the question states\\nthat the configuration uses SVIs. Finally, all the listed subnets have a /25 mask, whichis 255.255.255.128, so none of the routes will list a 255.255.255.0 mask.\\nptg1739636316  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n4. C, D. First, for the correct answers, a Layer 3 switch will not route packets on a\\nVLAN interface unless it is in an up/up state. A VLAN interface will only be up/upif the matching VLAN (with the same VLAN number) exists on the switch. If VTP\\ndeletes the VLAN, then the VLAN interface moves to a down/down state, and rout-\\ning in/out that interface stops. Also, disabling VLAN 2 with the shutdown command\\nin VLAN configuration mode also causes the matching VLAN 2 interface to fail,\\nwhich makes routing on interface VLAN 2 stop as well.\\nAs for the incorrect answers, a Layer 3 switch needs only one access port or trunk\\nport forwarding for a VLAN to enable routing for that VLAN, so nine of the ten\\naccess ports in VLAN 2 could fail, leaving one working port, and the switch would\\nkeep routing for VLAN 2.\\nA shutdown of VLAN 4 has no effect on routing for VLAN interfaces 2 and 3. Had\\nthat answer listed VLANs 2 or 3, it would definitely be a reason to make routing failfor that VLAN interface.\\n5. A, C. With a Layer 3 EtherChannel, the physical ports and the port-channel interfacemust disable the behavior of acting like a switch port, and therefore act like a routed\\nport, through the configuration of the no switchport interface subcommand. (The\\nroutedport command is not an IOS command.) Once created, the physical interfacesshould not have an IP address configured. The port-channel interface (the interface\\nrepresenting the EtherChannel) should be configured with the IP address.\\n6. B, C. With a Layer 3 EtherChannel, two configuration settings must be the same onall the physical ports, specifically the speed and duplex as set with the speed and\\nduplex commands. Additionally, the physical ports and port-channel port must all\\nhave the no switchport command configured to make each act as a routed port.\\nSo, having a different speed setting, or being configured with switchport rather\\nthan no switchport, would prevent IOS from adding interface G0/2 to the Layer 3\\nEtherChannel.\\nAs for the wrong answers, both have to do with Layer 2 configuration settings. Once\\nLayer 2 operations have been disabled because of the no switchport command, those\\nsettings related to Layer 2 that could cause problems on Layer 2 EtherChannels do\\nnot then cause problems for the Layer 3 EtherChannel. So, Layer 2 settings about\\naccess VLANs, trunking allowed lists, and STP settings, which must match beforean interface can be added to a Layer 2 EtherChannel, do not matter for a Layer 3\\nEtherChannel.\\nChapter 20\\n1. D. With this design, but no FHRP, host A can send packets off-subnet as long as con-\\nnectivity exists from host A to R1. Similarly, host B can send packets off-subnet aslong as host B has connectivity to router R2. Both routers can attach to the same LAN\\nsubnet, and basically ignore each other in relation to their roles as default router,\\nbecause they do not use an FHRP option. When either router fails, the hosts usingthat router as default router have no means by which to fail over.\\n2. C. The use of an FHRP in this design purposefully allows either router to fail and stillsupport off-subnet traffic from all hosts in the subnet. Both routers can attach to thesame LAN subnet per IPv4 addressing rules.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  17\\n3. C. HSRP uses a virtual IP address. The virtual IP address comes from the same subnet\\nas the routers’ LAN interfaces, but is a different IP address than the router addressesconfigured with the ip address interface subcommand. As a result, the hosts will\\nnot point to 10.1.19.1 or 10.1.19.2 in this design. The other wrong answer lists an\\nidea of using Domain Name System (DNS) to direct hosts to the right default router;although this idea exists in some other forms of network load balancing, it is not a\\npart of any of the three FHRP protocols.\\n4. B. The command, taken from R3, lists R3 as HSRP active. That means R3 currentlytakes on the role of the router with the virtual IP address, listed as 10.1.12.2. R3 will\\nsend back Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Reply messages when hosts send ARP\\nmessages looking for 10.1.12.2, and process packets sent to the matching virtual MACaddress. The 10.1.12.1 IP address is the interface IP address of the other router in\\nthe HSRP group, the one that is standing by to take over for Router R3. Finally, R3\\ndoes not configure the virtual IP address with the ip address interface command, but\\ninstead with the standby group ip virtual-address interface subcommand.\\n5. C. R2 has a better priority because the priority value is higher. However, because R1comes up first, R1 becomes HSRP active before R2 boots. R2 must then have pre-\\nemption configured, otherwise it will not preempt R1 to become active. As for the\\nwrong answers, R1’s preemption setting does not matter in this case. The other twowrong answers state that a router is active regardless of other settings, and the answer\\nis dependent on other configuration.\\n6. A, C. Two HSRP misconfigurations cause both HSRP routers to attempt to use thesame virtual IP address (VIP), at the same time, because both routers believe that they\\nshould be active. With a correct configuration other than mismatched group num-\\nbers, the two routers act independently, both using the VIP, resulting in the duplicateaddress message. The same kind of logic applies when the two routers have correct\\nconfiguration other than a mismatched HSRP version: they do not act together, but\\nact independently, both use the address, and then detect the duplicate use of theaddress.\\nAs for the incorrect answers, an ACL that prevents a router from even receiving the\\nHSRP messages will prevent that router from noticing the duplicate use of the VIP, so\\nit does not list the duplicate address log message. Finally, if the configuration mistake\\nis that the two routers configure two different VIPs, then they are using differentaddresses, so there is no need to issue a message about using duplicate addresses.\\nChapter 23\\n1. C, E. OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 are both link-state protocols that use the SPF algorithm to\\ncalculate the best routes. They both use the concept of being enabled on an interface,\\nand then discovering neighbors on those interfaces by using Hello messages. One key\\ndifference between the two is that OSPFv3 introduces some new link-state advertise-\\nment (LSA) types. The other key difference, of course, is that OSPFv3 supports the\\nadvertisement of IPv6 routes.\\nptg1739636318  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n2. B. OSPFv3 uses the exact same rules for choosing its router ID (RID) as does OSPFv2,\\neven choosing the 32-bit RID value based on IPv4 addresses, and not based on theIPv6 addresses. The two answers that mention the ipv6 address command have no\\nimpact on the OSPFv3 RID. For the other incorrect answer, the ospf router-id com-\\nmand does not exist; instead, the command is simply the router-id command. Only\\nthe answer with the ip address interface subcommand can impact a router’s choice of\\nOSPFv3 RID.\\n3. B. OSPFv3 does not use a network command in OSPFv3 router configuration mode,ruling out two of the answers. It does use an interface subcommand that both refers\\nto the OSPFv3 by process ID and defines the area number. The correct answer lists\\nthat interface subcommand with the correct syntax.\\n4. B. The OSPFv3 configuration would use ipv6 router ospf process-id, router-id\\nrouter-id, and then, under each interface, the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id com-\\nmand. OSPFv2 uses the exact same syntax on the router-id command. Only OSPFv3\\nuses the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommand, and OSPFv3 does\\nnot use the network command.\\n5. A, D, E. OSPFv3 uses the same rules as OSPFv2 in regard to all these items except\\nthe addresses; OSPFv3 does not require that the neighbors have IPv6 addresses inthe same subnet. Mismatched Hello timers prevents neighbor relationships, as do\\nduplicate router IDs. Also, neither can have its interface set to passive; otherwise,\\nthe neighbor relationship fails to complete. The PIDs can be different or the samebecause they are not checked as part of the choice to become neighbors.\\n6. B, D. The second line lists the forwarding instructions for the route, specifically thelink-local address of the neighboring router and the local router’s outgoing interface.\\nThese facts identify one correct and one incorrect answer. The OI code indeed means\\nOSPF and interarea; intra-area routes simply omit the I. In brackets, the first number\\nis the administrative distance, and the second number (129 in this case) is the metric.\\n7. C. The correct answer lists detailed information about OSPFv3 related to interfaceG0/1, including a notation that the interface is passive (if it is). Of the incorrectanswers, in the show ipv6 ospf interface passive command, the passive keyword\\ndoes not exist. The other two commands list all OSPFv3-enabled interfaces on therouter, but the list includes passive interfaces, with no notation about which are pas-sive and which are not.\\nChapter 24\\n1. C. IOS supports no direct method for IOS to decide which interfaces have EIGRP for\\nIPv4 enabled, and then automatically enable EIGRP for IPv6 on those same interfaces.\\nThe correct answer shows how to enable EIGRP for IPv6 directly on the two inter-\\nfaces in question. The three incorrect answers also list nonexistent commands.\\n2. A. The three incorrect answers have separate settings. The Hello timer can be set with\\nthe ip hello-timer eigrp asn timer command for EIGRP for IPv4, and with the IP the\\nipv6 hello-timer eigrp asn timer command for EIGRP for IPv6. The variance and\\nmaximum-paths commands, router subcommands, have the same syntax for both rout-ing protocols but are set separately for EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6. The inter-face bandwidth and delay commands impact both EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  19\\n3. D. The EIGRP for IPv6 configuration would use ipv6 router eigrp asn, eigrp\\nrouter-id router-id, and then, under each interface, ipv6 eigrp asn. EIGRP for\\nIPv6 does not use the router eigrp asn command (it uses the ipv6 router eigrp asn\\ncommand instead), and EIGRP for IPv6 also does not use the network command.\\n4. D. Before the changes, R1 must have had working neighbor relationships with R2, R3,\\nand R4. Once R1’s ASN is changed, R1 cannot be neighbors with those same rout-\\ners, because the ASNs must be the same number to be neighbors. As for the incor-rect answers, changing R2’s ASN makes R2’s neighborships fail, but R1 should use\\nthe redundant routes through R3 and R4. The other two answers cause no failures to\\nroutes or neighbors at all.\\n5. B, E. EIGRP for IPv6 uses the same rules as EIGRP for IPv4 in regard to all these itemsexcept the addresses; EIGRP for IPv6 does not require that the neighbors have IPv6\\naddresses in the same subnet. The two routers must use the same ASN, and neithercan have its interface set to passive; otherwise, the neighbor relationship fails to com-\\nplete. However, the Hello timer can be different, the router IDs can be the same, and\\nthe IPv6 addresses can be in different subnets.\\n6. A. The output of this command identifies the neighbor router, based on the neigh-bor’s link-local address on the link between the two routers. The two incorrectanswers that mention the router ID have to be incorrect because EIGRP for IPv6\\nrouter IDs are 32-bit values represented as dotted-decimal numbers, so they look like\\nIPv4 addresses.\\nChapter 25\\n1. C. IPv6 ACLs are names and do not use ACL numbers.\\n2. C. IPv4 ACLs can be applied to a routed interface in the inbound and outbounddirection. Similarly, IPv6 ACLs can be applied to a routed interface in the inboundand outbound direction. Therefore, it is possible to have a routed interface with four\\nACLs applied: two IPv4 ACLs (one inbound and one outbound) and two IPv6 ACLs\\n(one inbound and one outbound).\\n3. D. IPv6 ACLs use the any keyword to represent all possible IPv6 address (as in thewhole Internet). The 2001:db8:1111:1::/64 prefix uses this syntax to represent anynode on the network that has those first four hextets with the “/64” prefix length\\nnotation.\\n4. E. IPv6 ACLs can filter on any field in the IPv6 header (including flow label, next-header, etc.). IPv6 ACLs can filter ICMPv6 packets and IPv6 ACLs can filter on the\\nTCP or UDP packets with various source or destination port numbers.\\n5. B. Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages areessential to the function of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and establishment\\nand maintenance of the IPv6 interface neighbor cache. If these packets were to be\\nblocked, the neighbor cache entries on that interface would time out and affect\\nreachability to the next-hop device.\\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 26\\n1. B. SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c use community strings to authenticate Get and Set mes-\\nsages from an NMS. The agent defines a read-only community and can define a read-\\nwrite community as well. Get requests, which read information, will be accepted if the\\nNMS sends either the read-only or the read-write community with those requests.\\n2. A, C. The first parameter after the community keyword defines the community value.At the end of the command, if a text value is listed but without an ipv6 keyword, the\\ntext value is the name of an IPv4 ACL. The ACL (textvalue2 in this case) filters incom-\\ning SNMP messages received by the SNMP agent on the device.\\n3. D. To work correctly with an SNMP manager, the snmp-server user command\\nmust configure its parameters based on the security level in the referenced group as\\ndefined in the referenced snmp-server group command. In this case, the referenced\\nsnmp-server group command lists a security level of auth, so the snmp-server user\\ncommand needs the auth keyword and associated parameters, but not the priv key-\\nword and its associated parameters.\\nTwo answers are incorrect because they either do not include the auth keyword\\nand associated parameters, or because it also includes the priv keyword. Of the two\\nanswers that include only the auth option, one is incorrect by referencing 3des as an\\nauthentication hash algorithm; this keyword refers to an encryption type that could\\nfollow the priv keyword, but it is invalid as an authentication option. The correct\\nanswer correctly lists sha as a valid authentication hash option, along with the user-defined password (pass1).\\n4. A. Of these, only show snmp lists status and counter variables about the operation ofthe SNMP agent. The other commands list configuration details.\\n5. C. IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA) can generate a variety of different types ofprobes, including some that use ICMP Echo messages, and some that mimic voice\\ntraffic. However, the question asks about “ICMP Echo-based” IP SLA, referring to the\\nspecific IP SLA probe that sends ICMP Echo Request messages.\\nICMP Echo probes with IP SLA do not require a router to be configured as an IP SLA\\nresponder, although many other types of IP SLA probes do require a responder. The\\nEcho probes send a normal ICMP Echo Request, so the probe can be sent to any IPaddress, relying on that host to send back a normal ICMP Echo Reply.\\nIP SLA on the source router will gather basic statistics. With the ICMP Echo probe,\\nthe probe does not measure jitter (ruling out another incorrect answer), but it does\\nmeasure round-trip time (RTT). These statistics can be gathered into a history report,\\nwhich can be useful when troubleshooting problems.\\n6. A, B. The show ip sla summary command lists one line of information about the mostrecent attempt to perform the actions of an IP SLA probe. The Type implies an ICMPEcho probe, and the destination defines the IP address to which the Echo is sent,\\naccounting for one correct answer. The “OK” return code means not only was the probe\\nmessage sent, but in this case, that an ICMP Echo Reply packet was received back.\\nFor the two incorrect answers, the Stats column lists the round-trip time (RTT), not\\nthe one-way delay as mentioned in one answer. Also, the “1” on the far left of theoutput refers to the IP SLA operation number.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  21\\n7. C. The requirements in the question ask that you gather all traffic sent between Host1\\nand Host2, to avoid gathering extra copies of the same frame. That requirementmeans you need to capture frames sent from Host1 to Host2, and frames sent from\\nHost2 back to Host1. It also means that the solution should not capture the same\\nframe multiple times. Each incorrect answer either gathers too little traffic, or gathersthe required traffic but also more traffic than the correct answer would gather.\\nFirst, the answer of collecting from F0/1 for a single (transmit) direction is incorrect\\nbecause it gathers too little traffic. Frames sent by Host2 to Host1 would arrive in\\nswitch port F0/2 and then be sent out port F0/1 to Host1, and would be copied by\\nthe SPAN session. However, frames sent by Host1 would be received on switch port\\nF0/1, and would not be copied by that SPAN session.\\nThe answer about using VLAN 5 as a source would work, but because all FastEthernet\\nports on the switch are in VLAN 5, this option gathers more traffic than is necessary.\\nThe answer about using F0/2 as the source, for both directions of traffic, is correct. It\\nwill copy all frames sent by Host1 to Host2 (frames that the switch transmits out portF0/2), as well as frames sent by Host2 to Host1 (which will be frames received on\\nswitch port F0/2). This option does gather frames sent between Host2 and other hosts\\nas well.\\nThe final incorrect answer refers to collecting traffic from both F0/1 and F0/2, but in\\nboth directions. That option would gather all frames sent between Host1 and Host2twice, which would work, but the question asked that you gather no more traffic than\\nis required.\\n8. A, C. Local SPAN has a variety of configuration dependencies. Each Local SPAN ses-sion can have multiple sources, but they must be either interfaces or VLANs, and not\\na mix. Source ports can include both access and trunk ports as well as EtherChannelinterfaces. Finally, each SPAN destination port can be used in only one SPAN session\\nat the same time. To reuse that destination port, you must first unconfigure the desti-\\nnation port from the original SPAN session (no monitor session destination) and then\\nconfigure it to be part of another SPAN session.\\nChapter 27\\n1. B. PaaS (Platform as a Service) supplies one or more virtual machines (VM) that have\\na working operating system (OS) as well as a predefined set of software development\\ntools.\\nAs for the wrong answers, Software as a Service (SaaS) supplies a predefined software\\napplication, but typically with no ability to then later install your own applications.\\nIaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) supplies one or more working VMs, optionally withan OS installed, so it could be used for software development, but the developer\\nwould have to install a variety of development tools, making IaaS less useful than a\\nPaaS service. Finally, SLBaaS (Server Load Balancing as a Service) can be offered as a\\ncloud service, but it is not a general service in which customers get access to VMs onwhich they can then install their own applications.\\nptg1739636322  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n2. A.

Platform as a Service (PaaS)\\ncould be used to install your own application, because PaaS does supply one or more\\nVMs, but it is most likely used as a software development environment, a servicedesigned specifically to be used for development, with VMs that include various tools\\nthat are useful for software development. Finally, SLBaaS (Server Load Balancing as a\\nService) can be offered as a cloud service, but it is not a general service in which cus-\\ntomers get access to VMs on which they can then install their own applications.\\n3. A. Both options that use the Internet allow for easier migration because public cloudproviders typically provide easy access over the Internet. An intercloud exchange is apurpose-built WAN service that connects to enterprises as well as most public cloud\\nproviders, with the advantage of making the cloud migration process easier. The one\\ncorrect answer—the worst option in terms of being prepared for migrating to a newcloud provider—is to use a private WAN connection to one cloud provider. While\\nuseful in other ways, migrating when using this strategy would require installing a new\\nprivate WAN connection to the new cloud provider.\\n4. A, C. Private WAN options use technologies like Ethernet WAN and MPLS, bothof which keep data private by their nature and which include QoS services. An inter-cloud exchange is a purpose-built WAN service that connects to enterprises as well as\\nmost public cloud providers, using the same kinds of private WAN technology with\\nthose same benefits.\\nFor the two incorrect answers, both use the Internet, so both cannot provide QoS ser-\\nvices. The Internet VPN option does encrypt the data to keep it private.\\n5. C. A virtual network function (VNF) is a virtual version of a networking appliance,such as a virtual router (like the Cisco CSR) or virtual firewall (like the Cisco ASAv).\\nVNFs are deployed as a VM, with customer access to the user interface, so that cus-tomers can then configure the VNF to meet their needs.\\nCloud providers can implement many networking services that create the cloud net-work, but not give the customer direct access to the VM or appliance. For instance,\\npublic cloud providers typically provide DNS services and address assignment services\\nthat use DHCP behind the scenes, but without giving the customer direct access to aVM that implements a DNS or DHCP server.\\nptg17396363CAppendix C: Answers to the “Do I Know This Already?” Quizzes  23\\nChapter 28\\n1. A. The data plane includes all networking device actions related to the receipt, pro-\\ncessing, and forwarding of each message, as in the case described in the question. The\\nterm table plane is not used in networking. The management plane and control plane\\nare not concerned with the per-message forwarding actions.\\n2. C. The control plane includes all networking device actions that create the informa-\\ntion used by the data plane when processing messages. The control plane includesfunctions like IP routing protocols and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).\\nThe term table plane is not used in networking. The management plane and data\\nplane are not concerned with collecting the information that the data plane then uses.\\n3. C. Although many variations of SDN architectures exist, they typically use a cen-\\ntralized controller. That controller may centralize some or even all control plane\\nfunctions in the controller. However, the data plane function of receiving messages,\\nmatching them based on header fields, taking actions (like making a forwarding deci-\\nsion), and forwarding the message still happens on the network elements (switches)and not on the controller.\\nFor the incorrect answers, the control plane functions may all happen on the con-troller, or some may happen on the controller, and some on the switches. The\\nNorthbound and Southbound Interfaces are API interfaces on the controller, not on\\nthe switches.\\n4. A. The Cisco Open SDN Controller uses an Open SDN model with an OpenFlowSouthbound Interface as defined by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF). TheONF SDN model centralizes most control plane functions. The APIC model for data\\ncenters partially centralizes control plane functions. The APIC-EM controller (as of\\ntime of publication) makes no changes to the control plane of routers and switches,leaving those to run with a completely distributed control plane.\\n5. D. APIC-EM does all the features described in the answers. APIC-EM has a built-infunction to discover the topology of a network, using a variety of protocols such as\\nSSH, CDP, and LLDP. Once discovered, the APIC-EM Path Trace feature analyzes the\\nforwarding tables on each device in comparison to a source and destination as typed\\nin by an APIC-EM user. Path Trace then determines the path through the network,including the Layer 2 and Layer 3 paths.\\nThe feature that uses the name Path Trace ACL Analysis (or Path Trace ACL Trace, or\\na similar name) refers to the additional analysis done by APIC-EM to then comparethat imaginary packet to the ACLs that exist in the network. The tool shows the ACLsand points out which ACLs would deny (that is, discard) the packet based on its cur-\\nrent configuration.\\nptg17396363Practice for Chapter 16: Basic \\nIPv4 Access Control Lists\\nPractice Problems\\nThis appendix includes two sets of practice problems.

However, they cannot route packets without meaningful routes, \\nroutes for all destinations in the internetwork. And the most common way for routers to learn routes to remote subnets is to use a dynamic routing protocol. \\nRouting Information Protocol   (RIP) Version 2 (RIPv2) is the only IP routing protocol dis-\\ncussed in depth in this book. The big idea is simple: An engineer enables RIPv2 on each router. RIPv2 then takes the connected routes it knows because of interface IP address con-\\nfiguration and then advertises them by sending messages to neighboring routers. Over time, \\nas each router learns more routes, they advertise about those routes as well. By the end of the process, all routers know about all subnets, including details about redundant routes to reach each subnet. Each router can then put the best route for each subnet into its routing table, completing the goal of learning good routes to forward traffic to all subnets.\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  3\\nThis chapter, one of the longer chapters in this book, takes RIPv2 and the topic of rout-\\ning protocols from initial concept, into configuration and verifications, and ends with troubleshooting.\\nFoundation Topics\\nRIP and Routing Protocol Concepts\\nMany     IP routing protocols exist, in part due to the long history of IP. However, if you com-pare all the IP routing protocols, they all have some core features in common. Each routing protocol causes routers (and Layer 3 switches) to\\n1. Learn routing information about IP subnets from other neighboring routers\\n2. Advertise routing information about IP subnets to other neighboring routers\\n3. If a router learns of more than one route to reach one subnet, choose the best route\\nbased on that routing protocol’s concept of a metric\\n4. React to changes when the network topology changes—for example, when a link\\nfails, and converge to use a new choice of best route for each destination subnet\\nAll the routing protocols do these same four functions, but the protocols differ in the details of how they accomplish these tasks. The rest of this chapter works through the \\ndetails of how Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2) accomplishes these tasks, \\nwith a few comments about other protocols sprinkled throughout   . \\nHistory of Interior Gateway Protocols \\nHistorically         speaking, RIP Version 1 (RIPv1) was the first popularly used IP routing proto-\\ncol, with the Cisco proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later, as shown as the first wave in Figure G-1.\\n2010 2000EIGRP\\nRIP-2\\n1990OSPFv2IGRP\\n1980RIP-1\\n1st Wave IPv4:\\nDistance Vector2nd Wave:\\nIPv43rd Wave:\\nIPv6EIGRPv6\\nRIPngOSPFv3OSPFv3\\nAddress\\nFamilies\\n4th Wave:\\nIPv4 + IPv6\\nFigure G-1 Timeline for IP IGPs\\nBy the early 1990s, business and technical factors pushed the IPv4 world toward a second wave of better routing protocols. That second wave includes RIP Version 2 (RIPv2), OSPF Version 2 (OSPFv2), and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), all proto-cols found in use today for IPv4.\\nThe first and second wave of routing protocols worked with IPv4 but not IPv6. IPv6 \\nemerged in the mid-1990s as a long-term solution to IPv4 growth issues in the Internet. These new IPv6 routing protocols included EIGRP for IPv6 (sometimes called EIGRPv6), OSPF Version 3 (OSPFv3), and RIP next generation (RIPng). (Yes, RIPng was named after the Star Trek series.)\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe fourth wave shown in Figure G-1 is there mainly to overcome a bit of history with \\nOSPF and is listed here just to be fully correct. When OSPFv3 was created, it supported \\nadvertising IPv6 routes only. So, for many years, OSPFv2 implied IPv4-only, and OSPFv3 \\nimplied IPv6-only. Around 2010, OSPFv3 was improved to advertise both IPv4 and IPv6 \\nroutes using a feature called address families      . \\nComparing IGPs\\nToday,      you would most likely see the second- and third-wave routing protocols in most networks. In fact, Cisco considers IGRP to be so old that it does not even include IGRP in its more recent IOS versions. EIGRP and OSPFv2 are easily the most popular IPv4 routing \\nprotocols, with RIPv2 used much less. However, RIPv2 is listed in the ICND1 exam topics, \\nand it has one huge advantage versus EIGRP and OSPFv2: RIPv2 is easier to learn.\\nWhat is an IGP in the first place? All the routing protocols mentioned so far in this chap-\\nter happen to be categorized as interior gateway protocols (IGP) rather than as an exterior \\ngateway protocols (EGP). These two terms use the word gateway instead of router because routers were called gateways in the earliest days of IP routing. The designers of some rout-ing protocols intended the routing protocol for use inside one company or organization (IGP), with other routing protocols intended for use between companies and between \\nInternet service providers (ISP) in the Internet (EGPs). \\nThis chapter falls back to using the term IGP when talking about all the routing protocols \\nmentioned in this chapter. \\nAny time an engineer thinks about what routing protocol to use, he can make some basic \\ncomparisons between the routing protocols. The following list describes four of the major points to consider when comparing these routing      protocols: \\n■ The underlying routing protocol algorithm: Specifically, whether the routing protocoluses logic referenced as distance vector (DV) or link state (LS).\\n■ The usefulness of the metric: The routing protocol chooses which route is best based onits metric; so the better the metric, the better the choices made by that routing protocol.\\n■ The speed of convergence: How long does it take all the routers to learn about a changein the network and update their IPv4 routing tables? That concept, called convergence\\ntime, varies depending on the routing protocol.\\n■ Whether the protocol is a public standard or a vendor-proprietary function: RIP andOSPF happen to be standards, defined by RFCs. EIGRP happens to be defined by Cisco,and until 2013, was kept private.\\nRIP’s      hop count metric treats each router as a hop, so the hop count is the number of other \\nrouters between a router and some remote subnet. RIP’s hop-count metric means that RIP picks the route with the smallest number of links and routers. However, that shortest route \\nmay have the slowest links. In fact, Figure G-2 shows just such a case on the left, with RIP \\nchoosing the one-hop route from Router B to subnet 10.1.1.0, even though it crosses the slower 100-Mbps link instead of the two-hop route over two 1-Gbps links.\\nA routing protocol whose metric was based (at least in part) on link bandwidth might be \\na better choice in the topology shown in Figure G-2. For example, EIGRP does base its metric in part on link bandwidth. EIGRP, on the right side of the figure, chooses the route that happens to have more links through the network (and more hops), but both links have a faster bandwidth of 1 Gbps on each link     . \\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  5\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0\\nG0/2G0/1RIP\\nBandwidth 100 Mbps\\nBandwidth \\n1 GbpsBandwidth \\n1 GbpsEIGRP\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0\\nG0/2G0/1\\nBandwidth 100 Mbps\\nBandwidth \\n1 GbpsBandwidth \\n1 GbpsA B\\nCA B\\nC\\nFigure G-2 EIGRP Choosing the Longer but Better Route to Subnet 10.1.1.0\\nDistance Vector Basics\\nEach IGP can be categorized based on its internal logic, either distance vector (used by RIP) \\nor link state. The next few pages explain more about how a DV protocol actually exchanges routing information, using RIPv2 as an example. The ICND2 book’s chapters about OSPF \\ndescribe link state logic, and the ICND2 book’s chapters on EIGRP get into more detail \\nabout some advanced distance vector features.\\nThe Concept of a Distance and a Vector\\nThe     term distance vector describes what a router knows about each route. When a router \\nlearns about a route to a subnet, the routers learn three important facts related to each route: the destination subnet, the distance (that is, the routing protocol metric), and the vec-\\ntor (that is, the link and next-hop router to use as part of that route).\\nFigure G-3 begins to develop that concept showing RIP updates in the small boxes on the \\nleft. That is, Router R1 receives RIP updates from three neighboring routers. Each update \\ndescribes a different route for subnet X, with a different metric. The fact that a particular \\nrouter sends the RIP message identifies the next-hop router for the route. In this case, the three RIP updates advertise the following routes:\\n■ The four-hop route (distance) through R2 (vector) for subnet X\\n■ The three-hop route (distance) through R5 (vector) for subnet X\\n■ The two-hop route (distance) through R7 (vector) for subnet X\\nSubnet XSubnet X,\\nMetric 4\\nSubnet X,\\nMetric 2Subnet X,\\nMetric 3\\nRouting UpdateR1 R5R2 R3\\nR7R4\\nR6 R8\\nFigure G-3 Information Learned Using DV Protocols\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTaking Figure G-3 a step further, imagine if R1 had learned only one route to subnet X, say \\nthe route learned from R2. R1 would use that route because it is the only route R1 knows \\nfor subnet X. However, having learned three routes to subnet X, R1 picks the route with the \\nbest (lowest) metric, in this case the two-hop route through next-hop     Router R7.\\nFull Update Messages and Split Horizon\\nWhile      Figure G-3 shows a conceptual figure, Figure G-4 gets more specific about what \\nRIPv2 actually does. Like many DV protocols, RIPv2 sends a periodic routing update based on a relatively short timer. The periodic part of the term refers to the fact that RIP repeats \\nthe same update over and over on a timed basis even if nothing changes. Figure G-4 illus-\\ntrates this concept, with a detailed breakdown of the steps following the figure.\\nR1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.G0/2G0/2G0/2G0/1Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric1100\\nR2 IP Routing Table\\nSourceConn.Conn.Conn.RIPSubnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.G0/3G0/2G0/1G0/1Next-HopN/AN/AN/A172.30.1.1 Metric 0 0 0 1\\nRIP Update 172.30.11.0, metric 1 RIP Update172.30.21.0, metric 1172.30.22.0, metric 1\\nRIP Update 172.30.11.0, metric 1 RIP Update172.30.21.0, metric 1172.30.22.0, metric 1\\n……172.30.1.0 /24\\n30 Seconds 30 Seconds172.30.1.2\\n314 2\\n172.30.1.1 R1 R2 G0/3 - 172.30.21.0 /24G0/1 G0/2G0/2 - 172.30.22.0 /24\\nG0/1 - 172.30.11.0 /24\\nFigure G-4 Normal Steady-State RIP Operations: Full Update with Split Horizon\\nThis figure shows a lot of information, so take the time to work through the details, follow-\\ning the numbers in the figure versus the following list. For example, consider what switch R1 learns for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, which is the subnet connected to R2’s G0/2 interface:\\n1. R2 interface G0/2 has an IP address and is in an up/up state.\\n2. R2 adds a connected route for 172.30.22.0/24, off interface G0/2, to R2’s routingtable.\\n3. R2 advertises its route for 172.30.22.0/24 to R1, with metric 1, in a RIP update sent to\\nR1. The metric of 1 means that R1’s metric to reach this subnet will be metric 1 (hopcount 1).\\n4. R1 adds a route for subnet 172.30.22.0/24, listing it as a RIP learned route withmetric 1.\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  7\\nAlso, take a moment to focus more on the route learned at Step 4: the bold route in R1’s \\nrouting table. This route is for 172.30.22.0/24, as learned from R2. It lists R1’s local G0/2 \\ninterface as the outgoing interface because R1 received the update on R1’s G0/2 interface. \\nR1’s route also lists R2’s IP address of 172.30.1.2 as the next-hop router because that’s the \\nIP address from which R1 learned the route. Think of R1’s outgoing interface and next-hop router information as the forwarding instructions for      this route.\\nSplit Horizon\\nFigure     G-4 also shows a common DV feature called split horizon. Note that both routers \\nlist all four subnets in their IP routing tables. However, the RIP update messages do not list four subnets. The reason? Split horizon. \\nSplit horizon is a DV feature that tells a router to omit some routes from an update sent out \\nan interface. Which routes are omitted from an update sent out interface X? The routes that would use interface X as the outgoing interface. Those routes that are not advertised on an \\ninterface usually include the routes learned in routing updates received on that interface. \\nSplit horizon is difficult to learn by reading words, and much easier to learn by seeing an \\nexample. Figure G-5 continues the same example as Figure G-4, but focusing on R1’s RIP \\nupdate sent out R1’s G0/2 interface to R2. Figure G-5 shows R1’s routing table with three \\nlight-colored routes, all of which list G0/2 as the outgoing interface. When building the RIP update to send out that same G0/2 interface, split horizon rules tell R1 to ignore those light-colored routes. Only the bold route, which does not have G0/2 as an outgoing interface, can be included in R1’s RIP update sent out G0/2    .\\nR1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.G0/2G0/2G0/2G0/1Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric1100\\nRIP UpdateOnly Bold Route Has Interface\\nOther Than G0/2\\n172.30.11.0, metric 1\\nG0/3 - 172.30.21.0 /24G0/1 G0/2G0/2 - 172.30.22.0 /24\\nG0/1 - 172.30.11.0 /24 172.30.1.0 /24\\n172.30.1.2 172.30.1.1 R1 R2\\nFigure G-5 R1 Does Not Advertise Three Routes Due to Split Horizon\\nRoute Poisoning\\nDV     protocols help prevent routing loops by ensuring that every router learns that the route \\nhas failed, through every means possible, as quickly as possible. A routing loop occurs when the routes for some destination, on a set of routers, would cause a packet sent to that des-\\ntination to keep looping between those routers and never arrive at the destination. Routing \\nprotocols attempt to prevent any routing loop. One of these features, route poisoning, helps all routers know for sure that a route has failed. \\nRoute poisoning refers to the practice of advertising a failed route, but with a special met-\\nric value called  infinity. Routers consider routes advertised with an infinite metric to have \\nfailed. \\nptg173963638  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure G-6 shows an example of route poisoning with RIP, with R2’s G0/2 interface failing, \\nmeaning that R2’s route for 172.30.22.0/24 has failed.

R2’s G0/2 interface fails.\\n2. R2 removes its connected route for 172.30.22.0/24 from its routing table.\\n3. R2 advertises 172.30.22.0 with an infinite metric (which for RIP is 16).\\n4. R1 realizes that the route to 172.30.22.0/24 no longer works. Depending on conditions\\nnot discussed here, R1 either removes the route from its routing table or marks the\\nroute as unusable (with an infinite metric) for a few minutes before r emov ing the route.\\nBy the end of this process, Router R1 knows for sure that its old route for subnet 172.30.22.0/24 has failed, which helps R1 avoid introducing looping IP routes.\\nNote that all routing protocols have mechanisms to use to mark routes as expired in some \\nway, in some cases using an infinite metric value similar to RIP. RIP uses 16 per the RIP pro-\\ntocol definition; as a result, a route with hop count 15 is the longest valid route that can be \\nused in a RIP network, because advertising a route with hop count 16 would be considered \\na     poison route.\\nSummarizing RIPv2 Features\\nThis    final section briefly mentions a few more features of RIPv2, and collects those features into a table for easier review and study. \\nOf course, RIPv2 adds features beyond RIPv1. For instance, RIPv2 supports authentica-\\ntion, which is a feature by which routers can use a password-like mechanism to make sure they exchange routes only with authentic other routers. RIPv2 also supports manual route summarization, which allows an engineer to plan and reduce the size of routing tables. (The \\nDVD Appendix O, “Route Summarization,” copied from a previous edition of this book, \\nprovides more detail if you are interested.) However, this book does not get into details about these features beyond this brief mention.\\nFor another difference, RIPv2 sends its update message—the message that lists routing \\ninformation—to the 224.0.0.9 multicast IP address. RIPv1 used the local subnet broadcast \\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  9\\naddress of 255.255.255.255. Using the multicast address is more efficient and causes less \\nimpact to other hosts. \\nFinally, RIPv2 adds support for variable-length subnet masks (VLSM). Chapter 22, “Variable \\nLength Subnet Masks,” goes into detail about VLSM. To review, VLSM means that inside one classful network (one Class A, B, or C network), more than one subnet mask is used. \\nFor instance, the network in Figure G-7 uses VLSM because all the subnets are from Class A \\nnetwork 10.0.0.0, but some subnets use a /24 mask whereas others use a /30 mask   .\\n10.3.5.0 /24\\n10.3.6.0 /2410.3.7.0 /2410.2.2.0 /2410.2.3.0 /2410.2.4.0 /24YosemiteAlbuquerque\\nSeville10.1.4.0 /30\\nS0/0S0/110.1.6.0 /30\\n10.1.1.0 /24S0/0S0/1\\nFigure G-7 An Example of VLSM\\nTable G-1 lists the features comparing RIPv1 and RIPv2.

This second of four major sections of this chapter focuses on that \\ncore configuration and verification.\\nConfiguring Core RIPv2 Features\\nRIPv2     configuration is simple compared to the concepts related to routing protocols. The configuration process uses three required commands, with only one command, the network \\ncommand, requiring any real thought. You should also know the more popular show com-\\nmands for helping you analyze and troubleshoot routing protocols.\\nThe RIPv2 configuration process takes only the following three required steps, with the \\npossibility that the third step might need to be repeated several times on the same router:\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStep 1. Use the router rip command in global configuration mode to move into RIP \\nconfiguration mode.\\nStep 2. Use the version 2 command in RIP configuration mode to tell the router to use RIP Version 2 exclusively.\\nStep 3. Use one or more network net-number commands in RIP configuration mode \\nto enable RIP on the correct interfaces.\\nUnderstanding the RIP network Command\\nTo     configure RIPv2, always start with those first two commands in the configuration \\nchecklist, and then think hard about the third step, the   network command. The RIP \\nnetwork indirectly identifies the interfaces on which RIP is then enabled. The command \\nhas one parameter: some classful IP network number. IOS then compares each interface IP \\naddress of each interface on the local router with the IP network in the network command. \\nIOS enables RIP on each interface whose IP address is in that same classful network. \\nFor example, in Figure G-8, the configuration on the left uses two network commands. The \\nfirst network command happens to match one interface IP address of the four interfaces on \\nthe right, because one of the interfaces is in classful network 10.0.0.0. The second command \\nmatches two interfaces, because both are in classful network 172.16.0.0. Neither of the two  \\n  network commands match the fourth interface, which is in classful network     192.168.1.0.\\nrouter rip\\nversion 2 interface F0/0\\nnetwork 10.0.0.0 ip address 10.1.1.1…\\ninterface F0/1\\nnetwork 172.16.0.0 ip address 172.16.1.1…\\ninterface F0/2\\nip address 172.16.2.2…\\ninterface F0/3\\nip address 192.168.1.1…RIP Configuration Interface Configuration\\nFigure G-8 RIP Network Command Enabling RIP Per-Interface Logic\\nSo    , what does RIPv2 do on an interface once enabled? Well, RIP takes three separate actions once enabled on an interface. So rather than think of enabling RIP on an interface as one idea, break it into these three actions, which will help when you think about some later configuration and troubleshooting topics. The following are the three actions:\\n■ The router sends routing updates out the interface.\\n■ The router listens for and processes incoming updates on that same interface.\\n■ The router advertises about the subnet connected to the interface.\\nNote that with the version 2 command configured, the updates sent and received per this \\nlist are RIP version 2 updates.Config\\nChecklist\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  11\\nRIP Configuration Example, with Many IP Networks\\nKeeping     these facts in mind, now consider how to configure RIP on a single router. Examine \\nFigure G-9 for a moment and try to apply the first three config uration steps to this router \\nand anticipate the configuration required on the router to enable RIP on all interfaces.\\n192.168.2.0 /24G0/1\\n192.168.1.0 /24S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1 S0/0/0S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0G0/1\\nG0/1S0/0/1192.168.5.0 /24192.168.4.0 /24192.168.6.0 /24192.168.3.0 /24\\nR3\\nR2 R1192.168.5.2192.168.4.3\\nFigure G-9 RIPv2 Configuration: Three Routers, Each Connected to Three Networks\\nTake a close look at the IP subnets listed in the figure. All links use an entire Class C net-work. I chose to use different Class C networks on each link on purpose so that each router connects to multiple classful networks. For instance, R2 will need   network commands for \\nnetworks 192.68.2.0, 192.168.5.0, and 192.168.6.0. Example G-1 shows the configuration for all three routers    .\\nExample G-1 R1, R2, and R3 RIPv2 Configuration, for Figure G-9\\n!

All three routers have the router rip and version \\n2 commands, which together enable RIPv2, but without enabling RIPv2 on any interfaces. \\nNext, focus on the three network commands on each router. Each router has three \\nnetwork commands in this example because each router connects to three different classful networks. For example, R1 lists IP network 192.168.1.0, 192.168.4.0, and 192.168.5.0 in its \\nthree network commands, because according to the figure, R1 connects directly to those \\nthree IP networks. Those three commands enable RIPv2 on R1’s G0/1, S0/0/0, and S0/0/1 \\ninterfaces. The network commands on the other two routers enable RIPv2 on their inter-faces, respectively.\\nThis particular example configuration gives us a good backdrop to discuss a common ques-\\ntion about RIPv2 configuration and network commands. First, no one router has network \\ncommands for all six classful IP network numbers. The   network command does not pre-\\ndefine all classful networks in the entire topology. Instead, it triggers local logic on that \\none router, matching the network commands against the interface IP addresses on that one \\nrouter, as shown earlier in Figure G-8.\\nFinally, on a complete side note about the RIP network command: IOS will actually accept \\na parameter besides a classful network number. IOS will not even issue an error message. \\nHowever, IOS, knowing that the parameter must be a classful network number, interprets \\nthe IP address and changes the number to the matching network number. For example, if you were to type network 10.1.2.3 in RIP configuration mode, IOS would accept the com-mand, with no error message, and change what you typed so that the configuration has a \\nnetwork 10.0.0.0 command. Your original   network 10.1.2.3 command would disappear    . \\nRIP Configuration Example, with One IP Network\\nFigure     G-9, used in the first RIP configuration example, purposefully used many IP net-\\nworks so that the configuration required several RIPv2 network commands. However, often a design will use subnets of one classful network, as shown in Figure G-10. In this case, all \\nsix subnets are subnets of Class A network 10.0.0.0. Note that Figures G-9 and G-10 are \\nidentical other than the IPv4 subnets used.\\n10.1.2.0 /24G0/1\\n10.1.1.0 /24S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1 S0/0/0S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0G0/1\\nG0/1S0/0/1 10.1.5.0 /2410.1.4.0 /2410.1.6.0 /2410.1.3.0 /24\\nR3\\nR2 R1\\nFigure G-10 Three Routers, Each Connected to Subnets of Class A Network 10.0.0.0\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  13\\nTo enable RIPv2 on all interfaces, each router needs only one   network command: the \\nnetwork 10.0.0.0 command.

Notice the legend at the \\ntop—about 10 lines of output—which are the same for every show ip route command. The \\nlegend lists the routing codes, which are short codes that identify the source from which a \\nroute is learned. In this case, Router R1 IPv4 routes with three codes—C, L, and R—mean-\\ning connected, local, and RIP. \\nScan farther down in the output to see the individual routes. The routes list the subnet \\nand then mask in prefix format, followed by other details. Ignoring the detail for another \\nmoment, notice the three highlighted RIP-learned routes, both in the output of the show \\nip route command and in the show ip route rip command at the end of the example. The highlighted lines show the same routes, but the show ip route rip command lists only the \\nRIP routes, and not the connected and local routes.\\nEach line in the output of these commands reveals many details about a route. Using R1’s \\nroute to 192.168.2.0/24 as an example, the details are as follows: \\n■ The         network number and mask are listed, 192.168.2.0 and /24 in this case. (In somecases, the mask is on a heading line just above the route.)\\n■ The next-hop router’s IP address is 192.168.5.2 in this case.\\n■ The outgoing interface is Serial0/0/0 in this case.\\n■ The update RIP timer that measures how long it has been since R1 has last heard aboutthis route in a periodic RIP update is 21 seconds ago in this case.\\n■ The RIP metric for this route (1 in this case), is listed as the second number in the squarebrackets. For example, between R1 and subnet 192.168.2.0/24, one other router (R2)exists, so it is a one-hop route.\\n■ The administrative distance of the route is 120 in this case; the first number in brackets.\\nTake the time now to review the other two RIP routes, noting the values for these various \\nitems in those routes. \\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  15\\nTo better understand RIP metrics, think for a moment what would happen in this three-\\nrouter topology of Figure G-9 if R1’s S0/0/0 interface failed. R1’s one-hop route to 192.168.2.0/24 uses that outgoing interface, but if it were to fail, R1 would converge to \\nuse the two-hop route that runs through R3 next. Example G-4 shows the RIP routes on R1 \\nagain after that         failure.\\nExample G-4 The show ip route Command with New Metric 2 for Subnet 192.168.2.0 \\nR1# show ip route rip\\n!

In this case, the network, mask, and administrative distance remain the same. However, the metric is now 2, because this route goes through R3 and then R2, for two hops. It also lists forwarding directions of going through 192.168.4.3 (R3’s S0/0/0 \\nIP address) and going out R1’s S0/0/1         interface.\\nComparing Routing Sources with Administrative Distance\\nAs       you just examined, when an internetwork has redundant links and uses a single routing \\nprotocol, each router may learn multiple routes to reach a particular subnet. That one rout-ing protocol then uses a metric to choose the best route, and the router adds that route to \\nits routing table. For instance, R1 uses the metric 1 route for 192.168.2.0/24 when all links \\nwere working, and then the metric 2 route for 192.168.2.0/24 when a link in that better route failed.\\nHowever, some enterprises use multiple IP routing protocols. One router might learn of \\nmultiple routes to a particular subnet using different routing protocols. In these cases, the metric does not help the router choose which route is best, because each routing protocol uses a metric unique to that routing protocol. For example, RIP uses the hop count as the metric, but EIGRP uses a math formula with bandwidth and delay as inputs. A route with \\nRIP metric 1 might need to be compared to an EIGRP route, to the same subnet, but with \\nmetric 4,132,768. (Yes, EIGRP metrics tend to be large numbers.) Because the numbers have different meanings, there is no real way to compare the metrics.\\nThe router still needs to choose the best route even between routes learned by different \\nrouting protocols, or between routing protocols and static routes. IOS solves this problem \\nby assigning a numeric value to each routing protocol. IOS then chooses the route whose \\nrouting protocol has the lower number. This number is called the administrative distance \\n(AD). For example, EIGRP defaults to use an AD of 90, and RIP defaults to use the value of 120, as shown in the routes in Examples G-3 and G-4. Given the lower-is-better logic used with administrative distance, an EIGRP route to a subnet would be chosen instead of a com-peting RIP       route. \\nptg1739636316  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable G-3 lists the AD values for the most common sources of routing information.\\nTable G-3 IOS Defaults for Administrative Distance\\nRoute Source Administrative Distance\\nConnected routes 0\\nStatic routes 1\\nEIGRP 90\\nOSPF 110\\nRIP (v1 and v2) 120\\nDHCP default route 254\\nUnknown or unbelievable 255\\nNOTE You might recall a brief mention of administrative distance in Chapter 18, \\n“Configuring IPv4 Addresses and Static Routes.” That chapter explained how to configure a floating static route that was used only when the routing protocol did not learn a route for \\na given subnet, using administrative distance as the key mechanism      .\\nRevealing RIP Configuration with the show ip protocols Command\\nT h e        show ip route command shows the end result of RIP’s work, but the show ip protocols  \\ncommand tells us something about how RIP works and about the RIP configuration. Example \\nG-5 lists the output of this command, taken from Router R1 in Figure G-9, again based on the \\nconfiguration in Example G-1. \\nExample G-5 The show ip protocols Command Based on Example G-1 Configuration\\nR1# show ip protocols\\nRouting Protocol is \"rip\" \\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Sending updates every 30 seconds, next due in 23 seconds\\n  Invalid after 180 seconds, hold down 180, flushed after 240\\n  Redistributing: rip\\n  Default version control: send version 2, receive version 2\\n    Interface Send  Recv  Triggered RIP  Key-chain\\n    GigabitEthernet0/1    2     2\\n    Serial0/0/0 2     2\\n    Serial0/0/1 2     2\\n  Automatic network summarization is in effect\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    192.168.1.0\\n    192.168.4.0    192.168.5.0\\nRouting Information Sources:\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  17\\n    Gateway Distance Last Update\\n    192.168.4.3 120 00:00:18\\n    192.168.5.2 120 00:00:05\\n  Distance: (default is 120)\\nThe example highlights the configuration information that can be gleaned from the output, \\nat least for configuration commands mentioned in this chapter, as follows:\\n■ The version 2       RIP subcommand configured R1 to send version 2 updates only and to\\nprocess received version 2 updates only as well.\\n■ Automatic summarization (per the default auto-summary command) is enabled.\\n■ The maximum-paths command is set to 4 (also the default).\\n■ The “Routing for Networks” section re-lists the configuration of network commands,listing the network numbers in those commands. In this case, it implies three RIP sub-commands: network 192.168.1.0, network 192.168.4.0, and network 192.168.5.0.\\nThe output also lists RIP status information. For instance, look at the bottom of the exam-ple, to the “Routing Information Sources” section (not highlighted). It lists two gateways (that is, routers) by IP address. This list is the list of IP addresses of neighboring routers from which R1 has heard RIP updates. (If you look back to Figure G-9, you will see these two IP addresses as addresses on R3 and R2, respectively.) The last update timer lists the \\ntime since R1 last heard from the neighbor; remember, RIP relies on the periodic receipt of \\nRIP updates to know that the neighbor still exists. In short, this list shows that R1 is learning RIP routes from these two routers      .\\nExamining the Best RIP Routes Using RIP Database \\nOne more command can reveal some important details about RIP operation on a router: the show ip rip database command. This command lists the prefix/length of each subnet \\nknown to the local router’s RIP process. This command lists the local router’s best route to \\neach known subnet. In particular, this command lists\\n■ Routes for subnets learned from other RIP routers\\n■ Routes for connected subnets for which RIP is enabled on interfaces due to the RIP\\nnetwork command(s)\\nThe fact that the show ip rip database command lists both learned routes and connected \\nroutes for RIP-enabled interfaces makes this command unique. In comparison, Examples G-3 \\nand G-4 show samples of the show ip route  command from R1 in Figure G-10, listing RIP-\\nlearned routes. However, you cannot tell for sure on which interfaces RIP has been enabled based on this output. Example G-5 shows how the show ip protocols  command identifies the \\ninterfaces on which RIP is enabled, with three interfaces on that same Router R1. However, \\nthis command does not identify any RIP-learned routes.\\nAs shown in Example G-6, the show ip rip database command lists both connected and RIP-\\nlearned routes. The sample is again taken from Router R1 in Figure G-10, with all interfaces \\nworking. The output identifies the same three RIP-learned routes listed in Example G-4, with the hop-count metrics in brackets and the next-hop router IP addresses listed (R2, address 10.1.5.2, and R3, 10.1.4.3). The output also lists the connected subnets, identifying the inter-faces on which RIP has been enabled. \\nptg1739636318  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample G-6 The show ip rip database Command on Router R1 (Figure G-10)\\nR1# show ip rip database\\n10.0.0.0/8    auto-summary\\n10.1.1.0/24    directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/1\\n10.1.2.0/24\\n    [1] via 10.1.5.2, 00:00:00, Serial0/0/0\\n10.1.3.0/24\\n    [1] via 10.1.4.3, 00:00:08, Serial0/0/1\\n10.1.4.0/24    directly connected, Serial0/0/1\\n10.1.5.0/24    directly connected, Serial0/0/0\\n10.1.6.0/24\\n    [1] via 10.1.5.2, 00:00:00, Serial0/0/0\\n    [1] via 10.1.4.3, 00:00:08, Serial0/0/1\\nOptional RIPv2 Configuration and Verification\\nThis next major section, the third of four major sections in this chapter, introduces a few \\noptional RIPv2 features. The features are passive interfaces, maximum (routing) paths, auto-matic route summarization, and discontiguous networks.\\nControlling RIP Updates with the passive-interface Command\\nIn some       cases, you want to enable RIP on an interface so that you can advertise about the connected subnet, but you do not need to advertise routes on that interface. This is typi-cally true for any router LAN interface for which that router interface is the only interface \\nconnected to the LAN. No other routers connect to the LAN, so the router does not need \\nto send updates onto the LAN. \\nThe RIPv2 passive-interface command can be used to stop all RIPv2 updates from being \\nsent out the interface that is matched by a network command. By making an interface pas-\\nsive to RIP, the RIP process no longer sends RIP updates out that interface. RIP will still \\nprocess any received updates and will still advertise about the connected subnet.\\nIOS gives us two configuration methods to make interfaces passive. The first is the most \\nobvious: use the passive-interface type number RIP subcommand for each interface that \\nyou want to make passive to RIP. \\nExample G-7 shows a revised version of the Router R1 configuration first shown in \\nExample G-2. In that example, all three routers (from Figure G-10) connect to subnets of network 10.0.0.0. All three routers also have a G0/1 LAN interface that connects to a LAN that has no other routers connected to it. Example G-7 shows the original configuration from Example G-2, with the addition of the passive-interface command to make the LAN \\ninterface       passive.\\nExample G-7 Directing RIPv2 to Not Send Advertisements with passive-interface\\nrouter rip\\n version 2\\n network 10.0.0.0\\n passive-interface G0/1\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  19\\nThe second configuration method flips the logic: Make all interfaces passive by default, \\nwith the passive-interface default RIP subcommand, and then selectively make interfaces not be passive, with the no passive-interface type number RIP subcommand. Using this \\nmethod makes sense when a router has mostly passive interfaces and only a few nonpassive interfaces. However, just to show the configuration, Example G-8 converts the configura-tion of Example G-7 to this alternate style, under the assumption that R1 has three inter-faces enabled for RIP: S0/0/0 and S0/0/1 (which should not be passive), and G0/1 (which should be       passive). \\nExample G-8 Using the passive-interface default Command Option\\nrouter rip\\n version 2\\n network 10.0.0.0\\n passive-interface default\\n no passive-interface s0/0/0\\n no passive-interface s0/0/1\\nSupporting Multiple Equal-Cost Routes with Maximum Paths\\nWhat       should a router do when it learns multiple routes for the same subnet but the metrics \\ntie? Routing protocols use their metrics to choose the best route to each destination subnet, but with RIP’s hop-count metric, ties can easily happen. So RIP needs options for how to deal with a tie.\\nRIP’s default behavior when it learns more than one route that ties is to put multiple routes \\ninto the routing table and use them all. Once in the routing table, the router’s forwarding logic balances the packets across those equal-metric routes. \\nFor instance, consider Figure G-11. R1 will learn two different 2-hop routes to subnet \\n10.1.4.0 (a router with R3 as the next-hop router and a route with R2 as the next-hop rout-er). R1 will then place both routes in its routing table, with equal metric (2). When R1 needs to forward a packet to subnet 10.1.4.0, R1 can send some packets over one route and some over the other, balancing the load.\\n2-Hop Route2-Hop Route\\nR1R3\\nR2R410.1.4.0\\nFigure G-11 Equal-Cost Routes with RIP\\nCisco refers to this feature of using multiple equal-metric routes to the same destination as \\n equal-cost load balancing. RIP controls this behavior with the maximum-paths number-of-\\npaths RIP subcommand, whose default setting of 4 means that RIP will use the feature by \\ndefault, with up to 4 equal cost routes for each subnet. This command can be set larger (the maximum setting is dependent on the route model and IOS version), and it can be set as low \\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nas 1. Setting the value to 1 disables the feature, so that RIP places the first-learned equal-\\nmetric route into the routing table      .\\nUnderstanding Autosummarization and Discontiguous Classful \\nNetworks\\nOlder         routing protocols, namely RIPv1 and IGRP, were classified as  classful routing proto-\\ncols. These older classful routing protocols had to use a more careful and cautious subnet \\ndesign plan to avoid a problem called a discontiguous classful network. These simpler old \\nrouting protocols just got confused when a classful network became discontiguous, because of a required feature of classful routing protocols called autosummarization.\\nToday, most enterprises use OSPF or EIGRP, or in a few cases, RIPv2. All these proto-\\ncols are classless routing protocols. These classless routing protocols either do not have a \\nproblem with discontiguous classful networks or can be configured so they do not have a problem. In fact, when using RIPv2, if you simply configure the   no auto-summary RIP sub-\\ncommand on every router, you can avoid the problem altogether. But of course, it helps to understand what the problem is as well, so this section looks at both autosummarization and \\nthe discontiguous network problem.\\nA routing protocol that uses autosummarization automatically creates a summary route \\nunder certain conditions. That automatic process happens when\\n■ That one router connects to subnets of multiple different classful networks\\n■ That router uses a routing protocol that uses the autosummary feature. (Note that class-ful routing protocols had to use this feature and could not disable it.)\\nTo see specifically what that means, consider Figure G-12, which shows one router (R3) that \\nconnects to several subnets of network 10.0.0.0 on the right and to a serial link in network \\n172.16.0.0 on the left. In other words, R3 meets the first criteria in the list. If using a rout-ing protocol with the autosummarization feature, R3, when advertising a route to the left toward R2, would automatically create a summary route: a route for the entire Class A net-work 10.0.0.0, as shown in the figure        .\\nR3 R2S0/0/0I Only Learned  About \\n10.0.0.0/8 - No Subnets!\\n172.16.3.0/24\\nNot in 10.0.0.0I Have a Route\\nto 10.0.0.0/8\\n172.16.1.0/24\\nNot in 10.0.0.03.3\\n12 3\\n10.3.5.0/24\\n10.3.6.0/24\\n10.3.7.0/24\\nFigure G-12 Autosummarization Example\\nFollowing         the steps in the figure:\\n1. R3 has autosummary enabled, with the RIPv2   auto-summary router subcommand.\\n2. R3 advertises a route for all of Class A network 10.0.0.0, instead of advertising routes\\nfor each subnet inside network 10.0.0.0, because the link to R2 is a link in anothernetwork (172.16.0.0).\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  21\\n3. R2 learns one route in network 10.0.0.0: a route to 10.0.0.0/8, which represents all of\\nnetwork 10.0.0.0, with R3 as the next-hop router.\\nAutosummarization is not necessarily bad by itself, but when combined with a design that \\ncreates a discontiguous classful network, the combination is bad. Which of course begs the \\nquestion of what is a discontiguous classful network? First, more formally:\\nContiguous network:  A network topology in which subnets of network X are not sepa-\\nrated by subnets of any other classful network\\nDiscontiguous network: A network topology in which subnets of network X are sepa-\\nrated by subnets of some other classful         network\\nFigure G-13 makes the idea more obvious. First, look to the far left and right and see the \\nsubnet IDs for several subnets of network 10.0.0.0. Then look in the center, and see subnets \\nof network 172.16.0.0. The subnets of network 10.0.0.0 are separated by subnets of another network, so network 10.0.0.0 is discontiguous.\\n10.3.5.0/24\\n10.3.6.0/24\\n10.3.7.0/24172.16.3.0/24R1 R310.2.2.0/24\\n10.2.3.0/2410.2.4.0/24R2 S0/0/0 S0/0/1\\n172.16.2.0/242.1 3.3Which Route To\\n10.0.0.0/8 Do I Believe?

With autosummarization on both R1 and R3, R1 declares with its routing update “All of network 10.0.0.0 is over here.” R3 does the same. R2, in the middle, is confused and does not even realize that it is confused. If R2 sends all packets destined for network 10.0.0.0 to the left, the hosts in the subnets on the right will be unreachable, and vice versa. \\nIf R2 balances the traffic over the two routes to network 10.0.0.0, sending some to the left \\nand some to the right, then it appears that random hosts work for short periods of time.\\nThis problem has two solutions. The old-fashioned solution is to create IP addressing plans \\nthat do not create discontiguous classful networks. In other words, keep all subnets of each \\nclassful network together in a design. For instance, in this case, use subnets of network 10.0.0.0 for those links in the middle of the figure, or use subnets of a third classful net-work instead of the 172.16.0.0 subnets on the left.\\nThe other solution solves the problem by disabling autosummarization with the   no auto-\\nsummary RIPv2 subcommand. This command is needed on the router that connects to both \\nclassful networks (Routers R1 and R3 in Figure G-13), because those are the routers that automatically create summary routes. Figure G-14 shows the results with this solution: R1 \\nand R3 advertise about all their subnets to R2, and R2 knows specific routes for each sub-\\nnet, solving the problem        .\\nptg1739636322  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n10.3.5.0/24\\n10.3.6.0/24\\n10.3.7.0/24172.16.3.0/24R1 R310.2.2.0/24\\n10.2.3.0/2410.2.4.0/24R2 S0/0/0 S0/0/1\\n172.16.2.0/242.1 3.3I Know Exactly\\nWhere to Send\\nEach Packet!Routes for:\\n10.3.5.0/2410.3.6.0/2410.3.7.0/24Routes for:10.2.2.0/2410.2.3.0/2410.2.4.0/24\\nFigure G-14 The Effect of no auto-summary on the Network from Figure G-13\\nVerifying Optional RIP Features\\nAll       the configuration settings for these optional features can be seen in the output of the \\nshow ip protocols command.

Use the   maximum-paths number command in RIP configuration mode to set \\nthe number of equal-metric routes for a single destination subnet to add to the \\nIP routing       table.\\nRIPv2 Default Routes\\nIn network designs that use a single router at a remote site, the remote router can use a \\ndefault route rather than using a routing protocol. The section “Static Default Routes” in Chapter 18 shows that exact scenario, with branch offices, each with a single router. Each \\nbranch office router could use a static default route that forwards packets over the single \\nWAN link toward the core of the enterprise network.\\nIn some designs, the network engineer might want to use the default route concept, except \\nthat multiple routers may exist in that part of the network. All the routers in that part of the \\nnetwork would need to forward their packets to the one router that has a WAN link con-nected to another part of the enterprise or to the Internet. \\nFigure G-15 shows an example, with enterprise routers R1, B01, and B02 all wanting to \\nuse the one link to the Internet that is connected to R1. To make that work, R1 uses a default route that points directly over that link to the Internet. Routers B01 and B02 have default routes that forward packets to R1, so R1 will then forward packets by default to the Internet. (The figure shows the default routes on each router as arrow lines.)\\nInternetDefaultDefault\\nDefaultISP1\\nB02B01\\nR1\\nFigure G-15 Branch Routers with Default Route to R1; R1 with Default Route to Internet\\nLearning Default Routes Using Static Routes and RIPv2\\nThe enterprise routers in this design could each use a static default route, but RIPv2 pro-\\nvides an alternative that uses a static default route on only one router. One router, directly connected to the link of the true default route, configures a static default route as normal. \\nThat router then uses RIPv2 to advertise a default route—a route to 0.0.0.0, mask /0—to \\nthe other routers. Basically, the remote routers learn default routes like those shown for routers B01 and B02 in Figure G-15, pointing to the router that originally advertised the \\ndefault route. \\nFigure G-16 shows the basic idea of what happens on the router on which the static default \\nroute is configured. R1 configures a static route to the Internet at Step 1, and then adver-tises that static route to the other routers with RIPv2 at Step 2.\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  25\\n12\\n2InternetRIPv2 Advertises Default\\nRIPv2 Advertises Default192.0.2.1\\nG0/3\\nG0/2G0/1G0/1\\nG0/1\\nip route 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  192.0.2.1ISP1\\nB02B01\\nR1\\nFigure G-16 A Scenario for RIPv2 to Advertise Default Routes\\nThe key to making the process work is the addition of the default-information originate \\ncommand to the RIP configuration on the router where the static default route is configured, \\nas demonstrated in Example G-11. This new RIP subcommand tells the router simply this:\\nIf the IPv4 routing table has a default route in it, advertise a default route with RIP, with \\nthis local router as the eventual destination of those default routes.\\nNote that only the router that originally advertises the default route—Router R1 in the \\nexample shown in the figure—needs the default-information originate command. Other \\nRIPv2 routers, like B01 and B02 in the example, learn the default route like any other RIP-learned route. \\nExample G-11 Configuring Router R1 to Advertise a Default Route with RIPv2\\nR1# configure terminal\\nR1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.0.2.1\\nR1(config)# router rip\\nR1(config-router)# default-information originate\\nR1(config-router)# end \\nR1#\\nTo verify the configuration, first check on the static default route. The configuration and \\nverification of the static default route on Router R1 looks the same as it did in the “Static Default Routes” section in Chapter 18. Example G-12 shows a sample from Router R1; note \\nthe static route to prefix/length 0.0.0.0/0 and the Gateway of Last Resort set to the next-\\nhop address of 192.0.2.1.\\nExample G-12 Displaying the Static Default Route Configured on Router R1\\nR1# show ip route static     \\n!

Note that the route for 0.0.0.0/0 shows up with a code of R, meaning that it is a RIP-learned route. The route also has an * beside it, \\nmeaning that this route is a candidate to be the default route for this router. The Gateway \\nof Last Resort (which is the chosen default route for this router) lists the same next-hop IP address listed in the RIP-learned default route. Example G-13 shows an example from router B01, which will use a default route with next-hop address 10.1.12.1, which is R1’s IP address on the WAN link.\\nExample G-13 Router B01 with Default Route Learned Using RIPv2\\nR1# show ip route rip     \\n!

Hosts can also learn other important details using DHCP, like the subnet mask to use, the DNS server \\nIP addresses, and the IP address of the router on the subnet to use as the default gateway. \\nRouters that connect to the Internet can use DHCP as well. In particular, a router with a link \\nto the Internet can dynamically learn the interface IPv4 address it should use. Additionally, \\nDHCP announces the IP address of the ISP’s router on the other end of the Internet con-\\nnection, listed as the default gateway in the DHCP messages. And that default gateway IP address is the address the enterprise router would normally use as the next-hop address on its default route to the Internet.\\nTo pull those ideas together, examine the details in Figure G-17 . The figure repeats the same \\ndesign shown in the previous two figures, with one change. In this case, enterprise Router R1 uses DHCP to learn its IP address (192.0.2.2). The DHCP process also lists a default gateway, \\n192.0.2.1, which in this case identifies the ISP router’s IP address on the link.\\n12\\nUse Address 192.0.2.2\\nUse Gateway 192.0.2.1\\nDHCPInternet192.0.2.1\\nISP1\\nB02B01\\nR1DHCP-learned: 0.0.0.0 /0, Next-hop 192.0.2.1\\nFigure G-17 Enterprise Router Building and Advertising Default Routes with \\nDHCP Client\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  27\\nBy dynamically learning the IP address of the ISP router, Router R1 can dynamically add \\na default route to its routing table. R1’s new default route will use the default gateway IP address from the DHCP message—which is the ISP router’s IP address—as the next-hop \\naddress. Then, using the same RIPv2 methods and the default-information originate RIP \\nsubcommand configured on Router R1, R1 will advertise a default route to the other routers.\\nExample G-14 shows the configuration on Router R1. Note that it begins with R1 configur-\\ning its G0/1 interface to use DHCP to learn the IP address to use on the interface, using the \\nip address dhcp command. \\nExample G-14 Learning an Address and Default Static Route with DHCP\\nR1# configure terminal\\nR1(config)# interface gigabitethernet0/1\\nR1(config-if)# ip address dhcp\\nR1(config-if)# end \\nR1#\\nR1# show ip route static     \\n! Legend omitted\\nGateway of last resort is 192.0.2.1 to network 0.0.0.0\\nS*    0.0.0.0/0 [254/0] via 192.0.2.1\\nThe end of the example shows the default route added to R1’s routing table as a result of \\nlearning a default gateway address of 192.0.2.1 from DHCP. Oddly, the route shows this route as a static route, although the route is learned dynamically. In fact, the only difference \\nin the output of the show ip route static command in this case, versus the case with the \\nstatic route as configured with the ip route command, is the administrative distance of 254. IOS uses a default administrative distance of 1 for static routes configured with the ip route \\nconfiguration command (as seen in Example G-12). When adding a route to the default gateway, as learned with DHCP, IOS uses a default administrative distance of 254, as shown \\nhere in Example G-14.\\nFinally, not shown in the example, the remote routers still learn the route, so R1 also needs \\nthe default-information originate RIP subcommand. On those remote routers like B01 and \\nB02, there is no difference in the show command output for the default routes.\\nTroubleshooting RIPv2\\nWelcome     to this fourth and final major section of this chapter, a section that focuses on \\ntroubleshooting RIPv2.\\nTroubleshooting on the ICND1, ICND2, and CCNA R&S exams requires thinking about \\nquestion types. First, Sim questions typically begin with a broken configuration, and to answer the question, you must reconfigure one or more devices to fix the configuration. To prepare for Sim questions, you need to master the art of correct configuration so that you \\nquickly recognize the incorrect configuration. The earlier topics have already covered con-\\nfiguration in some depth.\\nHowever, Simlet questions make you exercise your verification and troubleshooting skills, \\nand this final section hopes to focus more on those skills. With Simlet questions, you do \\nptg1739636328  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nsee a Simulator where you can issue commands. The lab may or may not be configured cor-\\nrectly, and you may or may not be able to see the configuration. \\nTo be ready for these types of questions, you must be ready to predict what different \\nsymptoms would be when a network was misconfigured in a particular way, and what the available show commands would look like. With RIPv2, that primarily means that you have \\nto think about the output of the show ip route and show ip protocols commands, in cases \\nof misconfiguration, which is the focus of this section.\\nThis section examines the most common misconfiguration items with the RIP settings \\nincluded in this chapter, with a discussion of typical symptoms. The end of the section sum-\\nmarizes these common issues for easier review and study.\\nAll the examples in this section use the same small sample topology, specifically chosen as a \\ngood backdrop to discuss the issues in this section. Figure G-18 shows the topology, inter-\\nfaces, and IP subnets, and Example G-15 that follows shows the correct configuration     on \\nboth routers.\\n192.168.1.96/27 192.168.12.0/27 192.168.12.96/27\\nR1 R2G0/1 G0/2 G0/1 G0/2\\nFigure G-18 Sample Network for Troubleshooting Examples\\nExample G-15 R1     and R2 Correct RIPv2 Configuration\\n!

Basically, two things happen:\\n■ The router does not advertise about the subnets on those interfaces.\\n■ The router does not exchange routing information with other routers on those interfaces.\\nImagine that the engineer left out either of the network commands on Router R1 in \\nExample G-15. Can you imagine the results? Can you predict the output of the show ip \\nprotocols command—the one command that reveals RIPv2 configuration details other than the show running-config command? \\nConsider the omission of the network 192.168.12.0 command from R1 first. Per the figure, \\nthat means that R1 would not enable RIPv2 on the link between R1 and R2, so that R1 and \\nR2 would not exchange RIPv2 routes at all. The show ip protocols command on R1 would \\nnot list R2 as an information source, and that output on R1 would omit R1’s G0/2 interface in the list of interfaces. Example G-16 shows those facts with R1’s show ip protocols command output for just this example with a missing network 192.168.12.0 command.\\nExample G-16 show ip protocols on R1 with Missing network 192.168.12.0 Command\\nR1# show ip protocols\\nRouting Protocol is \"rip\" \\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Sending updates every 30 seconds, next due in 4 seconds\\n  Invalid after 180 seconds, hold down 180, flushed after 240\\n  Redistributing: rip\\n  Default version control: send version 2, receive version 2\\n    Interface Send  Recv  Triggered RIP  Key-chain\\n    GigabitEthernet0/1    2     2\\n  Automatic network summarization is not in effect\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    192.168.1.0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n  Distance: (default is 120)\\nIn       particular, note that R1 lists only one interface in its list of interfaces (G0/1) and no infor-\\nmation sources, per the highlighted sections. It also lists only one network under the head-ing “Routing for Networks,” which is the section that lists the networks in the configured \\nnetwork commands.\\nNow think about the opposite case, in which the configuration of Example G-17 omits the \\nnetwork 192.168.1.0 command but includes the network 192.168.12.0 command. In that \\ncase, R1 and R2 will communicate with RIP. But what symptoms might you expect to see? In this case, R1 will not advertise about the subnet off R1’s G0/1 interface, 192.168.1.96/27, because there is no network command matching that interface. As a result, R2 will not list \\nptg1739636330  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n192.168.1.96/27 in its IP routing table, and R1 will not list its interface G0/1 in the list of \\nenabled interfaces in the output of the show ip protocols command. Example G-17 shows \\nthe output from show ip protocols on R1 in this case    .\\nExample G-17 show ip protocols on R1 with Missing network 192.168.1.0 Command\\nR1# show ip protocols\\nRouting Protocol is \"rip\" \\n  Outgoing update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Incoming update filter list for all interfaces is not set\\n  Sending updates every 30 seconds, next due in 4 seconds\\n  Invalid after 180 seconds, hold down 180, flushed after 240\\n  Redistributing: rip\\n  Default version control: send version 2, receive version 2\\n    Interface Send  Recv  Triggered RIP  Key-chain\\n    GigabitEthernet0/2    2     2\\n  Automatic network summarization is not in effect\\n  Maximum path: 4\\n  Routing for Networks:\\n    192.168.12.0\\n  Routing Information Sources:\\n    Gateway         Distance Last Update\\n    192.168.12.2 120 00:00:12\\n  Distance: (default is 120)\\nAgain, this example provides another chance to practice an important troubleshooting skill: \\nto re-create the RIP configuration’s network commands based on the output of the show \\nip protocols command. The section with the heading “Routing for Networks” in Example \\nG-17 lists only 192.168.12.0, meaning that only the network 192.168.12.0 command \\nexists. Earlier, Example G-16 lists only 192.168.1.0, meaning only the network 192.168.1.0 \\ncommand exists in that       case.\\nIssues Related to Passive Interfaces\\nThe        passive-interface command has a basic and useful function, but when used incorrectly, \\nnot only does it cause problems but the problem has an odd symptom. The passive interface feature should never be used on an interface that connects to another RIP router. However, \\nif one router is incorrectly configured to be passive, whereas a neighboring router is not, the \\npassive router still hears RIP updates, while the correctly configured router does not hear updates. \\nFor example, imagine you start with the correct configuration shown in Example G-15 \\nagain. Then imagine that the engineer misreads the figure and adds a passive-interface g0/2 \\ncommand to R1, instead of a passive-interface g0/1 command (which would make sense). \\nFigure G-19 shows the results: R1 quits sending RIP updates to R2, but R2 keeps sending \\nthem to R1. R1 has the incorrect configuration but R2 suffers.\\nptg17396363GAppendix G: Learning IPv4 Routes with RIPv2  31\\nPassiveR1 R2G0/1 G0/2 G0/1 G0/2\\nI Heard Nothing.I Heard an Update!\\nRIPRIP\\nFigure G-19 One-Way Exchange of Routes with Incorrect Passive Interface\\nAnytime you see a RIP problem in which routes are not being learned, make sure to check \\nfor passive interfaces in the configuration and with      show ip protocols.\\nIssues Related to auto-summary\\nThe     earlier section “Understanding Autosummarization and Discontiguous Classful Networks” discussed when a network needs to disable the use of autosummarization. But when you do need to disable automatic summarization, there is one common mistake: to \\nput the   no auto-summary command on the wrong router.\\nAs noted earlier, the   auto-summary and no auto-summary setting only impacts routers \\nthat connect directly to multiple classful networks. In the small network topology used in this troubleshooting section (Figure G-18), R1 directly connects to subnets of two different \\nclassful networks, so a no auto-summary command would affect its operation. R2 does not connect to subnets of two different classful networks, so a no auto-summary command on \\nR2 would have no effect.\\nFirst, the original configuration in Example G-15 lists a no auto-summary command on \\nRouter R1. As a result, R1 does not perform automatic summarization, instead advertising \\na route for 192.168.1.96/27 to R2. Example G-18 shows that route on Router R2 in the top half of the example.\\nExample G-18 show ip route rip on R2 with Different auto-summary Settings on R1\\n!

In this case, the design does not create a \\ndiscontiguous classful network, so no real problem exists. However, changing R1 to use the \\nauto-summary setting would cause R2 to learn a different route: R1 would advertise a route \\nfor Class C network 192.168.1.0/24 to R2, instead of a route for subnet 192.168.1.96/27. The second half of Example G-18 shows that route, after that change to the configurations of R1 and R2    .\\nptg1739636332  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRIP Issues Caused by Other Router Features\\nRIP     could be configured perfectly but still not work due to other issues. This last part of the \\ntroubleshooting section takes a brief look at these other features.\\nFirst, RIP operates only on working interfaces; that is, interfaces that are in an up and up \\nstatus per the   show interfaces and   show ip interfaces commands. Chapter 17, “Operating \\nCisco Routers,” and Chapter 24, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing,” go into more detail about issues that can cause an interface to fail. \\nRIP requires that all neighbors on a link be in the same subnet. That makes good sense from \\nan IP design perspective, but it is the kind of error that can be easily created for an exam question. For instance, Example G-15—the correct configuration to go along with Figure \\nG-15 and the examples in this troubleshooting section—shows R1 and R2 with addresses \\n192.168.12.1 and 192.168.12.2, both with mask /27 on their shared Ethernet link. If R2 had been misconfigured with 192.168.12.202/27, R1’s 192.168.12.1/27 address/mask would be in a different subnet, and R1 and R2 would ignore the RIP updates received from each other.\\nFinally, you have not yet gotten to the chapters about access control lists (ACL) yet \\n(Chapter 25, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists,” and Chapter 26, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists,” cover ACLs), but ACLs act as packet filters. The router can watch packets as \\nthey pass through the router, match the packet header, and decide to filter some packets \\nbased on those matches. The ACL configuration could inadvertently match and discard RIP messages. As it turns out, the RIP uses UDP as a transport protocol, with well-known UDP port 520. Any ACL that matches and discards these packets cause the symptom in which the RIP configuration is correct but the routers do not hear from each     other. \\nSummary of RIP Troubleshooting Issues\\nSummarizing     the troubleshooting issues ment ioned in this section, for easier review and study:\\nStep 1. The RIP network command controls where RIP operates. If a missing network \\ncommand fails to enable RIP on an interface:\\nA. RIP will not advertise about that connected subnet.\\nB. RIP will not send advertisements out that interface or process received advertisements in that interface.\\nStep 2. The passive-interface command should not be used for interfaces that connect \\nto other routers. If configured, the passive router does not advertise routes to neighboring routers, even though the passive router can still learn RIP routes \\nfrom RIP messages entering that interface.\\nStep 3. The no auto-summary command has an impact only on routers that directly \\nconnect to more than one classful network.

Today, Frame Relay has become less popular, being replaced by several other WAN \\noptions. These include the virtual private network (VPN) technology, as discussed back in \\nChapter 7, “Virtual Private Networks,” and Ethernet WANs, as introduced in the ICND1 book. In addition, many enterprises use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPNs, \\nwhich follow the same basic service model as Frame Relay, usually offered by the same \\nFrame Relay providers but with significant technical advantages. \\nAlthough many companies choose other WAN options today, Frame Relay still has uses. \\nSome companies still use it as a core WAN technology. It can also be used to connect to \\nMPLS and Internet VPNs. So, Frame Relay will be an important networking topic for some \\ntime.\\nThis chapter describes Frame Relay protocol details, with Chapter 14, “Implementing \\nFrame Relay,” discussing how to configure Frame Relay. The first section of this chapter \\nfocuses on the basics of Frame Relay, including a lot of new terminology. The second sec-\\ntion examines Frame Relay data link addressing. This topic requires some attention because Frame Relay addresses are needed for both router configuration and troubleshooting. The \\nlast major section of this chapter examines some network layer concerns when using Frame \\nRelay.  \\nFoundation Topics\\nFrame Relay Overview\\nFrame Relay networks provide more features and benefits than simple point-to-point WAN \\nlinks, but to do that, Frame Relay protocols  are more detailed. For example, Frame Relay networks are multiaccess networks, which means that more than two devices can attach to \\nptg17396363the network, similar to LANs. Unlike with LANs, you cannot send a data link layer broad-\\ncast over Frame Relay. Therefore, Frame Relay networks are called nonbroadcast multi-access (NBMA) networks   . Also, because Frame Relay is multiaccess, it requires the use of an \\naddress that identifies to which remote router each frame is addressed.\\nFigure H-1 outlines the basic physical topology and related terminology in a Frame Relay \\nnetwork.\\nDCEFrame\\nRelay\\nLMI\\nMessagesAccess\\nLink\\nLMI\\nMessagesDCE\\nFrame\\nRelay\\nSwitchDTE\\nFrame\\nRelay\\nSwitchDTE\\nR2 R1Access\\nLink\\nFigure H-1 Frame Relay Components\\nFigure H-1 shows the most basic components of a Frame Relay network. A leased line is installed between the router and a nearby Frame Relay switch; this link is called the access \\nlink. To ensure that the link is working, the device outside the Frame Relay     network, called \\nthe data terminal equipment (DTE), exchanges regular messages with the Frame Relay \\nswitch. These keepalive messages, along with other messages, are defined by the Frame \\nRelay Local Management Interface (LMI) protocol   . The routers are considered DTE, and the Frame Relay switches are data communications equipment (DCE).\\nNOTE The terms DCE and DTE have different meanings in different contexts. Here, with \\na Frame Relay service, the roles are as described in the previous paragraph. On a physical leased line, the DCE provides Layer 1 clocking, and the DTE receives and reacts to the \\nDCE’s clock signal. These are two different (and accepted) uses of the same two terms.\\nFigure H-1 shows the physical connectivity at each connection to the Frame Relay network, \\nand Figure H-2 shows the logical, or     virtual, end-to-end connectivity associated with a vir-\\ntual circuit (VC).\\nVirtual\\nCircuitDLCI X DLCI YR1 R2\\nFigure H-2 Frame Relay PVC Concepts\\nThe logical communications path between each pair of DTEs is a VC. The dashed line in the \\nfigure represents a single VC; this book uses a thick dashed line style to make sure that you \\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nnotice the line easily. The service provider usually preconfigures all the required details of a \\nVC; predefined VCs are called permanent virtual circuits (PVC).\\nRouters use the data link connection identifier (DLCI) as the Frame Relay address   ; it iden-\\ntifies the VC over which the frame should travel. So, in Figure H-2, when R1 needs to forward a packet to R2, R1 encapsulates the Layer 3 packet into a Frame Relay header and \\ntrailer and then sends the frame. The Frame Relay header includes the correct DLCI, iden-\\ntifying the PVC connecting R1 to R2, so that the provider’s Frame Relay switches correctly \\nforward the frame to R2.\\nTable H-1 lists the components shown in Figures H-1 and H-2 and some associated terms. \\nAfter the table, the most important features of Frame Relay are described in further detail.\\nTable H-1 Frame Relay T erms and Concepts\\nTerm Description\\nVirtual circuit (VC) A logical     concept that represents the path that frames travel between \\nDTEs.

Originally, back in the 1990s, the Frame Relay Forum, a vendor consortium, defined many of the original specifications. Over time, the ITU and ANSI picked up many of the forum’s standards. \\nptg17396363HAppendix H: Understanding Frame Relay Concepts  5\\nNow that you have heard some of the big ideas and key terms from Frame Relay, the next \\nfew topics go into more depth about the core functions within Frame Relay: virtual circuits, \\nthe LMI protocol, framing, and Frame Relay addressing.\\nVi rtual Circuits\\nFrame Relay     provides significant advantages over simply using point-to-point leased lines. \\nThe primary advantage has to do with VCs. Consider Figure H-3, which shows a typical Frame Relay network with three sites.\\nBobLarry\\nServer1\\nR1R2\\nR3\\nFigure H-3 Typical Frame Relay Network with Three Sites\\nA VC defines a logical path between two Frame Relay DTEs. The     term virtual circuit \\ndescribes the concept well. It acts like a point-to-point circuit, enabling the sending of data between two endpoints over a WAN. There is no physical circuit directly between the two \\nendpoints, so it is virtual. For example, R1 terminates two VCs—one whose other endpoint \\nis R2, and one whose other endpoint is R3. R1 can send traffic directly to either of the \\nother two routers by sending it over the appropriate VC.\\nVCs share the access link and the Frame Relay network. For example, both VCs terminating \\nat R1 use the same access link. R1 can send one Frame Relay frame to R2, and then another \\nframe to R3, sending both over the same physical access link. \\nNot only does a single customer router share its access link among many VCs, many cus-\\ntomers share the same Frame Relay network. Originally, people with leased-line networks \\nwere reluctant to migrate to Frame Relay because they would be competing with other Frame Relay customers for the provider’s capacity inside the cloud. To address these fears, Frame Relay uses a concept of a committed information rate (CIR). Each VC has a CIR, \\nwhich is a guarantee by the provider that a particular VC gets at least that much bandwidth. \\nSo, you can migrate from a leased line to Frame Relay, getting a CIR of at least as much bandwidth as you previously had with your leased line.\\nOne big advantage of Frame Relay over leased lines is that Frame Relay provides connectiv-\\nity to each site, with only a single access link between each router and the Frame Relay pro-vider. Interestingly, even with a three-site network, it’s probably less expensive to use Frame Relay than to use point-to-point links because the access links tend to be relatively short, to some nearby     Frame Relay provider point of presence (PoP).\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFrame Relay and other multiaccess WAN technologies have an even bigger cost advantage \\nwith larger enterprise WANs. For instance, imagine an organization with 100 sites, with one \\nrouter at each site. To connect each pair of routers with a leased line, that company would \\nneed 4950 leased lines! And besides that, each router would need 99 serial interfaces. With \\nFrame Relay, each router could use one serial interface and one access link into the Frame Relay cloud, for a total of 100 access links. Then, the Frame Relay provider could create a PVC between each pair of routers (a total of 4950 VCs). The Frame Relay solution requires \\na lot fewer actual physical links, and you would need only one serial interface on each \\nrouter.\\nService providers can build their Frame Relay networks more cost-effectively than for \\nleased lines. As you would expect, that makes it less expensive for the Frame Relay cus-\\ntomer as well. For connecting many WAN sites, Frame Relay is simply more cost-effective \\nthan leased lines.\\nWhen the Frame Relay network is engineered, the design might not include     a VC between \\neach pair of sites. Figure H-3 includes PVCs between each pair of sites; this is called a  full-\\nmesh Frame Relay network. When not all pairs have a direct PVC, it is called a  partial-mesh \\nnetwork. Figure H-4 shows the same network as Figure H-3, but this time with a partial \\nmesh and only two PVCs. This is typical when R1 is at the main site and R2 and R3 are at \\nremote offices that rarely need to communicate directly.\\nBobLarry\\nServer1\\nR1R2\\nR3\\nFigure H-4 Typical Partial-Mesh Frame Relay Network\\nThe partial mesh has some advantages and disadvantages compared to a full mesh. Partial-\\nmesh designs save money compared to full-mesh designs because the provider charges per VC. The downside is that traffic from R2’s site to R3’s site must go to R1 first and then \\nbe forwarded. If that is a small amount of traffic, it is a small price to pay. If it is a lot of \\ntraffic, a full mesh is probably worth the extra money because traffic going between two \\nremote sites would have to cross R1’s     access link twice.\\nLMI and Encapsulation Types\\nWhile     the PVC gives two customer routers a logical means to send frames to one another, \\nFrame Relay has many physical and logical components that have to work together to \\nptg17396363HAppendix H: Understanding Frame Relay Concepts  7\\nmake those PVCs work. Physically, each router needs a physical access link from the router \\nto some Frame Relay switch. The provider has to create some kind of physical network \\nbetween those switches, as well. In addition, the provider has to do some work so that the \\nframes sent over one PVC arrive at the correct destination.\\nFrame Relay uses the Local Management Interface (LMI) protocol to manage each physical \\naccess link and the PVCs that use that link. These LMI messages flow between the DTE (for \\nexample, a router) and the DCE (for example, the Frame Relay switch owned by the service \\nprovider). \\nThe most     important LMI message relating to topics on the exam is the LMI status inquiry \\nmessage. LMI status messages perform two key functions:\\n■They perform a keepalive function between the DTE and DCE. If the access link has a\\nproblem, the absence of keepalive messages implies that the link is down.\\n■They     signal whether a PVC is active or inactive. Even though each PVC is predefined, its\\nstatus can change. An access link might be up, but one or more VCs could be down. The\\nrouter needs to know which VCs are up and which are down. It learns that information\\nfrom the switch using LMI status messages.\\nInterestingly, due to historical reasons, Cisco routers have three options for different varia-\\ntions of LMI protocols: Cisco, ITU, and ANSI. Each LMI option differs slightly and there-\\nfore is incompatible with the other two. As long as both the DTE and DCE on each end of \\nan access link use the same LMI standard, LMI works fine.\\nConfiguring the LMI type is easy. Today’s most popular option is to use the default LMI \\nsetting. This setting uses the LMI autosense feature, in which the router simply figures out \\nwhich LMI type the switch is using. So, you can simply let the router autosense the LMI and never bother coding the LMI type. If you choose to configure the LMI type, the router disables the autosense feature. Table H-2 outlines the three LMI types, their origin, and the \\nkeyword used in the Cisco IOS software frame-relay lmi-type  interface subcommand    .\\nTable H-2 Frame Relay LMI Types\\nName Document IOS LMI-Type Parameter\\nCisco Proprietary cisco\\nANSI T1.617 Annex D ansi\\nITU Q.933 Annex A q933a\\nFrame Relay Encapsulation and Framing\\nA Frame Relay-connected router encapsulates each Layer 3 packet inside    a Frame Relay \\nheader and trailer before it is sent out an access link. The header and trailer are defined by Frame Relay (or more specifically, the Link Access Procedure Frame Bearer Services [LAPF] \\nspecification, ITU Q.922-A). The sparse LAPF framing provides error detection with an FCS \\nin the trailer, a DLCI field (discussed in detail later in this chapter), plus a few other header \\nfields. Figure H-5 diagrams the frame.\\nptg173963638  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFCS\\nDLCI (Usually 10 Bits)LAPF\\nHeaderInformationLAPF\\nTrailer\\nFigure H-5 LAPF Framing\\nHowever,   routers actually use a longer header than just the standard LAPF header because \\nthe standard header does not provide all the fields usually needed by routers. In particular, Figure H-5 does not show a Protocol Type field. Each data link header needs a field to \\ndefine the type of packet that follows the data link header. If Frame Relay is using only the \\nLAPF header, DTEs (including routers) cannot support multiprotocol traffic because there is \\nno way to identify the type of protocol in the Information field.\\nTwo solutions were created to compensate for the lack of a Protocol Type field in the stan-\\ndard Frame Relay header:\\n■Cisco and three other companies created an additional header, which comes between the\\nLAPF header and the Layer 3 packet shown in Figure H-5. It includes a 2-byte Protocol\\nType field, with values matching the same field Cisco uses for HDLC.\\n■RFC 1490 (and later 2427), Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay  , defined the\\nsecond solution. RFC 1490 was written to ensure multivendor interoperability between\\nFrame Relay DTEs. This RFC defines a similar header, also placed between the LAPF\\nheader and Layer 3 packet, and includes a Protocol Type field as well as many other\\noptions  . \\nFigure H-6 outlines these two alternatives.\\nIncludes Protocol Type FieldLAPF\\nHeader\\n Includes  DLCICisco PacketLAPF\\nTrailer\\nLAPF\\nHeaderRFC\\n1490PacketLAPF\\nTrailer\\nFigure H-6 Cisco and RFC 1490/2427 Encapsulation\\nRouters should agree on the encapsulation used; the switches do not care. However, each \\nVC can use a different encapsulation. In the configuration, the encapsulation created by \\nCisco is called cisco, and the other one is called ietf.\\nNow that you have a broad understanding of Frame Relay concepts and terminology, the next section takes a much closer look at Frame Relay DLCIs  .\\nFrame Relay Addressing\\nAt a basic conceptual level, Frame Relay addresses, called data link connection identi-\\nfiers (DLCI)    , have some similarity with the more familiar MAC and IP addresses. All these addresses exist as binary values, but they all have some more convenient format: hex for MAC addresses, dotted decimal for IP, and decimal for DLCIs. Frame Relay defines \\nptg17396363HAppendix H: Understanding Frame Relay Concepts  9\\nthe DLCI as a 10-bit value, written in decimal, with the low- and high-end values usually \\nreserved. (The specific range does not matter much because the service provider assigns the \\nvalues, but they usually range from around 17 to a little less than 1000.)\\nWhen you dig deeper, particularly into how DLCIs impact the forwarding of Frame Relay \\nframes, the similarities to MAC and IP addressing fades, and stark differences appear. This \\nsection focuses on that forwarding logic, first discussing the idea that Frame Relay ad-\\ndresses actually identify one end of a PVC. Following that, the discussion turns to the for-\\nwarding logic used inside the Frame Relay cloud    .\\nFrame Relay Local Addressing\\nThe service provider assigns each PVC two local DLCI values: one on one end of the PVC,      and one for the other end. The term local DLCI has several different origins, but you can \\nthink of the word local as emphasizing the fact that from a router’s perspective, the local \\nDLCI is the DLCI used on the local end of the PVC where the router sits. Figure H-7 shows \\nthe idea. \\nDLCI\\n42DLCI\\n40\\nDLCI\\n40AB\\nCDLCI\\n41\\nFigure H-7 Two PVCs, with One DLCI per End of Each PVC \\nIn this      example, the PVC between routers A and B has two DLCIs assigned by the provider. Router A’s end uses local DLCI 41 to identify the PVC, and router B’s end uses DLCI 40 to identify the same PVC. Similarly, the PVC between routers A and C, as usual, has two local \\nDLCIs assigned, one on each end. In this case, router A’s end uses 42, and router C’s end \\nuses 40. \\nThe service provider could have used any DLCI values within the range of legal values, with \\none exception: \\nThe local DLCIs on a single access link must be unique among all PVCs that use one phys-\\nical Frame Relay access link, because Frame Relay DLCIs are locally significant.\\nBecause the provider chooses the DLCIs, the enterprise network engineer does not need to \\nworry about avoiding making the wrong choice for DLCI value. For the sake of understand-\\ning the technology, know that on each physical access link from one router to the Frame Relay network, the DLCI values must be unique. In Figure H-7, the provider has defined \\ntwo PVCs that cross router A’s one Frame Relay access link: one with local DLCI 41, and one with local DLCI 42. If another PVC were added, connected to router A, the provider just could not use 41 or 42 as the local DLCI on router A’s access link.\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe local router only sees or knows the local DLCI. When you configure a router, you \\nconfigure only the local DLCI value, not the DLCI on the other end of the PVC. Likewise, \\nshow commands list only local DLCI      values.\\nFrame Forwarding with One DLCI Field \\nThe most     significant difference between the two other popular addresses in CCNA Routing \\nand Switching (MAC and IP) versus DLCIs relates to the whole forwarding process. The Ethernet header includes both a source and destination MAC address, and the IP header \\nincludes a source and destination IP address. However, the Frame Relay header lists only \\none DLCI field, and it does not identify a source or a destination, but the PVC. \\nTo get an idea of how the provider forwards a Frame Relay frame, consider the fact that \\nthe provider knows the local DLCI used on both ends of the PVC, plus the access links that \\nconnect to those routers. For instance, in Figure H-8, the provider knows that a PVC exists between router A and router B. They know it uses local DLCI 41 on the router A side. And they know it uses DLCI 40 on the router B side. Keeping that in mind, take a look at Figure H-8, which shows what happens when router A sends a frame to router B.\\n4140Change 41 to 40\\nAB\\nC12\\n3\\nFigure H-8 Frame Relay Forwarding: Router A to Router B\\nThe figure     shows three major steps. First, router A decides to send a frame over the PVC connected to router B. From router A’s perspective, A knows that PVC only as the PVC with local DLCI 41, so A sends a frame with DLCI 41 in the header. At Step 2, the service \\nprovider does a lot. They look at the information they know about this PVC, forward the \\nframe over toward router B, and they change the DLCI to 40. At Step 3, when the frame \\narrives at router B, it has a DLCI value of 40. Router B correctly thinks that the frame \\narrived over the PVC from router A, because router B’s only knowledge of that PVC is that it is the PVC whose local DLCI (on router B’s end) is 40.\\nNote that when A sent the frame, A used its local DLCI value (41), and when B received the \\nframe, B saw its local DLCI (40). \\nTo complete the process, think about a packet sent by router B back toward router A. \\nAgain, the routers only know local DLCI values, so as shown in Figure H-9, B sends the \\nframe with DLCI 40, which identifies the A-to-B PVC; the cloud changes the DLCI to 41; \\nand router A receives the frame with     DLCI 41 in it.\\nptg17396363HAppendix H: Understanding Frame Relay Concepts  11\\n4140Change 40 to 41\\nAB\\nC32\\n1\\nFigure H-9 Frame Relay Forwarding: Router B to Router A\\nThe same idea happens on each and every PVC. Earlier, Figure H-7 introduced two PVCs, \\nincluding an A-to-C PVC, with local DLCIs 42 (A side) and 40 (C side). Figure H-10 shows the local DLCIs in two different frame flows: first from A to C, and then from C back to A     .\\n42\\n4042 40AB\\nC1\\n42\\n3\\nFigure H-10 Frame Relay Forwarding Between Routers A and C\\nThis figure does not point out the cloud’s action of swapping the DLCI values, but the action still takes place. At Step 1, router A forwards a frame, with DLCI 42. At Step 2, when it exits the cloud toward router C, it has been changed to use DLCI 40, router C’s local \\nDLCI for this PVC. Similarly, at Step 3, router C sends a frame, with local DLCI 40. The \\ncloud changes the DLCI to 42, so that when it exits the cloud toward router A at Step 4, the \\nframe lists router A’s local DLCI, which is 42    .\\nNetwork Layer Addressing with Frame Relay\\nFrame Relay networks have both similarities and differences as compared to LAN and point-to-point WAN links. These differences introduce some additional considerations for passing Layer 3 packets across a Frame Relay network. In particular, Frame Relay gives us \\nthree different options for assigning subnets and IP addresses on Frame Relay interfaces:\\n■One subnet containing all Frame Relay DTEs\\n■One subnet per VC\\n■A hybrid of the first two options\\nThis section examines the three main options for IP addressing over Frame Relay.\\nptg1739636312  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFrame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: One Subnet Containing All Frame \\nRelay DTEs\\nFigure       H-11 shows the first alternative, which is to use a single subnet for the Frame Relay \\nnetwork. This figure shows a fully meshed Frame Relay network because the single-subnet option is usually used when a full mesh of VCs exists. In a full mesh, each router has a VC \\nto every other router, meaning that each router can send frames directly to every other \\nrouter. This more closely resembles how a LAN works. So, a single subnet can be used for all the routers’ Frame Relay interfaces, as configured on the routers’ serial interfaces. Table H-3 summarizes the addresses used in Figure H-11.\\nS0/1/1\\nS0/1/1 S0/1/1\\nRaleigh Mount Pilot\\nSubnet\\n199.1.11.0/24199.1.1.3 199.1.1.2\\nSubnet\\n199.1.12.0/24Subnet\\n199.1.10.0/24\\nSubnet\\n199.1.1.0/24199.1.1.1Mayberry\\nFigure H-11 Full Mesh with IP Addresses\\nTable H-3 IP Addresses with No Subinterfaces\\nRouter IP Address of Frame Relay Interface\\nMayberry 199.1.1.1\\nMount Pilot 199.1.1.2\\nRaleigh 199.1.1.3\\nThe single-subnet alternative is straightforward, and it conserves       your IP address space. It \\nalso looks like what you are used to with LANs, which makes it easier to conceptualize. \\nUnfortunately, most companies build partial-mesh Frame Relay networks, and the single-subnet option has some deficiencies when the network is a partial mesh.\\nFrame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: One Subnet Per VC\\nThe second IP addressing alternative, having a single subnet for each        VC, works better with \\na partially meshed Frame Relay network, as shown in Figure H-12. Boston cannot forward frames directly to Charlotte because no VC is defined between the two. This is a more typical Frame Relay network because most organizations with many sites tend to group applications on servers at a few centralized locations and most of the traffic is between each remote site and those servers.\\nptg17396363HAppendix H: Understanding Frame Relay Concepts  13\\nThe        single-subnet-per-VC subnetting design uses the same logic as a set of point-to-point links. \\nUsing multiple subnets instead of one larger subnet does waste some IP addresses. However, using a single subnet in the partial-mesh design of Figure H-12 introduces several problems \\nwith routing protocols because not all routers in the subnet can send messages directly to each \\nother. Partial-mesh designs work better with a single-subnet-per-VC approach. \\nS0/1/1140.1.1.0/24140.1.3.0/24\\nS0/1/1140.1.2.0/24\\nS0/1/1\\n140.1.12.0/24DLCI 51 DLCI 51 DLCI 51DLCI\\n53\\n140.1.14.0/24140.1.11.0/24\\nCharlotte\\n140.1.13.0/24BostonFrame Relay\\nPartial MeshAtlanta\\nNashvilleDLCI 52 DLCI 54\\nFigure H-12 Partial Mesh with IP Addresses\\nTable H-4 shows the IP addresses for the partially meshed Frame Relay network shown in \\nFigure H-12.\\nTable H-4 IP Addresses with Point-to-Point Subinterfaces\\nRouter Subnet IP Address\\nAtlanta 140.1.1.0 140.1.1.1\\nCharlotte 140.1.1.0 140.1.1.2Atlanta 140.1.2.0 140.1.2.1Nashville 140.1.2.0 140.1.2.3Atlanta 140.1.3.0 140.1.3.1Boston 140.1.3.0 140.1.3.4\\nCisco IOS software has a configuration feature called  subinterfaces that creates a logical \\n       subdivision of a physical interface. Subinterfaces allow the Atlanta router to have three IP \\naddresses associated with its serial 0/1/1 physical interface by configuring three separate sub-interfaces. A router can treat each subinterface, and the VC associated with it, as if it were a point-to-point serial link. Each of the three subinterfaces of serial 0/1/1 on Atlanta would be \\nassigned a different IP address from Table H-5. (Example 14-8 in Chapter 14 shows Atlanta’s \\nconfiguration to match the address in Table H-5, including the subinterfaces of S0/1/1.)\\nNOTE The example uses IP address prefixes of /24 to keep the math simple. In \\nproduction networks, point-to-point subinterfaces usually use a prefix of /30 (mask 255.255.255.252) because that allows for only two valid IP addresses—the exact number needed on a point-to-point subinterface. Of course, using different masks in the same net-work means that your routing protocol must also support VLSM.\\nptg1739636314  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFrame Relay Layer 3 Addressing: Hybrid Approach\\nThe third alternative for Layer 3 addressing is a hybrid of the first    two alternatives. Consider \\nFigure H-13, which shows a trio of routers with VCs between each of them, and two other VCs to remote sites.\\nTwo options exist for Layer 3 addressing in this case. The first is to treat each VC as a \\nseparate Layer 3 group. In this case, five subnets are needed for the Frame Relay network. However, Routers A, B, and C create a smaller full mesh among each other. This allows \\nRouters A, B, and C to use one subnet. The other two VCs—one between Routers A and D \\nand one between Routers A and E—are treated as two separate Layer 3 groups. The result is a total of three subnets.\\nBCDEA\\nSubnet\\n140.1.1.0\\nS0/1/1 S0/1/1S0/1/1\\nS0/1/1 S0/1/1Subnet\\n140.1.2.0Subnet\\n140.1.3.0\\nFigure H-13 Hybrid of Full and Partial Mesh\\nTo accomplish either style of Layer 3 addressing in this third and final case, subinterfaces are used. Point-to-point subinterfaces are used when a single VC is considered to be all that is in the group—for instance, between routers A and D and between routers A and E. \\nMultipoint subinterfaces are used when more than two routers are considered to be in the \\nsame group—for instance, with routers A, B, and C.\\nMultipoint subinterfaces    logically terminate more than one VC.

Although the ICND2 exam \\nobjectives do not explicitly reference the content covered here, the skills and concepts cov-\\nered are important to have a solid understanding of as a future IT professional. All referenc-\\nes to other content in this appendix refer to Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 \\n200-101 Official Cert Guide and not this book.\\nChapter 13, “Understanding Frame Relay Concepts,” introduced and explained the main \\nconcepts behind Frame Relay. This chapter shows you how to configure the features on Cisco routers, how to verify that each feature works, and how to troubleshoot problems with forwarding packets over a Frame Relay network.\\nFoundation Topics\\nFrame Relay Configuration and Verification\\nFrame Relay configuration can be very basic or somewhat detailed, depending on how many default settings can be used. By default, Cisco IOS automatically senses the Local Management Interface (LMI) type and automatically discovers the mapping between DLCI \\nand next-hop IP addresses (using Inverse Address Resolution Protocol [ARP]). If you use \\nall Cisco routers, the default to use Cisco encapsulation works without any additional configuration. If you also design the Frame Relay network to use a single subnet, you can configure the routers to use their physical interfaces without any subinterfaces—making \\nthe configuration shorter still. In fact, using as many default settings as possible, the only \\nnew configuration command for Frame Relay, as compared to point-to-point WANs, is the encapsulation frame-relay command.\\nFrame Relay questions on CCNA exams can prove difficult for a couple of reasons. First, \\nFrame Relay includes a variety of optional settings that you can configure. Second, for net-work engineers who already have some experience with Frame Relay, that experience may be with one of the three main options for Frame Relay configuration (physical, multipoint, or point-to-point), but the exams cover all options. So, it is important for the exams that \\nyou take the time to look at samples of all the options, which are covered here.\\nptg17396363Planning a Frame Relay Configuration\\nEngineers must do a fair amount of planning before knowing where to start with the con-\\nfiguration. When planning for new sites, you must consider the following items and com-\\nmunicate them to the Frame Relay provider, which in turn has some impact on the routers’ \\nFrame Relay configurations:\\n■Define which physical sites need a Frame Relay access link installed, and define the\\nclock rate (access rate) used on each link.\\n■Define each VC by identifying the endpoints and setting the committed information rate\\n(CIR).\\n■Agree to an LMI type (usually dictated by the provider).\\nThe network engineer who plans the Frame Relay configuration must also choose the fol-\\nlowing settings, independent of any settings of the Frame Relay provider:\\n■Choose the IP subnetting scheme: one subnet for all virtual circuits (VC), one subnet for\\neach VC, or a subnet for each fully meshed subset.\\n■Pick whether to assign the IP addresses to physical, multipoint, or point-to-point sub -\\ninterfaces.\\n■Choose which VCs need to use IETF encapsulation instead of the default value of cisco.\\n(IETF encapsulation is usually used when one router is not a Cisco router.)\\nAfter the planning has been completed, the configuration steps flow directly from the choices made when planning the network. The following list summarizes the configuration \\nsteps, mainly as a study tool. (You do not need to memorize the steps; the list is just a tool \\nto help organize your thinking about the configuration.)\\nStep 1.\\n Configure the physical interface to use Frame Relay encapsulation \\n(encapsulation frame-relay interface subcommand).\\nStep 2.  Configure an IP address on the interface or subinterface (ip address subcom-\\nmand).\\nStep 3.  (Optional) Manually set the LMI type on each physical serial interface \\n(frame-relay lmi-type interface subcommand).\\nStep 4.  (Optional) Change  from the default encapsulation of cisco, to ietf, by doing \\nthe following:\\nA. For all VCs on the interface, add the ietf keyword to the encapsulation \\nframe-relay interface subcommand.\\nB. For a single VC, add the ietf keyword to the frame-relay interface-dlci \\ninterface subcommand (point-to-point subinterfaces only) or to the \\nframe-relay map command.\\nStep 5.  (Optional) If you aren’t using the (default) Inverse ARP to map the DLCI to the \\nnext-hop router’s IP address, define static mapping using the frame-relay map \\nip ip-address dlci broadcast subinterface subcommand.\\nptg173963634\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nStep 6.

The design for the first example includes the following choices:\\n■Install an access link into three routers.\\n■Create a full mesh of PVCs.\\n■Use a single subnet (Class C network 199.1.1.0 in this example) in the Frame Relay\\nnetwork.\\n■Configure the routers using their physical interfaces.\\n■Take the default settings for LMI, Inverse ARP, and encapsulation.\\nExamples I-1, I-2, and I-3 show the configuration for the network shown in Figure I-1.\\nS0/1/1\\nS0/1/1 S0/1/1\\nRaleig h Mount Pilo t\\nSubne t\\n199.1.11 .0/24199.1.1.3 199.1.1.2\\nSubnet\\n199.1.12.0/24Subnet\\n199.1.10.0/24\\nSubnet\\n199.1.1.0/24199.1.1.1Mayberry\\nFigure I-1  Full Mesh with IP Addresses\\nExample I-1  Mayberry Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1\\n encapsulation frame-relay\\n ip address  199.1.1.1  255.255.255.0\\n!\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 5\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address  199.1.10.1  255.255.255.0\\n!\\nrouter eigrp 1\\n network 199.1.1.0\\n network 199.1.10.0\\nExample I-2  Mount Pilot Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1 encapsulation frame-relay\\n ip address  199.1.1.2  255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address  199.1.11.2   255.255.255.0\\n!\\nrouter eigrp 1\\n network 199.1.1.0\\n network 199.1.11.0\\nExample I-3  Raleigh Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1 encapsulation frame-relay\\n ip address  199.1.1.3  255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address  199.1.12.3   255.255.255.0\\n!\\nrouter eigrp 1\\n network 199.1.1.0\\n network 199.1.12.0\\nThe configuration is simple in comparison with the protocol concepts.

Note that the IP addresses on \\nthe three routers’ serial interfaces are all in the same Class C network. Also, this simple con-\\nfiguration takes advantage of the following IOS default settings:\\n■The LMI type is automatically sensed.\\n■The (default) encapsulation is Cisco.\\n■PVC DLCIs are learned via LMI status messages.\\n■Inverse ARP is enabled (by default) and is triggered when a router receives an LMI status\\nmessage declaring that the VCs are up.\\nptg173963636\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nConfiguring the Encapsulation and LMI\\nIn many cases, using the defaults as listed with the first example works just fine. However, \\nfor the purpose of showing an alternative configuration, suppose that the following require-ments were added to the requirements surrounding the design in Figure I-1:\\n■The Raleigh router requires IETF encapsulation on both VCs.\\n■Mayberry’s LMI type should be ANSI, and LMI autosense should not be used.\\nTo change these defaults, the steps outlined as optional configuration Steps 3 and 4 in the configuration checklist should be used. Examples I-4 and I-5 show the changes that would be made to Mayberry and Raleigh.\\nExample I-4\\n Mayberry Configuration with New Requirements\\ninterface serial0/1/1\\n encapsulation frame-relay\\n frame-relay lmi-type ansi\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.3 53 ietf\\n ip address 199.1.1.1  255.255.255.0\\n! rest of configuration unchanged from Example I-1.\\nExample I-5  Raleigh Configuration with New Requirements\\ninterface serial0/1/1 encapsulation frame-relay ietf\\n ip address  199.1.1.3  255.255.255.0\\n! rest of configuration unchanged from Example I-3.\\nThese configurations differ from the previous ones (in Examples I-1 and I-3) in two ways. \\nFirst, Raleigh changed its encapsulation for both its PVCs with the ietf keyword on the \\nencapsulation command. This keyword applies to all VCs on the interface. However, \\nMayberry cannot change its encapsulation in the same way, because only one of the two \\nVCs terminating in Mayberry needs to use IETF encapsulation, and the other needs to use Cisco encapsulation. So, Mayberry is forced to code the frame-relay map command, ref-\\nerencing the DLCI for the VC to Raleigh, with the ietf keyword. With that command, you \\ncan change the encapsulation setting per VC, as opposed to the configuration on Raleigh, which changes the encapsulation for all VCs.\\nThe second major change is the LMI configuration. The LMI configuration in Mayberry \\nwould be fine without any changes because the default use of LMI autosense would rec-\\nognize ANSI as the LMI type. However, by coding the frame-relay lmi-type ansi interface \\nsubcommand, Mayberry must use ANSI, because this command not only sets the LMI type, but it also disables autosensing of the LMI type.\\nNOTE\\n The LMI setting is a per-physical-interface setting, even if subinterfaces are used, so \\nthe frame-relay lmi-type command is always a subcommand under the physical interface.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 7\\nMount Pilot needs to configure a frame-relay map command with the ietf keyword for its \\nVC to Raleigh, just like Mayberry. This change is not shown in the examples.\\nFrame Relay Address Mapping\\nFigure I-1 does not even bother listing the DLCIs used for the VCs. The earlier configura-\\ntions work as stated, and frankly, if you never knew the DLCIs, this network would work! However, for the exams, and for real networking jobs, engineers need to know the DLCIs, \\nand the process of Frame Relay mapping. \\nFrame Relay mapping matches a next-hop IP address that sits on the Frame Relay network \\nwith the right DLCI used to send frames to that next-hop device, with the same goal as ARP \\non a LAN. Figure I-2 shows the same network, this time with local DLCI values shown.\\nFrame Relay “mapping” creates a correlation between a Layer 3 address and its correspond-\\ning Layer 2 address. The concept is similar to the ARP cache for LAN interfaces. For exam-\\nple, the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache used on LANs is an example of Layer \\n3-to-Layer 2 address mapping. With IP ARP, you know the IP address of another device on the same LAN, but not the MAC address; when the ARP completes, you know another device’s LAN (Layer 2) address. Similarly, routers that use Frame Relay need a mapping \\nbetween a router’s Layer 3 address and the DLCI used to reach that other router.\\nRaleig h Mount Pilo t\\nSubnet 199.1.11 .0/24199.1.1.3 199.1.1.2\\nSubnet 199.1.12.0/2 4Subnet 199.1.10.0/24\\n199.1.1.1Mayberry\\nDLCI 53 DLCI 52\\nDLCI 51 DLCI 51\\nDLCI 53 DLCI 52\\nFigure I-2  Full Mesh with Local DLCIs Shown\\nThis section discusses the basics of why mapping is needed for LAN connections and Frame \\nRelay, with a focus on Frame Relay. Here’s a more general definition of mapping:\\nThe information that correlates to the next-hop router’s Layer 3 address and the Layer 2 \\naddress used to reach it is called mapping. Mapping is needed on multiaccess networks.\\nThinking about routing helps make the need for mapping more apparent. For example, con-\\nsider a packet that enters Mayberry’s LAN interface destined for network 199.1.11.0/24, \\nthe Class C network off Mount Pilot’s LAN interface. As shown in Figure I-3, the router \\ngoes through normal routing steps, removing the packet from between the Ethernet header \\nand trailer, choosing to route the packet out Mayberry’s S0/1/1 interface to Mount Pilot next, and so on. But what DLCI should Mayberry put into the new Frame Relay header? \\nptg173963638\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nMayberrySubnet\\n199.1.11.0/24Routing Table\\nMayberry TablesS0/1/1\\nS0/1/1199.1.1.1\\n199.1.1.2Local\\nDLCI 52\\nLocal\\nDLCI 51\\nMount Pilot\\nSubnet 199.1.11.0/24Eth Eth IP\\nIP\\nFR FR IPNext-Hop\\n199.1.1.2\\nNeighbor IP199.1.1.2\\nMapping TableDLCI52\\nFigure I-3  Logic on Mayberry to Choose the Correct DLCI\\nThe left side of the figure shows the tables Mayberry uses to choose the right DLCI. First, \\nMayberry looks at the route it uses to forward the packet, finding the next-hop router IP address. Then, the Frame Relay Mapping table lists that same next-hop router IP address, \\nalong with the DLCI used to send frames to that address (the equivalent of an ARP table). \\nMayberry then puts that DLCI (52, Mayberry’s local DLCI for the PVC connected to Mount Pilot) into the Frame Relay header. \\nInterestingly, just like ARP happens behind the scenes, without being enabled, Frame Relay \\ncreates the address mappings behind the scenes. Example I-6 puts the pieces together, matching Figure I-3. The example lists the routing table, the PVCs (including DLCIs), and the Frame Relay mapping table, all on Mayberry.\\nExample I-6\\n show  Commands on Mayberry, Showing the Need for Mapping  \\nMayberry# show ip route\\nCodes: L - local, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP\\nD - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2\\nE1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2\\ni - IS-IS, su - IS-IS summary, L1 - IS-IS level-1, L2 - IS-IS level-2\\nia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route\\no - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route, H - NHRP, l - LISP\\n+ - replicated route, % - next hop override\\nGateway of last resort is not set\\n199.1.1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks\\nC 199.1.1.0/24 is directly connected, Serial0/1/1L 199.1.1.1/32 is directly connected, Serial0/1/1\\n199.1.10.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 9\\nC 199.1.10.0/24 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nL 199.1.10.1/32 is directly connected, GigabitEthernet0/0\\nD     199.1.11.0/24 [90/2172416] via 199.1.1.2, 00:00:03, Serial0/1/1\\nD     199.1.12.0/24 [90/2172416] via 199.1.1.3, 00:19:14, Serial0/1/1\\nMayberry# show frame-relay pvc\\nPVC Statistics for interface Serial0/1/1 (Frame Relay DTE)\\nActive     Inactive Deleted Static\\n  Local 2 0 0 0\\n  Switched 0 0 0 0\\n  Unused 0 0 0 0\\nDLCI = 52, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/1/1  input pkts 37 output pkts 39 in bytes 2542\\n  out bytes 2752 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 26 out bcast bytes 1664\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  pvc create time 00:20:02, last time pvc status changed 00:20:02\\nDLCI = 53, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/1/1  input pkts 37 output pkts 37 in bytes 2618\\n  out bytes 2746 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 25 out bcast bytes 1630\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  pvc create time 00:20:02, last time pvc status changed 00:20:02\\nMayberry# show frame-relay map\\nSerial0/1/1 (up): ip 199.1.1.2 dlci 52(0x34,0xC40), dynamic,\\nbroadcast,, status defined, active\\nSerial0/1/1 (up): ip 199.1.1.3 dlci 53(0x35,0xC50), dynamic,\\nbroadcast,, status defined, active\\nptg1739636310\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nThe example highlights all the related information on Mayberry for sending packets to \\nnetwork 199.1.11.0/24 off Mount Pilot. Mayberry’s route to 199.1.11.0 refers to outgoing \\ninterface serial 0/1/1 and to 199.1.1.2 as the next-hop address. The show frame-relay pvc \\ncommand lists two DLCIs, 52 and 53, and both are active. How does Mayberry know the DLCIs? Well, the LMI status messages tell Mayberry about the VCs, the associated DLCIs, and the status (active).\\nWhich DLCI should Mayberry use to forward the packet? The show frame-relay map com-\\nmand output holds the answer. Notice the highlighted phrase “ip 199.1.1.2 dlci 52” in the \\noutput. Somehow, Mayberry has mapped 199.1.1.2, which is the next-hop address in the route, to the correct local DLCI, which is 52. So, Mayberry knows to use local DLCI 52 to \\nreach next-hop IP address 199.1.1.2.\\nMayberry can use two methods to build the mapping shown in Example I-6. One uses a \\nstatically configured mapping, and the other uses a dynamic process called Inverse ARP. \\nThe next two small sections explain the details of each of these options.\\nInverse ARP\\nInverse ARP dynamically creates a mapping between the Layer 3 address (for example, the IP address) and the Layer 2 address (the local DLCI). The end result of Inverse ARP is the same as IP ARP on a LAN: The router builds a mapping between a neighboring Layer 3 \\naddress and the corresponding Layer 2 address. However, the process used by Inverse ARP \\ndiffers for ARP on a LAN. After the VC is up, each router announces its network layer address by sending an Inverse ARP message over that VC. Figure I-4 shows how this works.\\nMayberry Mount Pilot\\nDLCI 52 DLCI 51\\nStatus: DLCI 52 Up Status: DLCI 51 Up\\nI-ARP I Am 199.1.1.2 (IP)I-ARP I Am 199.1.1.1  (IP)199.1.1.1 199.1.1.2\\nFigure I-4  Inverse ARP Process\\nAs shown in Figure I-4, Inverse ARP announces its Layer 3 addresses as soon as the LMI signals that the PVCs are up. Inverse ARP starts by learning the DLCI data link layer address (via LMI messages), and then it announces its own Layer 3 addresses that use that VC. \\nInverse ARP is enabled by default.\\nIn Example I-6, Mayberry shows two different entries in the show frame-relay map \\ncommand output. Mayberry uses Inverse ARP to learn that DLCI 52 is mapped to next-\\nhop IP address 199.1.1.2, and that DLCI 53 is mapped to next-hop IP address 199.1.1.3. Interestingly, Mayberry learns this information by receiving an Inverse ARP from Mount Pilot and Raleigh, respectively.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 11\\nThe Inverse ARP process has a few subtle turns of how it works. First, Inverse ARP mes-\\nsages announce a router’s IP address, with the frame flowing over a PVC. The receiving router learns the IP address in the message, and it notes the DLCI of the InARP frame. For \\nexample, based on Figure I-4:\\n■Mayberry sends an InARP with 199.1.1.1; Mount Pilot receives the InARP with DLCI 51\\nin the header, so Mount Pilot’s mapping lists 199.1.1.1 and DLCI 51.\\n■Mount Pilot sends an InARP with 199.1.1.2; Mayberry receive the InARP with DLCI 52\\nin the header, so Mayberry’s mapping lists 199.1.1.2 and DLCI 52.\\nStatic Frame Relay Mapping\\nYou can statically configure the same mapping information instead of using Inverse ARP. \\nIn a production network, you probably would just go ahead and use Inverse ARP. For the exams, you need to know how to configure the static map command statements. Example \\nI-7 lists the static Frame Relay map for the three routers shown in Figure I-2, along with the configuration used to disable Inverse ARP.\\nExample I-7\\n frame-relay map  Commands  \\nMayberry\\ninterface serial 0/1/1\\n no frame-relay inverse-arp\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.2 52 broadcast\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.3 53 broadcast\\nMount Pilot\\ninterface serial 0/1/1\\n no frame-relay inverse-arp\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.1 51 broadcast\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.3 53 broadcast\\nRaleigh\\ninterface serial 0/1/1 no frame-relay inverse-arp\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.1 51 broadcast\\n frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.2 52 broadcast\\nAs an example to better understand the meaning of the frame-relay map command, con-\\nsider the command on Mayberry referencing 199.1.1.2. The command sits on Mayberry, so \\nit adds a mapping entry in Mayberry. The command tells Mayberry that when Mayberry \\nsends a packet to 199.1.1.2 (Mount Pilot), Mayberry must use DLCI 52. Mayberry’s frame-\\nrelay map statement correlates Mount Pilot’s IP address, 199.1.1.2, to the local DLCI used \\nto reach Mount Pilot—namely, DLCI 52. \\nAs another example, consider Mount Pilot’s frame-relay map ip 199.1.1.1 51 broadcast \\ncommand. This command creates a mapping entry for Mount Pilot, so when it sends a pack-\\net to 199.1.1.1 (Mayberry), Mount Pilot uses DLCI 51. \\nMapping is needed for each next-hop Layer 3 address for each Layer 3 protocol being rout-\\ned. Even with a network this small, the configuration process can be laborious.\\nptg1739636312\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nNOTE  The broadcast keyword on the frame-relay map command is required when the \\nrouter needs to send broadcasts or multicasts to the neighboring router—for example, to \\nsupport routing protocol messages such as Hellos.\\nConfiguring Point-to-Point Subinterfaces \\nThe second sample network, based on the environment shown in Figure I-5, uses point-to-point subinterfaces. Point-to-point subinterfaces work well when the subnetting design calls for one subnet for each PVC. Examples I-8 through I-11 show the configuration for \\nthis sample network, with all four routers using only point-to-point subinterfaces. Pay close \\nattention to the command prompts in Example I-8, because they change when you config-ure subinterfaces.\\nS0/1/1140.1.1.0/24140.1.3.0/24\\nS0/1/1140.1.2.0/24\\nS0/1/1\\n140.1.12.0/24DLCI 51 DLCI 51 DLCI 51DLCI\\n53\\n140.1.14.0/24140.1.11.0/24\\nCharlotte\\n140.1.13.0/24BostonFrame Relay\\nPartial MeshAtlanta\\nNashvilleDLCI 52 DLCI 54\\nFigure I-5  Partial Mesh with Subnets and Local DLCIs\\nExample I-8  Atlanta  Configuration\\nAtlanta(config)# interface serial0/1/1\\nAtlanta(config-if)# encapsulation frame-relay\\nAtlanta(config-if)# interface serial 0/1/1.1 point-to-point\\nAtlanta(config-subif)# ip address 140.1.1.1  255.255.255.0\\nAtlanta(config-subif)# frame-relay interface-dlci 52\\nAtlanta(config-fr-dlci)# interface serial 0/1/1.2 point-to-point\\nAtlanta(config-subif)# ip address 140.1.2.1 255.255.255.0Atlanta(config-subif)# frame-relay interface-dlci 53\\nAtlanta(config-fr-dlci)# interface serial 0/1/1.3 point-to-point\\nAtlanta(config-subif)# ip address 140.1.3.1 255.255.255.0Atlanta(config-subif)# frame-relay interface-dlci 54\\nAtlanta(config-fr-dlci)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0\\nAtlanta(config-if)# ip address 140.1.11.1 255.255.255.0\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 13\\nExample I-9  Charlotte Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1\\n encapsulation frame-relay\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/1/1.1 point-to-point\\n ip address 140.1.1.2  255.255.255.0\\n frame-relay interface-dlci 51\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address 140.1.12.2 255.255.255.0\\nExample I-10  Nashville Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1\\n encapsulation frame-relay\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/1/1.2 point-to-point\\n ip address 140.1.2.3 255.255.255.0\\n frame-relay interface-dlci 51\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\n ip address 140.1.13.3 255.255.255.0\\nExample I-11  Boston Configuration\\ninterface serial0/1/1\\nencapsulation frame-relay\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/1/1.3 point-to-point\\nip address 140.1.3.4 255.255.255.0\\nframe-relay interface-dlci 51\\n!\\ninterface gigabitethernet 0/0\\nip address 140.1.14.4  255.255.255.0\\nAgain, defaults abound in this configuration, but some defaults are different than when \\nyou’re configuring on the physical interface. The LMI type is autosensed, and Cisco encap-sulation is used, which is just like the fully meshed examples. Inverse ARP is not really \\nneeded on point-to-point subinterfaces, but it is enabled by default in case the router on \\nthe other end of the VC needs to use Inverse ARP, as explained later in this section.\\nTwo new commands create the configuration required with point-to-point subinterfaces. \\nFirst, the interface serial 0/1/1.1 point-to-point command creates logical subinterface \\nnumber 1 under physical interface serial 0/1/1. This command also defines the subinterface as a point-to-point subinterface instead of point-to-multipoint. Then, the configuration must \\nassociate one PVC with the subinterface; the frame-relay interface-dlci subinterface sub-\\ncommand tells the router which single local DLCI is associated with that subinterface.\\nptg1739636314\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nAn example of how the frame-relay interface-dlci command works can help. Consider \\nrouter Atlanta in Figure I-5. Atlanta receives LMI messages on serial 0/1/1 stating that three \\nPVCs, with local DLCIs 52, 53, and 54, are up. Which PVC goes with which subinterface? \\nCisco IOS software needs to associate the correct PVC with the correct subinterface. This is \\naccomplished with the frame-relay interface-dlci command.\\nTake a moment to work through all the subinterface configuration and frame-relay  \\ninterface-dlci configuration in Examples I-8 through I-11, and compare it to the DLCIs \\nand IP subnets listed in Figure I-5. Note that in each case the local DLCI configured on the frame-relay interface-dlci command corresponds to the subnet (based on the ip address \\ncommand).\\nBefore leaving the point-to-point configuration, note that the subinterface numbers do not \\nhave to match on the router on the other end of the PVC. In this example, I just numbered the subinterfaces to be easier to remember. In real life, it is useful to encode some informa-\\ntion about your network numbering scheme into the subinterface number. \\nFor example, a company might encode part of the carrier’s circuit ID in the subinterface \\nnumber so that the operations staff could find the correct information to tell the telco when \\ntroubleshooting the link. Many sites use the DLCI as the subinterface number. Of course, \\nuseful troubleshooting information, such as the DLCI, the name of the router on the other end of the VC, and so on, could be configured as text with the description command as \\nwell. In any case, there are no requirements for matching subinterface numbers. This exam-ple just matches the subinterface number to the third octet of the IP address.\\nVerifying Point-to-Point Frame Relay\\nExample I-12 shows the output from the most popular Cisco IOS software Frame Relay EXEC commands for monitoring Frame Relay as issued on router Atlanta.\\nExample I-12\\n Output from EXEC Commands on Atlanta  \\nAtlanta# show frame-relay pvc\\nPVC Statistics for interface Serial0/1/1 (Frame Relay DTE)\\nActive     Inactive Deleted Static\\n  Local 2 0 0 0\\n  Switched 0 0 0 0\\n  Unused 1 0 0 0\\nDLCI = 52, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/1/1  input pkts 80 output pkts 76 in bytes 5940\\n  out bytes 5594 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 45 out bcast bytes 3030\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 15\\n  pvc create time 00:39:49, last time pvc status changed 00:27:29\\nDLCI = 53, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/1/1  input pkts 64 output pkts 82 in bytes 4206\\n  out bytes 6612 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 38 out bcast bytes 2532\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  pvc create time 00:33:49, last time pvc status changed 00:27:19\\nDLCI = 54, DLCI USAGE = UNUSED, PVC STATUS = ACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/1/1  input pkts 0 output pkts 0 in bytes 0\\n  out bytes 0 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 0 out bcast bytes 0 5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, \\n0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  pvc create time 00:00:59, last time pvc status changed 00:00:59\\nAtlanta# show frame-relay map\\nSerial0/0/0.3 (up): point-to-point dlci, dlci 54(0x36,0xC60), broadcast\\nstatus defined, active\\nSerial0/0/0.2 (up): point-to-point dlci, dlci 53(0x35,0xC50), broadcast\\nstatus defined, active\\nSerial0/0/0.1 (up): point-to-point dlci, dlci 52(0x34,0xC40), broadcast\\nstatus defined, active\\nAtlanta# debug frame-relay lmiFrame Relay LMI debugging is on\\nDisplaying all Frame Relay LMI data\\nSerial0/0/0(out): StEnq, myseq 163, yourseen 161, DTE up\\ndatagramstart = 0x45AED8, datagramsize = 13\\nFR encap = 0xFCF10309\\n00 75 01 01 01 03 02 A3 A1\\nSerial0/0/0(in): Status, myseq 163\\nRT IE 1, length 1, type 1\\nKA IE 3, length 2, yourseq 162, myseq 163\\nptg1739636316\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nThe show frame-relay pvc command lists useful management information. In particular, the \\noutput includes a variety of counters and rates for packets going over each permanent vir-\\ntual circuit (PVC). Also, the PVC status is a great place to start when troubleshooting.\\nThe show frame-relay map command lists mapping information. With the earlier example \\nof a fully meshed network, in which the configuration did not use any subinterfaces, a \\nLayer 3 address was listed with each DLCI. In this example, a DLCI is listed in each entry, \\nbut no mention of corresponding Layer 3 addresses is made. The whole point of mapping \\nis to correlate a Layer 3 address to a Layer 2 address, but there is no Layer 3 address in the show frame-relay map command output! The reason is that with point-to-point subinter-faces routers can find the correct mapping information just from the local configuration, as \\nfollows:\\n■A router matches a route that forwards packets out a point-to-point subinterface.\\n■The router looks for the one (and only) frame-relay interface-dlci configuration com-\\nmand on that subinterface and uses that DLCI when encapsulating the packet.\\nFinally, the debug frame-relay lmi output lists information for the sending and receiving of \\nLMI inquiries. The switch sends the status message, and the data terminal equipment (DTE) \\n(router) sends the status inquiry. The default setting with Cisco IOS software is to send, and \\nto expect to receive, these status messages. The Cisco IOS software no keepalive command \\nis used to disable the use of LMI status messages. Unlike other interfaces, Cisco keepalive \\nmessages do not flow from router to router over Frame Relay. Instead, they are simply used to detect whether the router has connectivity to its local Frame Relay switch.\\nConfiguring with Multipoint Subinterfaces \\nYou can also choose to use multipoint subinterfaces for a Frame Relay configuration. This last sample network, based on the network shown in Figure I-6, uses both multipoint and point-to-point subinterfaces. Examples I-13 through I-17 show the configuration for this \\nnetwork.

On \\nrouters A, B, and C, a multipoint subinterface is used for the configuration referencing the \\nother two routers, because you can think of these three routers as forming a fully meshed subset of the network.\\nThe term multipoint simply means that there is more than one VC, so you can send and \\nreceive to and from more than one VC on the subinterface. Like point-to-point subinter-\\nfaces, multipoint subinterfaces use the frame-relay interface-dlci command. Notice that \\nthere are two commands for each multipoint subinterface in this case, because each of the two PVCs associated with this subinterface must be identified as being used with that sub-\\ninterface.\\nRouter A is the only router using both multipoint and point-to-point subinterfaces. On \\nrouter A’s multipoint serial 0/1/1.1 interface, DLCIs for router B and router C are listed. On \\nrouter A’s other two subinterfaces, which are point-to-point, only a single DLCI needs to be \\nlisted. In fact, only one frame-relay interface-dlci command is allowed on a point-to-point \\nsubinterface because only one VC is allowed. Otherwise, the configurations between the two types are similar.\\nNo mapping statements are required for the configurations shown in Examples I-13 through \\nI-17 because Inverse ARP is enabled on the multipoint subinterfaces by default. No map -\\nping is ever needed for the point-to-point subinterface because the only DLCI associated \\nwith the interface is statically configured with the frame-relay interface-dlci command.\\nExample I-18 lists another show frame-relay map command, showing the mapping informa-\\ntion learned by Inverse ARP for the multipoint subinterface. Notice that the output now \\nincludes the Layer 3 addresses, whereas the same command when using point-to-point sub-interfaces (in Example I-12) did not. The router needs mapping information on multipoint subinterfaces so that when the router routes packets out that subinterface, the router can choose the correct DLCI to use when encapsulating the packet.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 19\\nExample I-18  Frame Relay Maps and Inverse ARP on Router C\\nRouterC# show frame-relay map\\nSerial0/1/1.1 (up): ip 140.1.1.1 dlci 501(0x1F5,0x7C50), dynamic,\\nbroadcast,, status defined, active\\nSerial0/1/1.1 (up): ip 140.1.1.2 dlci 502(0x1F6,0x7C60), dynamic,\\nbroadcast,, status defined, active\\nOSPF Issues on Frame Relay Multipoint and Physical Interfaces\\nIn many enterprise networks that use Frame Relay, the engineers choose to use only point-\\nto-point subinterfaces for Frame Relay. Many Frame Relay WANs connect remote sites to \\na central site, so the point-to-point model works well. Also, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) \\nand Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) both work well with default set-\\ntings over point-to-point Frame Relay subinterfaces.\\nAs it turns out, OSPF requires a little more configuration attention when using Frame Relay \\nconfigurations with multipoint or physical interfaces. This brief section summarizes the \\nissues.\\nRouters using OSPF do not become neighbors over a Frame Relay physical interface or \\na multipoint subinterface if using only the OSPF configuration discussed in Chapter 8, \\n“Implementing OSPF for IPv4.” The issue? Frame Relay physical and multipoint subinter-faces, by default, use an OSPF network type of nonbroadcast. This OSPF network type means that the router will not attempt to dynamically discover any OSPF neighbors on that \\ninterface.\\nThe OSPF problem has multiple solutions, but the simplest is to just change OSPF to use \\na different OSPF network type on the Frame Relay interfaces. (Chapter 8 introduced the \\nidea of OSPF network types for interfaces, but you needed knowledge about Frame Relay \\nbefore learning about this one small issue and its solution.) The specific solution: Change the OSPF network type to point-to-multipoint, which lets the routers dynamically discover each other over the physical or multipoint subinterface.\\nFor instance, the previous examples (Examples I-13, I-14, and I-15) showed routers A, B, \\nand C all using a multipoint subinterface and sharing the same subnet. If using OSPF, all three routers should become OSPF neighbors. To make OSPF work between those routers, besides the expected OSPF configuration to enable OSPF on the multipoint subinterface of \\neach route, use the ip ospf network point-to-multipoint command on all three router’s mul-\\ntipoint subinterface. This command changes the OSPF network type to point-to-multipoint, \\nwhich tells each router to dynamically discover neighbors (and to not use a designated  \\nrouter/backup designated router [DR/BDR]).\\nNOTE\\n Study tip: When reading this chapter for the first time, take a break before moving \\ninto this troubleshooting section. Take some time to practice Frame Relay configuration \\nusing whatever lab choice you made (real gear, simulator, and so on).\\nptg1739636320\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nFrame Relay Troubleshooting\\nFrame Relay has many features and options that you can configure. For both real life and \\nthe exams, troubleshooting Frame Relay problems often means that you need to look at all the routers’ configurations and make sure that the configurations meet the requirements. \\nThe LMI types must match or be autosensed, the Layer 3 mapping information must be \\nlearned or statically mapped, the right DLCI values must be associated with each subin-terface, and so on. So, to be well prepared for the CCNA exams, you should review and memorize the many Frame Relay configuration options and what each option means.\\nHowever, the exams may have Frame Relay questions that require you to determine a prob-\\nlem without looking at the configuration. This second major section of the chapter exam-ines Frame Relay troubleshooting, with an emphasis on how to use show commands, along \\nwith the symptoms of a problem to isolate the root cause of the problem.\\nA Suggested Frame Relay Troubleshooting Process\\nTo isolate a Frame Relay problem, the process should start with some pings. Optimally, pings from an end-user host on a LAN to another host on a remote LAN can quickly determine whether the network currently can meet the true end goal of delivering packets \\nbetween computers. If that ping fails, a ping from one router to the other router’s Frame \\nRelay IP address is the next step. If that ping works, but the end user’s ping failed, the problem probably has something to do with Layer 3 issues (troubleshooting those issues was well covered in Chapters 4, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Part I,” 5, “Troubleshooting \\nIPv4 Routing Part II,” and 11, “Troubleshooting IPv4 Routing Protocols”). However, if a \\nping from one router to another router’s Frame Relay IP address fails, the problem is most likely related to the Frame Relay network.\\nThis section focuses on troubleshooting problems when a Frame Relay router cannot ping \\nanother router’s Frame Relay IP address. At that point, the engineer should ping the Frame Relay IP addresses of all the other routers on the other end of each VC to determine the following:\\nDo the pings fail for all remote routers’ Frame Relay IP addresses or do some pings fail \\nand some pings work?\\nFor example, Figure I-7 shows a sample Frame Relay network that will be used with the \\nremaining examples in this chapter. If R1 tried to ping R2’s Frame Relay IP address (10.1.2.2 \\nin this case) and failed, the next question is whether R1’s pings to R3 (10.1.34.3) and R4 (10.1.34.4) work.\\nThis chapter organizes its explanations of how to troubleshoot Frame Relay based on this \\nfirst problem isolation step. The following list summarizes the major actions, with each step \\nin the following list being examined in order following the list.\\nIf a Frame Relay router’s pings fail for all remote routers whose VCs share a single access \\nlink, do the following:\\nStep 1.\\n Check for Layer 1 problems on the access link between the router and the \\nlocal Frame Relay switch (all routers).\\nStep 2.

Check for other Layer 3 issues, including mismatched subnets.\\nThe rest of this chapter explains some of the details of each step of this suggested trouble-shooting process.\\nLayer 1 Issues on the Access Link (Step 1)\\nIf a router’s physical interface used for the Frame Relay access link is not in an “up and up” state, the router cannot send any frames over the link. If the interface has a line status (the first interface status code) of down, the interface most likely has a Layer 1 issue.\\nFrom a Layer 1 perspective, a Frame Relay access link is merely a leased line between \\na router and a Frame Relay switch. As such, the exact same Layer 1 issues exist for this link as for a point-to-point leased line. Because the possible root causes and suggested \\ntroubleshooting steps mirror what should be done on a leased line, refer to the section \\n“Troubleshooting Layer 1 Problems” in Chapter 12, “Implementing Point-to-Point WANs,” \\nfor more information about this step.\\nptg1739636322\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nLayer 2 Issues on the Access Link (Step 2)\\nIf a router’s physical interface line status is up, but the line protocol status (second status \\ncode) is down, the link usually has a Layer 2 problem between the router and the local Frame Relay switch. With Frame Relay interfaces, the problem is often related to either the  \\nencapsulation command or the Frame Relay LMI.\\nThe potential problem related to the encapsulation command is simple to check. If a rout-\\ner’s serial interface configuration omits the encapsulation frame-relay interface subcom-\\nmand but the physical access link is working, the physical interface settles into an up/down \\nstate. If the configuration is unavailable, the show interfaces command can be used to see \\nthe configured encapsulation type, which is listed in the first few lines of command output.\\nThe other potential problem relates to the LMI. LMI status messages flow in both directions \\nbetween a router (data terminating equipment [DTE]) and Frame Relay switch (data circuit-terminating equipment [DCE]) for two main purposes:\\n■For the DCE to inform the DTE about each VC’s DLCI and its status\\n■To provide a keepalive function so that the DTE and DCE can easily tell when the access\\nlink can no longer pass traffic\\nA router places the physical link in an up/down state when the link physically works, but \\nthe router ceases to hear LMI messages from the switch. With the interface not in an  \\nup/up state, the router does not attempt to send any IP packets out the interface, so all pings should fail at this point.\\nA router might cease to receive LMI messages from the switch because of both legitimate \\nreasons and mistakes. The normal legitimate purpose for the LMI keepalive function is that if the link really is having problems, and cannot pass any data, the router can notice the loss \\nof keepalive messages and bring the link down. This allows the router to use an alternative \\nroute, assuming that an alternative route exists. However, a router might cease to receive LMI messages and bring down the interface because of the following mistakes:\\n■Disabling LMI on the switch, but leaving it enabled on the router\\n■Configuring different LMI types on the router (with the frame-relay lmi-type type phys-\\nical interface subcommand) and the switch, so that the router and Frame Relay switch do\\nnot understand each other’s LMI messages\\nYou can easily check for both encapsulation and LMI using the show frame-relay lmi com-\\nmand. This command lists output for interfaces only if the interface has the encapsulation \\nframe-relay command configured, so you can quickly confirm whether the encapsulation \\nframe-relay command is configured on the correct serial interfaces. This command also lists \\nthe LMI type used by the router, and it shows counters for the number of LMI messages \\nsent and received. Example I-19 shows an example from router R1 in Figure I-7.\\nExample I-19  show frame-relay lmi Command on R1\\nR1# show frame-relay lmi\\nLMI Statistics for interface Serial0/0/0 (Frame Relay DTE) LMI TYPE = ANSI\\n  Invalid Unnumbered info 0             Invalid Prot Disc 0\\n  Invalid dummy Call Ref 0              Invalid Msg Type 0\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 23\\n  Invalid Status Message 0 Invalid Lock Shift 0\\n  Invalid Information ID 0 Invalid Report IE Len 0\\n  Invalid Report Request 0 Invalid Keep IE Len 0\\n  Num Status Enq.

At the point in time that \\nthe configuration was changed, the statistics for the number of sent and received status \\nmessages were both at 34. (When working, these numbers will grow at the same rate.) From \\nthat point forward, R1 has now sent 88 ANSI status messages, for a total of 122 status mes-sages sent. The number of status messages received still sits at 34, because R1 no longer understands the Cisco LMI messages sent by the switch. Also, R1 has been expecting an \\nANSI status message for the last 88 LMI status time intervals, as noted in the status timeouts \\ncounter.\\nIf repeated use of the show frame-relay lmi command shows that the number of status \\nmessages received remains the same, the likely cause, other than a truly nonworking link, is \\nthat the LMI types do not match. The best solution is to allow for LMI autosense by config-uring the no frame-relay lmi-type physical interface subcommand. Alternatively, configure \\nthe same LMI type that is used by the switch.\\nIf you troubleshoot and fix any problems found in Steps 1 and 2 on all Frame Relay con-\\nnected routers, all the routers’ access link physical interfaces should be in an up/up state. The last four steps examine issues that apply to individual PVCs and neighbors.\\nPVC Problems and Status (Step 3)\\nThe goal at this step in the troubleshooting process is to discover the DLCI of the PVC used to reach a particular neighbor, and then find out if the PVC is working. \\nTo determine the correct PVC, particularly if little or no configuration or documentation \\nis available, you have to start with the failed ping command for the neighboring router’s IP address on the Frame Relay network. From there, you can follow this chain of logic:\\nStep 3a.\\n Discover the IP address and mask of each Frame Relay interface/subinterface \\n(show interfaces, show ip interface brief) and calculate the connected subnets.\\nStep 3b.  Compare  the IP address of the neighbor (from the failed ping command) and \\npick the local interface/subinterface whose connected subnet is the same \\nsubnet.\\nStep 3c.  Discover the PVCs assigned to that interface or subinterface ( show \\nframe-relay pvc).\\nStep 3d.  If more than one PVC is assigned to the interface or subinterface, determine \\nwhich PVC is used to reach a particular neighbor (show frame-relay map).\\nptg1739636324\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nNOTE  As a reminder, lists like this one are meant for convenient reference when you read \\nthe chapter. It is easy to find the list when you study and want to remember a particular part \\nof how to attack a given problem. You do not need to memorize the list or practice it until you internalize the information.\\nSteps 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d discover the correct PVC to examine. After it is discovered, Step 3 in the suggested troubleshooting process interprets the status of that PVC, and the associ-ated interface or subinterface, to determine the cause of any problems.\\nThis section takes a closer look at an example in which R1 cannot ping R2’s 10.1.2.2 Frame \\nRelay IP address from Figure I-7. Before focusing on the process to determine which VC is used, it is helpful to see the final answer, so Figure I-8 lists some of the details. For this \\nexample, R1’s ping 10.1.2.2 command fails in this case.\\nR1 Routing Table\\nR1 Configuration\\ninterface S0/0/0.2 point-to-point\\n  ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.0  frame-relay interface-dlci 102\\nDLCI 102\\nS0/0/0S0/0/0\\n10.1.2.2 /24Subnet Out-Int.

Any time you ping the Frame Relay IP address of a neighboring router, that IP \\naddress should be in one of the subnets also connected to the local router. To find the \\ninterface used on a local router when forwarding packets to the remote router, you just have to find that common connected subnet.\\nIn this example, with R1 pinging 10.1.2.2, Example I-20 shows a few commands that con-\\nfirm that R1’s S0/0/0.2 subinterface is connected to subnet 10.1.2.0/24, which includes R2’s 10.1.2.2 IP address.\\nExample I-20\\n Finding Subnet 10.1.2.0/24 and Subinterface S0/0/0.2  \\nR1> show ip interface brief\\nInterface             IP-Address OK?

In this case, S0/0/0.2 is listed with only one PVC, the one with DLCI 102, so only one PVC is associated with S0/0/0.2 in this case.\\nDetermine Which PVC Is Used to Reach a Particular Neighbor (Step 3d)\\nIf the router’s configuration associates more than one PVC with one interface or subinter-face, the next step is to figure out which of the PVCs is used to send traffic to a particular neighbor. For instance, Example I-21 shows R1 uses a multipoint subinterface S0/0/0.34 \\nwith DLCIs 103 and 104. So, if you were troubleshooting a problem in which the ping \\n10.1.34.3 command failed on R1, the next step would be to determine which of the two \\nDLCIs (103 or 104) identifies the VC connecting R1 to R3.\\nUnfortunately, you cannot always find the answer without looking at other documentation. \\nThe only show command that can help is show frame-relay map, which can correlate the \\nnext-hop IP address and DLCI. Unfortunately, if the local router relies on Inverse ARP, the local router cannot learn the mapping information right now either, so the mapping table \\nmight not have any useful information in it. However, if static mapping is used, the correct \\nPVC/DLCI can be identified.\\nIn the example of R1 failing when pinging 10.1.2.2 (R2), only one PVC is associated with \\nthe correct interface (S0/0/0.2). As a result, this example ignores this step and moves on to \\nlook at PVC status.\\nPVC Status\\nAt this point in major troubleshooting Step 3, the correct outgoing interface/subinterface \\nand correct PVC/DLCI have been identified. Finally, the PVC status can be examined to see if it means that the PVC has a problem.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 27\\nRouters use four different PVC status codes. A router learns about two of the possible \\nstatus values, active and inactive, via LMI messages from the Frame Relay switch. The \\nswitch’s LMI message lists all DLCIs for all configured PVCs on the access link and whether \\nthe PVC is currently usable (active) or not (inactive). An LMI message that lists these states \\nmeans:\\nActive: The Frame Relay network knows about the PVC with the listed DLCI, and the \\nPVC is working right now.\\nInactive: The Frame Relay network knows about the PVC with the listed DLCI, and the \\nPVC is not working right now.\\nRouters have two other PVC states that require a little more thought to understand. First, \\nthe static state means that the router has configured a DLCI for some PVC but the LMI \\nis down. Because the LMI is down, the router does not know whether the PVC will work, \\nbecause the router receives no LMI status messages. However, the router can at least send frames using those DLCIs and hope that the Frame Relay network can deliver them.\\nThe other PVC state, deleted, means that the router configuration refers to the DLCI, but \\nthe LMI is working and lists no information about that DLCI value. The LMI status mes-\\nsages list status for all the PVCs defined over the access link, so this state means that the Frame Relay network does not have a definition for the PVC. Basically, this state means that the router has configured the DLCI but the switch has not. \\nTable I-2 summarizes the four Frame Relay PVC status codes.\\nTab\\nle I-2  PVC Status Values\\nStatus Active Inactive Deleted Static\\nThe PVC is defined to the \\nFrame Relay network.Ye s Ye s No Unknown\\nThe router will attempt to send \\nframes on a VC in this state.Ye s No No Ye s\\nAs noted in the last row of the table, routers only send data over PVCs in an active or static \\nstate. Also even if the PVC is in a static state, there is no guarantee that the Frame Relay network can actually send frames over that PVC, because the static state implies that LMI is \\nturned off and that the router has not learned any status information.\\nThe next step in the troubleshooting process is to find the status of the PVC used to reach \\na particular neighbor. Continuing with the problem of R1 failing when pinging R2 (10.1.2.2), \\nExample I-22 shows the status of the PVC with DLCI 102, as identified earlier.\\nExample I-22\\n show frame-relay pvc Command on R1\\nR1> show frame-relay pvc 102\\nPVC Statistics for interface Serial0/0/0 (Frame Relay DTE)\\nDLCI = 102, DLCI USAGE = LOCAL, PVC STATUS = INACTIVE, INTERFACE = Serial0/0/0.2\\n  input pkts 22 output pkts 193 in bytes 1256\\n  out bytes 16436 dropped pkts 0 in pkts dropped 0\\nptg1739636328\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\n  out pkts dropped 0 out bytes dropped 0\\n  in FECN pkts 0 in BECN pkts 0 out FECN pkts 0\\n  out BECN pkts 0 in DE pkts 0 out DE pkts 0\\n  out bcast pkts 187 out bcast bytes 16032\\n  5 minute input rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  5 minute output rate 0 bits/sec, 0 packets/sec\\n  pvc create time 01:12:56, last time pvc status changed 00:22:45\\nIn this case, R1 cannot ping R2 because the PVC with DLCI 102 is in an inactive state.\\nTo further isolate the problem and find the root cause, you need to look deeper into the \\nreasons why a PVC can be in an inactive state. First, as always, repeat the same trouble-shooting steps on the other router (in this case, R2). If no problems are found on R2, other than an inactive PVC, the problem may be a genuine problem in the Frame Relay provider’s network, so a call to the provider may be the next step. However, you may find some other \\nproblem on the remote router. For example, to create the failure and show commands in \\nthis section, R2’s access link was shut down, so a quick examination of troubleshooting Step \\n1 on router R2 would have identified the problem. However, if further troubleshooting shows that both routers list their ends of the PVC in an inactive state, the root cause (in this \\ncase) lies within the Frame Relay provider’s network.\\nFinding the root cause of a problem related to a PVC in a deleted state is relatively easy. \\nThe deleted status means that the Frame Relay switch’s configuration and the router’s con-\\nfiguration do not match, with the router configuring a DLCI that is not also configured on \\nthe switch. Either the provider said it would configure a PVC with a particular DLCI and did not, or the router engineer configured the wrong DLCI value.\\nSubinterface Status\\nSubinterfaces have a line status and protocol status code, just like physical interfaces. However, because subinterfaces are virtual, the status codes and their meanings differ a bit from physical interfaces. This section briefly examines how Frame Relay subinterfaces work \\nand how IOS decides whether a Frame Relay subinterface should be in an up/up state or a \\ndown/down state.\\nFrame Relay configuration associates one or more DLCIs with a subinterface using two \\ncommands: frame-relay interface-dlci and frame-relay map. Of all the DLCIs associated \\nwith a subinterface, IOS uses the following rules to determine the status of a subinterface:\\n■Down/down: All the DLCIs associated with the subinterface are inactive or deleted, or\\nthe underlying physical interface is not in an up/up state.\\n■Up/up: At least one of the DLCIs associated with the subinterface is active or static.\\nFor example, to cause the problems shown in Example I-22, R2 and R3 simply shut down \\ntheir Frame Relay access links. Figure I-9 shows the next LMI status message that switch S1 \\nsends to R1.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 29\\nR1R2\\nR3\\nR4S1S2\\nS3S0/0/0.2 Point-to-Point\\nDLCI 102\\nS0/0/0.34 Multipoint\\nDLCI 103, 104\\nFigure I-9  Results of Shutting Down R2 and R3 Access Links\\nAs shown in the figure, R1 uses a point-to-point subinterface (S0/0/0.2) for the VC con-\\nnecting to R2 and a multipoint subinterface (S0/0/0.34) associated with the VCs to R3 and R4 (103 and 104, respectively). Earlier, the beginning of Example I-20 shows that S0/0/0.2 \\nis in a down/down state; the reason is that the only DLCI associated with the subinterface \\n(102) is inactive. However, S0/0/0.34 has two DLCIs, one of which is active, so IOS leaves S0/0/0.34 in an up/up state.\\nIt is useful to look at the subinterface status when troubleshooting, but keep in mind that \\njust because a subinterface is up, if it is a multipoint subinterface the up/up state does not necessarily mean that all DLCIs associated with the subinterface are working.\\nFrame Relay Mapping Issues (Step 4)\\nIf you follow the first three steps of the troubleshooting process suggested in this chap-ter and resolve the problems at each step, at this point each router’s access link interfaces should be in an up/up state, and the PVC between the two routers should be in an active (or \\nstatic) state. If the routers still cannot ping each other’s Frame Relay IP addresses, the next \\nthing to check is the Frame Relay address mapping information, which maps DLCIs to next-hop IP addresses.\\nThis section does not repeat the detailed coverage of address mapping that appears in \\nthis chapter. However, for perspective, the following list points out some tips and hints as reminders when you perform this troubleshooting step:\\nOn point-to-point subinterfaces:\\n■These subinterfaces do not need Inverse ARP or static mapping.\\n■IOS automatically maps any other IP addresses in the same subnet as a point-to-point\\nsubinterface as being reachable via the only DLCI on the subinterface.\\n■The show frame-relay map command output does list point-to-point subinterfaces,\\nbut with no next-hop IP address and no “dynamic” notation (which would imply InARP\\nlearned the mapping).\\nptg1739636330\\u2002 \\u2002 CCNA \\u2002Routing \\u2002and\\u2002Switching \\u2002ICND2 \\u2002200-105 \\u2002Official \\u2002Cert\\u2002Guide\\nOn physical interfaces and multipoint subinterfaces\\n■They need to use either Inverse ARP or static mapping.\\n■The show frame-relay map command should list the remote router’s Frame Relay IP\\naddress and the local router’s local DLCI for each PVC associated with the interface or\\nsubinterface. The “dynamic” notation means the mapping was learned with InARP.\\n■If you’re using static mapping, the broadcast keyword is needed to support a routing\\nprotocol.\\nFor completeness, Example I-23 shows the output of the show frame-relay map command \\non router R1 from Figure I-7 with no problems with the mapping. (The earlier problems that \\nwere introduced have been fixed.) In this case, interface S0/0/0.2 is a point-to-point subin -\\nterface, and S0/0/0.34 is a multipoint with one Inverse ARP-learned mapping and one stati-\\ncally configured mapping.\\nExample I-23  show frame-relay map Command on R1\\nR1# show frame-relay map\\nSerial0/0/0.34 (up): ip 10.1.34.4 dlci 104(0x68,0x1880), static,\\nbroadcast,CISCO, status defined, active\\nSerial0/0/0.34 (up): ip 10.1.34.3 dlci 103(0x67,0x1870), dynamic,\\nbroadcast,, status defined, active\\nSerial0/0/0.2 (up): point-to-point dlci, dlci 102(0x66,0x1860), broadcast\\nstatus defined, active\\nEnd-to-End Encapsulation (Step 5)\\nThe end-to-end encapsulation on a PVC refers to the headers that follow the Frame Relay \\nheader, with two options: the Cisco-proprietary header and an IETF standard header. The configuration details were covered earlier in this chapter, in the section “Configuring the \\nEncapsulation and LMI.”\\nAs it turns out, a mismatched encapsulation setting on the routers on opposite ends of the \\nlink might cause a problem in one particular case. If one router is a Cisco router using Cisco \\nencapsulation and the other router is a non-Cisco router using IETF encapsulation, pings \\nmight fail because of the encapsulation mismatch. However, two Cisco routers can under-stand both types of encapsulation, so it should not be an issue in networks with only Cisco routers.\\nMismatched Subnet Numbers (Step 6)\\nAt this point, if the problems found in the first five of the six troubleshooting steps have been resolved, all the Frame Relay problems should be resolved. However, if the two routers on either end of the PVC have mistakenly configured IP addresses in different \\nsubnets, the routers will not be able to ping one another, and the routing protocols will not \\nbecome adjacent. So, as a last step, you should confirm the IP addresses on each router and the masks and ensure that they connect to the same subnet. To do so, just use the show ip \\ninterface brief and show interfaces commands on the two routers.\\nptg17396363\\nIAppendix \\u2002I:\\u2002Implementing \\u2002Frame \\u2002Relay\\u2002 \\u2002 31\\nExam Preparation Tasks\\nReview All the Key Topics\\nReview the most important topics from this chapter, noted with the Key Topic icon.

All references to other content in this appendix refer to CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105 Official Cert Guide and not this book.\\nThe first two chapters here in Part VI of the book made us think more about the entire \\nenterprise IPv4 network. Chapter 21, “Subnet Design,” examined all the subnets in a sub-netting plan, so you could look at an enterprise network and know which subnets could \\nbe used, beyond what subnets were already in use. Chapter 22, “Variable-Length Subnet \\nMasks,” took that a step further, looking at the entire enterprise IPv4 network when using \\nvariable-length subnet masks (VLSM), thinking about what subnets do exist and which ones could exist within the rules of VLSM. \\nThis chapter and the next keep that approach toward the entire enterprise network. \\nHowever, the topic moves from subnetting design to troubleshooting. How do you trouble-shoot an IPv4 network? How do you verify correct operation, identify root causes, and fix those for various IP routing features? How do you do that in the presence of an IP address-\\ning and subnetting plan, requiring you to apply all that subnetting math from Part IV of this \\nbook and from the last few chapters? This chapter and the next start to answer some of \\nthose questions.\\nIn particular, this chapter focuses on IP troubleshooting tools, with two in particular: ping \\nand traceroute. Both tools test the IPv4 data plane; that is, the ability of each networking \\ndevice to route or forward IPv4 packets. A problem with routing is often a symptom but not a root cause, with the root cause then being other problems, like interface failures, rout-ing protocol issues, misconfiguration of various features, and the like.\\nThe chapter ends with a short discussion of two other router tools that can also be useful \\nfor troubleshooting: Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH).\\nptg17396363“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz\\nThe troubleshooting chapters of this book pull in concepts from many other chapters. In \\nfact, troubleshooting IPv4 may be one of the most important topics to learn for both the CCENT and CCNA R&S certifications. So, it is useful to read this chapter (and the next \\nchapter, also about troubleshooting IPv4 networks) regardless of your current knowledge \\nlevel. For these reasons, some troubleshooting chapters do not include a “Do I Know This Already?” quiz. \\nFoundation Topics\\nProblem Isolation Using the ping Command\\nSomeone     sends you an email or text, or a phone message, asking you to look into a user’s network problem. You Secure Shell (SSH) to a router and issue a ping command that works. \\nWhat does that result rule out as a possible reason for the problem? What does it rule in as \\nstill being a possible root cause?\\nThen you issue another ping to another address, and this time the ping fails. Again, what \\ndoes the failure of that ping command tell you? What parts of IPv4 routing may still be a \\nproblem, and what parts do you now know are not a problem?\\nThe ping command gives us one of the most common network troubleshooting tools. When \\nthe ping command succeeds, it confirms many individual parts of how IP routing works, rul-\\ning out some possible causes of the current problem. When a ping command fails, it often \\nhelps narrow down where in the internetwork the root cause of the problem may be hap-\\npening, further isolating the problem.\\nThis section begins with a brief explanation of how ping works. It then moves on to some \\nsuggestions and analysis of how to use the ping command to isolate problems by removing some items from consideration    .\\nPing Command Basics\\nThe     ping command tests connectivity by sending packets to an IP address, expecting the device at that address to send packets back. The command sends packets that mean “if you receive this packet, and it is addressed to you, send a reply back.” Each time the ping \\ncommand sends one of these packets and receives back the message sent back by the other host, the ping command knows a packet made it from the source host to the destination and back.\\nMore formally, the ping command uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), \\nspecifically the ICMP echo request and ICMP echo reply messages. ICMP defines many \\nother messages as well, but these two messages were made specifically for connectivity test-ing by commands like ping. As a protocol, ICMP does not rely on TCP or UDP, and it does not use any application layer protocol. It exists as a protocol used to assist IP by helping manage the IP network functions.\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure J-1 shows the ICMP messages, with IP headers, in an example. In this case, the user \\nat host A opens a command prompt and issues the ping 172.16.2.101 command, testing \\nconnectivity to host B. The command sends one echo request, and waits (Step 1); host B \\nreceives the messages, and sends back an echo reply     (Step 2).\\nB172.16.2.101 172.16.1.51\\nR1 R2A\\nICMP\\nEcho RequestIP 1\\nICMP\\nEcho ReplyIP 2SW1 SW2\\nFigure J-1 Concept Behind ping 172.16.2.101 on Host A\\nThe ping command is supported on many different devices and many common operating \\nsystems. The command has many options: the name or IP address of the destination, how \\nmany times the command should send an echo request, how long the command should wait (timeout) for an echo reply, how big to make the packets, and many other options. Example J-1 shows a sample from host A, with the same command that matches the concept in Figure \\nJ-1: a ping 172.16.2.101 command on host     A.\\nExample J-1 Sample Output from Host A’s ping 172.16.2.101 Command\\nWendell-Odoms-iMac:~ wendellodom$ ping 172.16.2.101\\nPING 172.16.2.101 (172.16.2.101): 56 data bytes\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.112 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.673 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.631 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.674 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.642 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.16.2.101: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.656 ms\\n^C\\n--- 172.16.2.101 ping statistics ---6 packets transmitted, 6 packets received, 0.0% packet loss    \\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.631/0.731/1.112/0.171 ms\\nStrategies and Results When Testing with the ping Command\\nOften, the person handling initial calls from users about problems (often called a customer \\nsupport rep, or CSR) cannot issue ping commands from the user’s device. In some cases, talking users through typing the right commands and making the right clicks on their \\nmachines can be a problem. Or, the user just might not be available. As an alternative, using \\ndifferent ping commands from different routers can help isolate the problem.\\nThe problem with using ping commands from routers, instead of from the host that has the \\nproblem, is that no single router ping command can exactly replicate a ping command done \\nfrom the user’s device. However, each different ping command can help isolate a problem \\nfurther. The rest of this section of ping commands discusses troubleshooting IPv4 routing by using various ping commands from the command-line interface (CLI) of a router.\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  5\\nTesting Longer Routes from Near the Source of the Problem\\nMost     problems begin with some idea like “host X cannot communicate with host Y.” A \\ngreat first troubleshooting step is to issue a ping command from X for host Y’s IP address. \\nHowever, assuming the engineer does not have access to host X, the next best test is to ping \\nhost X’s IP address from the router nearest the host that has the problem.\\nFor instance, in Figure J-1, imagine that the user of host A had called IT support with a \\nproblem related to sending packets to host B. A ping 172.16.2.101 command on host A \\nwould be a great first troubleshooting step, but the CSR cannot access host A or get in \\ntouch with the user of host A. So, the CSR telnets to Router R1, and pings host B from \\nthere, as shown in Example J-2.\\nExample J-2 Router R2 Pings Host B (Two Commands)\\nR1# ping 172.16.2.101\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.16.2.101, timeout is 2 seconds:\\n.!!!!\\nSuccess rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/4 ms\\nR1# ping 172.16.2.101\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nSending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.16.2.101, timeout is 2 seconds:\\n!!!!!\\nSuccess rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/4 ms\\nFirst, take a     moment to review the output of the first IOS ping command. By default, the \\nCisco IOS ping command sends five echo messages, with a timeout of 2 seconds. If the \\ncommand does not receive an echo reply within 2 seconds, the command considers that \\nmessage to be a failure, and the command lists a period. If a successful reply is received \\nwithin 2 seconds, the command displays an exclamation point. So, in this first command, the first echo reply timed out, whereas the other four received a matching echo reply within 2 seconds.\\nAs a quick aside, the example shows a common and normal behavior with ping  com-\\nmands: the first ping  command shows one failure to start, but then the rest of the mes-\\nsages work. This usually happens because some device in the end-to-end route is missing \\nan ARP table entry.\\nNow think about troubleshooting and what a working ping command tells us about the cur-\\nrent behavior of this internetwork. First, focus on the big picture for a moment:\\n■ R1 can send ICMP echo request messages to host B (172.16.2.101).\\n■ R1 sends these messages from its outgoing interface’s IP address (by default), 172.16.4.1\\nin this case.\\n■ Host B can send ICMP echo reply messages to R1’s 172.16.4.1 IP address (hosts send\\necho reply messages to the IP address from which the echo request was received).\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure J-2 shows the packet flow.\\n172.16.1.0/24 172.16.4.1\\nEcho Request\\nEcho Reply172.16.2.0/24\\nS0/0/0A\\n.2 SW1 SW2\\n.101B\\nR1 R2\\nFigure J-2 Standard ping 172.6.2.101 Command Using the Source Interface IP Address\\nNext,     think about IPv4 routing. In the forward direction, R1 must have a route that matches \\nhost B’s address (172.16.2.101); this route will be either a static route or one learned with a routing protocol. R2 also needs a route for host B’s address, in this case a connected route to B’s subnet (172.16.2.0/24), as shown in the top arrow lines in Figure J-3.\\n172.16.1.0/24 172.16.2.0/24Connected\\nConnectedStatic or Dynamic\\nDefault Router172.16.4.1A\\n.2 SW1 SW2\\n.51B\\n172.16.2.101R1 R2\\nFigure J-3 Layer 3 Routes Needed for R1’s Ping 172.16.2.101 to Work\\nThe     arrow lines on the bottom of Figure J-3 show the routes needed to forward the ICMP echo reply message back to Router R1’s 172.16.4.1 interface. First, host B must have a valid default router setting because 172.16.4.1 sits in a different subnet than host B. R2 must also have a route that matches destination 172.16.4.1 (in this case, likely to be a connected route).\\nThe working ping commands in Example J-2 also require the data link and physical layer \\ndetails to be working. The serial link must be working: The router interfaces must be up/up, which typically indicates that the link can pass data. On the LAN, R2’s LAN interface must be in an up/up state. In addition, everything discussed about Ethernet LANs must be work-\\ning because the ping confirmed that the packets went all the way from R1 to host B and \\nback. In particular\\n■ The switch interfaces in use are in a connected (up/up) state.\\n■ Port security does not filter frames sent by R2 or host B.\\n■ STP has placed the right ports into a forwarding state.\\nNOTE The ICND2 book discusses STP in depth, but the need to consider STP port state is \\nmentioned here for completeness for those planning to achieve CCNA R&S certification. \\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  7\\nThe ping 172.16.2.101 command in Example J-2 also confirms that IP access control lists \\n(ACL) did not filter the ICMP messages. As a reminder, an ACL on a router does not filter \\npackets created on that same router, so R1 would not have filtered its own ICMP echo \\nrequest message. The rest of the ICMP messages could have been filtered entering or exit-\\ning the router interfaces. Figure J-4 shows the locations where an IP ACL could have filtered the messages generated as a result of R1’s ping 172.16.2.101     command.\\nIn OutIn\\nInA\\nSW1 SW2\\n.51B\\n172.16.2.101R1 R2Out\\nFigure J-4 Locations Where IP ACLs Could Have Filtered the Ping Messages\\nFinally    , the working ping 172.16.2.101 command on R1 can also be used to reasonably \\npredict that ARP worked on R2 and host B and that switch SW2 learned MAC addresses for its MAC address table. R2 and host B need to know each other’s MAC addresses so that they can encapsulate the IP packet inside an Ethernet frame, which means both must have a matching ARP table entry. The switch learns the MAC address used by R2 and by host B \\nwhen it sends the ARP messages or when it sends the frames that hold the IP packets. Figure \\nJ-5 shows the type of information expected in those tables.\\nF0/2\\nMAC Address\\nF0/2\\nF0/100200.2222.22220200.0202.0202OutputSW2 Address Table0200.0202.0202 0200.2222.2222\\nF0/10MAC Address\\n172.16.2.101 0200.2222.2222IP AddressR2 ARP Table \\nMAC Address\\n172.16.2.2 0200.0202.0202IP AddressHost B ARP Table \\nR2B\\n172.16.2.101 172.16.2.2\\nFigure J-5 Router and Host ARP Tables, with the Switch MAC Address Table\\nAs you can see from the last few pages, a strategy of using a ping command from near the \\nsource of the problem can rule out a lot of possible root causes of any problems between \\ntwo hosts—assuming the ping command succeeds. However, this ping command does not \\nact exactly like the same ping command on the actual host. To overcome some of what is missing in the ping command from a nearby router, the next several examples show some \\nstrategies for testing other parts of the path between the two hosts that may have     a current \\nproblem.\\nUsing Extended Ping to Test the Reverse Route\\nPinging        from the default router, as discussed in the past few pages, misses an opportunity \\nto test IP routes more fully. In particular, it does not test the reverse route back toward the original host.\\nptg173963638  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFor instance, referring to the internetwork in Figure J-2 again, note that the reverse routes \\ndo not point to an address in host A’s subnet. When R1 processes the ping 172.16.2.101 \\ncommand, R1 has to pick a source IP address to use for the echo request, and routers \\nchoose the IP address of the outgoing interface. The echo request from R1 to host B flows \\nwith source IP address 172.16.4.1 (R1’s S0/0/0 IP address). The echo reply flows back to that same address (172.16.4.1).\\nA standard ping often does not test the reverse route that you need to test. In this case, the \\nstandard ping 172.16.2.101 command on R1 does not test whether the routers can route \\nback to subnet 172.16.1.0/24, instead testing their routes for subnet172.16.4.0. A better ping test would test the route back to host A’s subnet; an extended ping from R1 can cause that test to happen. Extended ping allows R1’s ping command to use R1’s LAN IP address \\nfrom within subnet 172.16.1.0/24. Then, the echo reply messages would flow to host A’s \\nsubnet, as shown in Figure J-6      .\\n172.16.1.0/24 172.16.2.0/24172.16.1.1\\nEcho Request\\nEcho ReplyS0/0/0\\n.2\\n.101R1 R2 SW1 SW2B AG0/0\\n.51\\nFigure J-6 Extended Ping Command Tests the Route to 172.16.1.51 (Host A)\\nThe extended ping command does allow the user to type all the parameters on a potentially long command, but it also allows users to simply issue the ping command, press Enter, \\nwith IOS then asking the user to answer questions to complete the command, as shown in Example J-3. The example shows the ping command on R1 that matches the logic in Figure J-6. This same command could have been issued from the command line as ping \\n172.16.2.101 source 172.16.1.1 .      \\nExample J-3 Testing the       Reverse Route Using the Extended Ping\\nR1# ping\\nProtocol [ip]:\\nTarget IP address: 172.16.2.101\\nRepeat count [5]:\\nDatagram size [100]:\\nTimeout in seconds [2]:\\nExtended commands [n]: y\\nSource address or interface: 172.16.1.1\\nType of service [0]:\\nSet DF bit in IP header?

For that direction, R2 needs a route that matches address 172.16.1.1, which is likely \\nto be a route for subnet 172.16.1.0/24—the same subnet in which host A resides.\\nFrom       a troubleshooting perspective, using both standard and extended ping commands can \\nbe useful. However, neither can exactly mimic a ping command created on the host itself \\nbecause the routers cannot send packets with the host’s IP address. For instance, the extend-\\ned ping in Example J-3 uses source IP address 172.16.1.1, which is not host A’s IP address. \\nAs a result, neither the standard or extended ping commands in these two examples so far in this chapter can test for some kinds of problems, such as the following:\\n■ ACLs that discard packets based on host A’s IP address, while that same ACL permitspackets matched on the router’s IP address\\n■ LAN switch port security issues that filter A’s packets (based on A’s MAC address)\\n■ IP routes on routers that happen to match host A’s 172.16.1.51 address, with differentroutes that match R1’s 172.16.1.1 address\\n■ Problems with host A’s default router       setting\\nNOTE ACLs are covered in ICND1 Chapter 25, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists,” and Chapter 26, “Advanced IPv4 Access Control Lists.” For now, know that a router can look \\nat packets as they enter or exit an interface, make comparisons to the header fields, and if \\nmatched, make a choice to either discard the packet or let it through. ACLs act as a packet \\nfilter based on criteria the network engineer configures on the router.\\nTesting LAN Neighbors with Standard Ping\\nTesting       using a ping of another device on the LAN can quickly confirm whether the LAN \\ncan pass packets and frames. Specifically, a working ping rules out many possible root \\ncauses of a problem. For instance, Figure J-7 shows the ICMP messages that occur if R1 \\nissues the command ping 172.16.1.51, pinging host A, which sits on the same VLAN as R1.\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n.1\\n172.16.1.0 /24ping 172.16.1.51\\nA\\nR1 R2\\nEcho Request\\nEcho Reply.51Destination 172.16.1.1… \\nSame Subnet!\\nFigure J-7 Standard ping Command Confirms That the LAN Works\\nIf the ping works, it confirms the following, which rules out some potential issues:\\n■ The host with address 172.16.1.51 replied.\\n■ The LAN can pass unicast frames from R1 to host 172.16.1.51 and vice versa.\\n■ You can reasonably assume that the switches learned the MAC addresses of the router\\nand the host, adding those to the MAC address tables.\\n■ Host A and Router R1 completed the ARP process and list each other in their respectiveAddress Resolution Protocol       (ARP) tables.\\nThe failure of a ping, even with two devices on the same subnet, can point to a variety of \\nproblems, like those mentioned in this list. For instance, if the ping 172.16.1.51 on R1 fails \\n(Figure J-7), that result points to this list of potential root causes:\\n■ IP addressing problem: Host A could be statically configured with the wrong IP address.\\n■ DHCP problems: If you are using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), manyproblems could exist: Host A could be using a different IP address than 172.16.1.51, theDHCP configuration could be wrong, the routers may be missing the DHCP relay con-\\nfiguration and so host A never got its IPv4 address lease, and so on.\\n■ VLAN trunking problems: The router could be configured for 802.1Q trunking, when\\nthe switch is not (or vice versa).\\n■ LAN problems: Any LAN problem discussed in Parts II and III of the ICND1 book, andPart I of the ICND2       book.\\nSo, whether the ping works or fails, simply pinging a LAN host from a router can help fur-\\nther isolate the problem.\\nTesting LAN Neighbors with Extended Ping\\nA standard ping of a LAN host from a router does not test that host’s default router setting. \\nHowever, an extended ping can test the host’s default router setting. Both tests can be use-ful, especially for problem isolation, because\\n■ If        a standard ping of a local LAN host works…\\n■ But an extended ping of the same LAN host fails…\\n■ The problem likely relates somehow to the host’s default router setting.\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  11\\nFirst, to understand why the standard and extended ping results have different effects, con-\\nsider first the standard ping 172.16.1.51 command on R1, as shown previously in Figure \\nJ-7. As a standard ping command, R1 used its LAN interface IP address (172.16.1.1) as the \\nsource of the ICMP Echo. So, when the host (A) sent back its ICMP echo reply, host A \\nconsidered the destination of 172.16.1.1 as being on the same subnet. Host A’s ICMP echo reply message, sent back to 172.16.1.1, would work even if host A did not have a default router setting at all!\\nIn comparison, Figure J-8 shows the difference when using an extended ping on Router \\nR1. An extended ping from local Router R1, using R1’s S0/0/0 IP address of 172.16.4.1 as the source of the ICMP echo request, means that host A’s ICMP echo reply will flow to an \\naddress in another subnet, which makes host A use its default router        setting.\\n172.16.1.1 172.16.4.1 .51ping 172.16.1.51\\nA\\nR1 R2172.16.1.0 /24\\n172.16.4.0 /24Destination 172.16.4.1…\\nAnother Subnet!\\nEcho Request\\nEcho Reply1\\n32\\nFigure J-8 Extended ping Command Does Test Host A’s Default Router Setting\\nThe comparison between the previous two figures shows one of the most classic mistakes \\nwhen troubleshooting networks.

So, the engineer moves on, thinking that the network layer issues between the router and host work fine, when the problem still exists with the host’s default router        setting.\\nTesting WAN Neighbors with Standard Ping\\nAs       with a standard ping test across a LAN, a standard ping test between routers over a serial WAN link tests whether the link can pass IPv4 packets. With a properly designed IPv4 addressing plan, two routers on the same serial link should have IP addresses in the same \\nsubnet. A ping from one router to the serial IP address of the other router confirms that an \\nIP packet can be sent over the link and back, as shown in the ping 172.16.4.2 command on \\nR1 in Figure J-9.\\n172.16.4.1 172.16.4.2\\nEcho Request\\nEcho Replyping 172.16.4.2\\nA\\nSW1 SW2\\n172.16.2.101 .51B\\nR1 R2\\nFigure J-9 Pinging Across a WAN Link\\nptg1739636312  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nA       successful ping of the IP address on the other end of a serial link that sits between two \\nrouters confirms several specific facts, such as the following:\\n■ Both router’s serial interfaces are in an up/up state.\\n■ The Layer 1 and 2 features of the link work.\\n■ The routers believe that the neighboring router’s IP address is in the same subnet.\\n■ Inbound ACLs on both routers do not filter the incoming packets, respectively.\\n■ The remote router is configured with the expected IP address (172.16.4.2 in this case).\\nNote that troubleshooting serial links poses a bit of a sequencing issue in these books, because Cisco places almost all WAN topics into the ICND2 part of the CCNA R&S exam \\ntopics, so the WAN details sit in the ICND2 book. In fact, this book includes some WAN \\ntopics to support the discussion of other features within ICND1, like ping and traceroute. For now, ICND1 readers who plan to move on to ICND2 and to get their CCNA R&S cer-tification can wait until you get into the WAN topics in the ICND2 book. If you just want to get into the detail now, I put a copy of the ICND2 book’s chapter “Implementing Point-\\nto-Point WANs,” on the DVD of the ICND1 book, just for you. Feel free to use that DVD \\nchapter (on the DVD as DVD-only Appendix P) if you do not happen to have a copy of the ICND2 book. \\nTesting by pinging the other neighboring router does not test many other features, though. \\nFor instance, pinging the neighboring router’s serial IP address only tests one route on each router: the connected route to the subnet on the serial link. This ping does not test any routes for subnets on LANs. Also, neither the source or destination IP address matches the two hosts that have the original problem, so this test does not do much to help find issues \\nwith ACLs. However, although the test is limited in scope, it does let you rule out W AN links \\nas having a Layer 1 or 2 problem, and it rules out some basic Layer 3 addressing       problems.\\nUsing Ping with Names and with IP Addresses\\nAll     the ping examples so far in this chapter show a ping of an IP address. However, the ping command can use hostnames, and pinging a hostname allows the network engineer to fur-ther test whether the Domain Name System (DNS) process works.\\nFirst, most every TCP/IP application today uses hostnames rather than IP addresses to \\nidentify the other device. No one opens a web browser and types in http://72.163.4.161/. Instead, they type in a web address, like www.cisco.com, which includes the hostname \\nwww.cisco.com. Then, before a host can send data to a specific IP address, the host must \\nfirst ask a DNS server to resolve that hostname into the matching IP address.\\nFor example, in the small internetwork used for several examples in this chapter, a ping B \\ncommand on host A tests A’s DNS settings, as shown in Figure J-10. When host A sees the \\nuse of a hostname (B), it first looks in its local DNS name cache to find out whether it has already resolved the name B. If not, host A first asks the DNS to supply (resolve) the name into its matching IP address (Step 1 in the figure). Only then does host A send a packet to \\n172.16.2.101, host B’s IP address     (Step 2).\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  13\\nDNS\\nA\\nR1B\\nR2R31\\n2\\nFigure J-10 DNS Name Resolution by Host A\\nWhen troubleshooting, testing from the host by pinging using a hostname can be very help-\\nful. The command, of course, tests the host’s own DNS client settings. For instance, a classic comparison is to first ping the destination host using the hostname, which requires a DNS request. Then, repeat the same test, but use the destination host’s IP address instead of its name, which does not require the DNS request. If the ping of the hostname fails but the \\nping of the IP address works, the problem usually has something to do with     DNS.\\nProblem Isolation Using the traceroute Command\\nLike ping,       the traceroute command helps network engineers isolate problems. Here is a \\ncomparison of the two:\\n■ Both send messages in the network to test connectivity.\\n■ Both rely on other devices to send back a reply.\\n■ Both have wide support on many different operating systems.\\n■ Both can use a hostname or an IP address to identify the destination.\\n■ On routers, both have a standard and extended version, allowing better testing of the\\nreverse route.\\nThe biggest differences relate to the more detailed results in the output of the traceroute \\ncommand and the extra time and effort it takes traceroute to build that output. This third \\nof three major sections examines how traceroute works, plus some suggestions of how to use this more detailed information to more quickly       isolate IP routing problems.\\ntraceroute Basics\\nImagine       some network engineer or CSR starts to troubleshoot some problem. They ping \\nfrom the user’s host, ping from a nearby router, and after a few commands, convince them-selves that the host can indeed send and receive IP packets. The problem might not be \\nsolved yet, but the problem does not appear to be a network problem.\\nNow imagine the next problem comes along, and this time the ping command fails. It \\nappears that some problem does exist in the IP network. Where is the problem? Where \\nshould the engineer look more closely? Although ping can prove helpful in isolating the \\nsource of the problem, the traceroute command may be a better option. The traceroute \\ncommand systematically helps pinpoint routing problems by showing how far a packet goes through an IP network before being discarded.\\nptg1739636314  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe traceroute command identifies the routers in the path from source host to destination \\nhost. Specifically, it lists the next-hop IP address of each router that would be in each of the \\nindividual routes. For instance, a traceroute 172.16.2.101 command on host A in Figure \\nJ-11 would identify an IP address on Router R1, another on Router R2, and then host B, as \\nshown in the figure. Example J-4 that follows lists the output of the command, taken from \\n      host A.\\nB172.16.1.1\\ntraceroute 172.16.2.101R1 R2A172.16.4.2 172.16.2.101\\nFigure J-11 IP Addresses Identified by a Successful traceroute 172.16.2.101 Command \\nExample J-4 Output from traceroute 172.16.2.101 on Host A\\nWendell-Odoms-iMac:~ wendellodom$ traceroute 172.16.2.101\\ntraceroute to 172.16.2.101, 64 hops max, 52 byte packets\\n 1  172.16.1.1 (172.16.1.1)  0.870 ms  0.520 ms  0.496 ms\\n 2  172.16.4.2 (172.16.4.2) 8.263 ms  7.518 ms  9.319 ms\\n 3  172.16.2.101 (172.16.2.101) 16.770 ms  9.819 ms  9.830 ms\\nHow the traceroute Command Works\\nThe       traceroute command gathers information by generating packets that trigger error mes-\\nsages from routers; these messages identify the routers, letting the traceroute command \\nlist the routers’ IP addresses in the output of the command. That error message is the ICMP \\n  Time-to-Live Exceeded (TTL Exceeded) message, originally meant to notify hosts when a \\npacket had been looping around a network.\\nIgnoring traceroute for a moment, and focusing on IP routing, IPv4 routers defeat rout-\\ning loops in part by discarding looping IP packets. To do so, the IPv4 header holds a field \\ncalled   Time To Live (TTL). The original host that creates the packet sets an initial TTL value. Then, each router that forwards the packet decrements the TTL value by 1. When a router decrements the TTL to 0, the router perceives the packet is looping, and the router discards the packet. The router also notifies the host that sent the discarded packet by sending an \\nICMP TTL Exceeded message.\\nNow back to traceroute. Traceroute sends messages with low TTL values to make the rout-\\ners send back a TTL Exceeded message. Specifically, a traceroute command begins by \\nsending several packets (usually three), each with the header TTL field equal to 1. When that packet arrives at the next router—host A’s default Router R1 in the example of Figure J-12—the router decrements TTL to 0 and discards the packet. The router then sends host A the TTL Exceeded message, which identifies the router’s IP address to the traceroute       com-\\nmand.\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  15\\n172.16.1.1\\nR1A\\nIP TTL=1\\nTTL – 1 = 01\\n2\\nTTL Exceeded\\nSource 172.16.1.13\\nFigure J-12 How traceroute Identifies the First Router in the Route\\nThe       traceroute command sends several TTL=1 packets, checking them to see whether the \\nTTL Exceeded messages flow from the same router, based on the source IP address of the \\nTTL Exceeded message. Assuming the messages come from the same router, the traceroute \\ncommand lists that IP address as the next line of output on the command. \\nTo find all the routers in the path, and finally confirm that packets flow all the way to the \\ndestination host, the traceroute command sends a packet with TTL=1, TTL=2, then 3, 4, \\nand so on, until the destination host replies. Figure J-13 shows the packet from the second set with a TTL=2. In this case, one router (R1) actually forwards the packet, while another \\nrouter (R2) happens to decrement the TTL to 0, causing a TTL Exceeded message being sent \\nback to host       A.\\nB172.16.1.1\\nR1 R2A 172.16.4.2172.16.2.101\\nIP TTL=2\\nTTL – 1 = 01\\nIP TTL=1 23\\nTTL Exceeded\\nSource 172.16.4.24S0/0/1\\nFigure J-13 TTL=2 Message Sent by traceroute\\nThe figure shows these four steps:\\n1. The traceroute command sends a packet from the second set with TTL=2.\\n2. Router R1 processes the packet and decrements TTL to 1. R1 forwards the packet.\\n3. Router R2 processes the packet and decrements TTL to 0. R2 discards the packet.\\n4. R2 notifies the sending host of the discarded packet by sending a TTL Exceeded\\nICMP message. The source IP address of that message is 172.16.4.2.\\nFinally, the choice of source IP address to use on the time-exceeded message returned by \\nrouters has a big impact on the output of the traceroute command. Most routers use sim-\\npler logic that also makes command output like traceroute more consistent and meaningful. \\nThat logic: choose the TTL Exceeded message’s source IP address based on the source inter-\\nface of the original message that was discarded due to TTL. In the example in Figure J-13, the original message at Step 2 arrived on R2’s S0/0/1 interface, so at Step 3, R2 uses S0/0/1’s IP address as the source IP address of the TTL exceeded message, and as the interface out which to send the       message.\\nptg1739636316  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nStandard and Extended traceroute\\nThe       standard and extended options for the traceroute command give you many of the \\nsame options as the ping command. For instance, Example J-5 lists the output of a standard \\ntraceroute command on Router R1. Like the standard ping command, a standard traceroute \\ncommand chooses an IP address based on the outgoing interface for the packet sent by the command. So, in this example, the packets sent by R1 come from source IP address 172.16.4.1, R1’s S0/0/0 IP address.\\nExample J-5 Standard       traceroute Command on R1\\nR1# traceroute 172.16.2.101\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nTracing the route to 172.16.2.101\\nVRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id)\\n  1 172.16.4.2 0 msec 0 msec 0 msec\\n  2 172.16.2.101 0 msec 0 msec *\\nThe extended       traceroute command, as shown in Example J-6, follows the same basic com-\\nmand structure as the extended ping command. The user can type all the parameters on one \\ncommand line, but it is much easier to just type traceroute, press Enter, and let IOS prompt \\nfor all the parameters, including the source IP address of the packets (172.16.1.1 in this example).\\nExample J-6 Extended       traceroute Command on R1\\nR1# traceroute\\nProtocol [ip]:\\nTarget IP address: 172.16.2.101\\nSource address: 172.16.1.1\\nNumeric display [n]:\\nTimeout in seconds [3]:\\nProbe count [3]:\\nMinimum Time to Live [1]:\\nMaximum Time to Live [30]:\\nPort Number [33434]:Loose, Strict, Record, Timestamp, Verbose[none]:\\nType escape sequence to abort.\\nTracing the route to 172.16.2.101\\nVRF info: (vrf in name/id, vrf out name/id)\\n  1 172.16.4.2 0 msec 0 msec 0 msec\\n  2 172.16.2.101 0 msec 0 msec *\\nBoth the ping and traceroute commands exist on most operating systems, including \\nCisco IOS. However, some operating systems use a slightly different syntax for traceroute. \\nFor example, most Windows operating systems support tracert and pathping, and not \\ntraceroute. Linux and OS X support the traceroute command      .\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  17\\nNOTE Host OS traceroute commands usually create ICMP echo requests. The Cisco IOS \\ntraceroute command instead creates IP packets with a UDP header. This bit of informa-\\ntion may seem trivial at this point. However, note that an ACL may actually filter the traffic \\nfrom a host’s traceroute messages but not the router traceroute command, or vice versa.\\nUsing traceroute to Isolate the Problem to Two Routers\\nOne       of the best features of the traceroute command, as compared to ping, is that when it \\ndoes not complete it gives an immediate clue as to where to look next. With ping, when the \\nping fails, the next step is usually to use more ping commands. With traceroute, it tells you \\nwhat router to try to connect and look at the routes and in which direction.\\nNOTE As a reminder, this book uses the term forward route for routes that send the pack-\\nets sent by the ping or traceroute command, and reverse route for the packets sent back.\\nWhen a problem exists, a traceroute command results in a partial list of routers. Then the command either finishes with an incomplete list or it runs until the user must stop the com-mand. In either case, the output does not list all routers in the end-to-end route, because of \\nthe underlying problem.\\nNOTE In addition, the traceroute command may not finish even though the network has \\nno problems. Routers and firewalls may filter the messages sent by the traceroute com-\\nmand, or the TTL Exceeded messages, which would prevent the display of portions or all or \\npart of the path.\\nThe last router listed in the output of a traceroute command’s output tells us where to look \\nnext to isolate the problem, as follows:\\n■ Connect to the CLI of the last router listed, to look at forward route issues.\\n■ Connect to the CLI of the next router that should have been listed, to look for reverse\\nroute issues      .\\nTo see why, consider an example based on the internetwork in Figure J-14. In this case, R1 uses an extended traceroute to host 5.5.5.5, with source IP address 1.1.1.1. This command’s output lists router 2.2.2.2, then 3.3.3.3, and then the command cannot complete.\\nR4 R3 R2 R1Confirms my Route to 5.5.5.5\\n4.4.4.45.5.5.5\\n3.3.3.3 2.2.2.2 1.1.1.1\\nConfirms my Route to 1.1.1.1\\nTTL ExceededTTL = 1\\nFigure J-14 Messages That Cause the traceroute Command to List 2.2.2.2\\nptg1739636318  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFirst,       Figure J-14 focuses on the first line of output: the line that lists first-hop router \\n2.2.2.2.\\nThe figure shows the TTL=1 message at the top and the TTL Exceeded message back on the \\nbottom. This first pair of messages in the figure must have worked, because without them, the traceroute command on R1 cannot have learned about a router with address 2.2.2.2. \\nThe first (top) message required R1 to have a route for 5.5.5.5, which sent the packets to \\nR2 next. The TTL Exceeded message required that R2 have a route that matched address \\n1.1.1.1, to send the packets back to R1’s LAN IP address.\\nNext, Figure J-15 foc uses on the messages that allow the second line of output on R1’s sample \\ntraceroute command: the line that correctly lists 3.3.3.3 as the next router in the route.\\nR4 R3 R2 R14.4.4.45.5.5.5\\n3.3.3.3 2.2.2.2 1.1.1.1\\nConfirms my Route to 1.1.1.1\\nTTL ExceededConfirms my Route to 5.5.5.5TTL = 2\\nFigure J-15 Messages That Cause the traceroute Command to List 3.3.3.3\\nFollowing       the same logic, the traceroute output lists 3.3.3.3 because the messages in \\nFigure J-15 must have worked. For these messages to flow, the routes listed in Figure J-14 must exist, plus new routes listed in Figure J-15. Specifically, the TTL=2 packet at the top requires R2 to have a route for 5.5.5.5, which sends the packets to R3 next. The TTL Exceeded message requires that R3 have a route that matches address 1.1.1.1, to send the \\npackets back toward R1’s LAN IP address.\\nIn this example, the traceroute 5.5.5.5 command does not list any routers beyond 2.2.2.2 \\nand 3.3.3.3 However, based on the figures, it is clear that 4.4.4.4 should be the next IP \\naddress listed. To help isolate the problem further, why might the next messages—the mes-\\nsage with TTL=3 and the response—fail?\\nFigure J-16 points out the routing issues that can cause this command to not be able to list \\n4.4.4.4 as the next router. First, R3 must have a forward route matching destination 5.5.5.5 \\nand forwarding the packet to Router R4. The return message requires a reverse route match-ing destination 1.1.1.1 and forwarding the packet back to Router       R3.\\nR4 R3 R2 R14.4.4.45.5.5.5\\n3.3.3.3 2.2.2.2 1.1.1.1\\nUse Working Route to 1.1.1.1\\nTTL ExceededUse Working Route to 5.5.5.5TTL = 3\\nProblem with Route to 5.5.5.5? \\nProblem with Route to 1.1.1.1?\\nFigure J-16 Issues That Could Prevent traceroute from Listing 4.4.4.4\\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  19\\nIn conclusion, for this example, if a routing problem prevents the traceroute command \\nfrom working, the problem exists in one of two places: the forward route to 5.5.5.5 on \\nRouter R3, or the reverse route to 1.1.1.1 on       R4.\\nTelnet and SSH\\nThe        ping and traceroute commands do give networkers two great tools to begin isolating \\nthe cause of an IP routing problem. However, these two commands tell us nothing about the operation state inside the various network devices. Once you begin to get an idea of the \\nkinds of problems and the possible locations of the problems using ping and traceroute, the \\nnext step is to look at the status of various router and switch features. One way to do that is \\nto use Telnet or Secure Shell (SSH) to log in to the devices.\\nCommon Reasons to Use the IOS Telnet and SSH Client\\nNormally,        a network engineer would log in to the remote device using a Telnet or SSH cli-ent on their PC, tablet, or any other user device. In fact, often times, the same software package does both Telnet and SSH. However, in some cases, you may want to take advan-\\ntage of the Telnet and SSH client built in to IOS on the routers and switches, to Telnet/SSH \\nfrom one Cisco device to the next.\\nTo understand why, consider the example shown in Figure J-17. The figure shows arrowed \\nlines to three separate IP addresses on three separate Cisco routers. PC1 has attempted to \\nTelnet to each address from a different tab in PC1’s Telnet/SSH client. However, R2 hap-pens to have an error in its routing protocol configuration, so R1, R2, and R3 fail to learn any routes from each other. As a result, PC1’s Telnet attempt to both 10.1.2.2 (R2) and 10.1.3.2 (R3) fails.\\nR1 R3 R2.1 .1\\nG0/2\\n10.1.1.0/24 10.1.2.0/24 10.1.3.0/24G0/1 G0/1.2\\nG0/2.3\\nG0/2.2\\nG0/1PC1\\nFigure J-17 Telnet Works from PC1 to R1 but Not to R2 or R3\\nIn        some cases, like this one, a Telnet or SSH login from the network engineer’s device can \\nfail, while you could still find a way to log in using the telnet and ssh commands to use \\nthe Telnet and SSH clients on the routers or switches. With this particular scenario, all the individual data links work; the problem is with the routing protocol exchanging routes. PC1 can ping R1’s 10.1.1.1 IP address, R1 can ping R2’s 10.1.2.2 address, and R2 can ping R3’s \\n10.1.3.3 address. Because each link works, and each router can send and receive packets \\nwith its neighbor on the shared data link, you could Telnet/SSH to each successive device.\\nFigure J-18 shows the idea. On the left, PC1 begins with either a Telnet/SSH or a console \\nconnection into Router R1, as shown on the left. Then the user issues the telnet 10.1.2.2 \\ncommand from R1 to Telnet to R2. Once logged into R2, the user can issue commands on \\nR2. Then from R2, the user could issue the telnet 10.1.3.3 command to Telnet to R3, from \\nwhich the user could issue commands on        R3.\\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nR1 R3 R2Subnet 10.1.2.0/24 Subnet 10.1.3.0/24R1> telnet 10.1.2.2 R2> telnet 10.1.3.3\\n.1 .2 .3 .2 PC1 .1\\nFigure J-18 Successive Telnet Connections: PC1 to R1, R1 to R2, and R2 to R3\\nThe        Telnet connections shown in Figure J-18 work because each Telnet in this case uses \\nsource and destination addresses in the same subnet. For example, R1’s telnet 10.1.2.2 command uses 10.1.2.2 as the destination of course. R1 uses the outgoing interface IP address used to send packets to 10.1.2.2, 10.1.2.1 in this case. Because each of these telnet \\ncommands connects to an IP address in a connected subnet, the routing protocol could \\nbe completely misconfigured, and you could still Telnet/SSH to each successive device to \\ntroubleshoot and fix the problem.\\nNetwork engineers also use the IOS Telnet and SSH client just for preference. For instance, \\nif you need to log in to several Cisco devices, you could open several windows and tabs on \\nyour PC, and log in from your PC (assuming the network was not having problems). Or, you could log in from your PC to some nearby Cisco router or switch, and from there Telnet or SSH to other Cisco devices       .\\nIOS Telnet and SSH Examples\\nUsing        the IOS Telnet client via the telnet host command is pretty simple. Just use the IP \\naddress or hostname to identify the host to which you want to connect, and press Enter. \\nExample J-7 shows an example based on Figure J-18, with R1 using Telnet to connect to \\n10.1.2.2 (R2).\\nExample J-7 Telnet from R1 to R2 to View Interface Status on R2\\nR1# telnet 10.1.2.2 \\nTrying 10.1.2.2 ...

After \\nptg17396363JAppendix J: IPv4 Troubleshooting Tools  21\\nissuing the telnet 10.1.2.2 command, R2 asks the user for both a username and password, \\nbecause Router R2 uses local username authentication, which requires those credentials.

The -l  flag means that the next parameter is \\nthe login username. In this case, the user begins logged in to Router R1, and then uses the \\nssh -l wendell 10.1.2.2  command to SSH to Router R2. R2 expects a username/password \\nof wendell/odom, with wendell supplied in the command, and odom supplied when R2 \\nprompts the user.\\nExample J-8 SSH Client from R1 to R2 to View Interface Status on R2\\nR1# ssh -l wendell 10.1.2.2\\nPassword:R2> \\nR2> show ip interface brief \\nInterface IP-Address OK?

We then make new editions of the books to match the new exams. (Once we even made a new edition of the book without a \\nnew version of the exam, just because it was a long time between new versions of the exam.) \\nAs a result, the current CCNA Routing and Switching exam (200-125) is the seventh version of that exam, and the two-book CCNA R&S Cert Guides are basically the eighth editions of the content in these books. \\nAs with every new edition, the book content is based on Cisco’s exam topics; that is, the \\nbook attempts to cover the topics Cisco lists as exam topics. However, Cisco not only adds topics but also removes topics for each new edition. In some cases, I feel the need to keep some of the content covering exam topics that Cisco chose to remove. There are a few rea-\\nsons why. Sometimes I just feel the need to keep that content around for that one reader in \\none thousand who might care. Also, more than a few schools use these books as textbooks. So, I decided to copy some of the old material as DVD appendixes. \\nIn some cases, an old topic that exists as a complete chapter is an extra appendix available \\nas softcopy only. For other, smaller topics, I have collected them into this DVD appendix. These topics were in some past editions, or even in drafts that did not get published in one or two cases. Regardless, the material is here in case you find it useful. But certainly do not feel like you have to read this appendix for the current exam.\\nThe topics in this appendix are as follows:\\n■Dial access with modems and ISDN\\n■GLBP concepts and configuration\\n■HSRP tracking\\n■OSPFv2 link-state advertisements\\n■OSPFv3 link-state advertisements\\nNOTE The content under the heading “Dial Access with Modems and ISDN” was most \\nrecently published for the 200-101 Exam in 2013, in Chapter 15 of the Cisco CCNA \\nRouting and Switching ICND2 200-101 Official Cert Guide.\\nDial Access with Modems and ISDN\\nThe two Internet access technologies discussed in this section require us to think back to \\nthe early days of the Internet for some perspective. The Internet had many booming growth periods over time, but one such period took off in the very early 1990s, when commercial traffic was beginning to drive huge growth in the Internet.\\nptg17396363Back in those early days of the Internet, for consumers, most people accessed the Internet \\nusing dial-up. That is, they used their analog phone line and an analog modem and basically placed a phone call to an ISP.\\nAs a brief bit of background, when using a home telephone line, a phone call creates an \\nelectrical circuit that uses analog signals. Computers use digital signals; so to use an analog circuit, something had to convert from digital to analog. The solution: an analog modem.\\nAnalog modems would sit at each end of the call—one at the customer site, and one at the \\nISP. To send the digital data from the customer’s PC or router, the modem would modulate, or convert, the digital signal to an analog signal. The sending modem would then transmit \\nthe analog signals to the receiving modem, which would then demodulate the analog back \\ninto the original digits. (The term \\nmodem  comes from the squashing of those two terms \\ntogether: modulate and demodulate.)\\nFigure K-1 shows the general idea, with two examples. One shows a PC with an external \\nmodem, meaning that the PC connects to the modem with a cable. The other shows an internal modem. The ISP would then have a matching set of modems, called a modem bank. A phone call to the ISP’s phone number would ring to any available modem, allowing a cus-\\ntomer to connect to any one of the ISP modems and be connected to the Internet.\\n...\\nModem BankLocal\\nLoopISP Dial-In: 555-1234External Modem\\nInternal ModemLocal\\nLoop Telco\\nPoPR1A\\nB\\nFigure K-1 Internet Access Using External and Internal Modems\\nToday, most ISPs refer to this option as dial access  or simply dial. And even though ISPs \\nhave used it for decades, most ISPs still offer dial services. Dial can be inexpensive in some \\nmarkets and a workable service for people in remote areas where faster Internet access \\noptions are not available.\\nNOTE Telcos refer to the telephone cable that runs into a customer’s home or business \\nthe local loop.\\nDial access happens to have several cost advantages compared to other consumer Internet access options. The ISP purposefully puts a point of presence (PoP) in most local calling areas, so the phone call to connect to the Internet is free, rather than having a long-distance charge. Also the equipment cost fell pretty quickly over time, so the price to get started is \\nrelatively low. And in many markets, almost every home has a home phone line already, so \\nthere is no need to spend more for the physical access link. As a result, the only added cost \\nis the fee to the ISP to allow access into the Internet.\\nOf course, there are negatives, too. You can either surf the Internet or make a voice phone \\ncall, but not both. To use the Internet, you had to make a phone call first, so the Internet was not “on” all the time. But the speed is the biggest issue, with a fast modem having a bit rate over the line of only 56 Kbps, an incredibly slow speed by today’s standards.\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nOver time, the telcos of the world set out to improve over the analog modem option. \\nOne early improvement used an entirely new technology called Integrated Services Digital \\nNetwork (ISDN). ISDN allowed some of the same cost advantages as analog modems, but \\nwith faster speeds. For instance:\\n■ISDN used the same local loop (local phone line), which most people already had.\\n■ISDN required the equivalent of a phone call to the ISP, just like with analog modems.\\n■ISPs already had a PoP in each local calling areas to support analog modems, so these\\nISDN calls would not require any long-distance charges.\\nThe big advantage of ISDN was speed. ISDN uses digital signals over the local loop, instead \\nof analog. In addition, it supports two calls at the same time, each at 64 Kbps, over that one local loop phone line. Both calls (channels) could be dialed to the ISP, for a 128-Kbps \\nInternet service. Or, the user could make one voice phone call and have one 64-Kbps \\nInternet connection at the same time. ISDN did cost a little more—you had to pay the telco \\nfor the upgraded ISDN service—but you got concurrent Internet and voice, plus better speed than analog modems.\\nFigure K-2 shows some particulars of ISDN. The consumer side of an ISDN used a line \\ncalled a Basic Rate Interface (BRI), which has the two 64-Kbps channels for user traffic. Physically, the connection used some type of ISDN-aware device, often referred to as an ISDN modem, taking the place of an analog modem.\\nISP Dial-In: 555-1234\\nISDN BRI Modem\\n2 x 64 Kbps CallsISDN PRI (T1)\\n23 x 64 Kbps CallsLocal Loop\\nTelco\\nPoPR1A\\nFigure K-2 Typical ISDN Connection\\nThe ISP side of the connection could use many different technologies, as well, including an \\nISDN technology called a Primary Rate Interface (PRI). This technology turned a T1 physi-cal line into 23 ISDN channels ready to accept those ISDN calls, as shown on the right.\\nBoth analog modems and ISDN filled big needs for Internet access in the early days of \\nthe Internet. Using existing phone lines that people already paid for anyway was a great business model. However, their relatively slow speeds led to innovation to faster Internet \\naccess—both from the telcos of the world and their emerging competitors of the time, the \\ncable TV companies.

The content was in two sepa-\\nrate sections, one on GLBP concepts, one on GLBP configuration.\\nGateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)\\nThis section first discusses GLBP concepts, followed by GLBP configuration.\\nGLBP Concepts\\nHot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which were introduced before Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP), balanced the packet load per subnet. However, because traffic loads vary unpredictably from subnet to \\nsubnet, Cisco wanted a First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP) option with better load-\\nbalancing options than just the per-subnet load balancing of HSRP and VRRP. To meet that need, Cisco introduced GLBP.\\nGLBP balances the packet load per host by using an active/active model in each subnet. \\nEach GLBP router in a subnet receives off-subnet packets from some of the hosts in the subnet. Each host still remains unaware of the FHRP, allowing the hosts to configure the same default gateway/router setting and for the hosts to make no changes when a router fails.\\nGLBP creates a world that at first glance looks like HSRP, but with a few twists that let \\nGLBP balance the traffic. Like HSRP, all the routers configure a virtual IP address, which is the IP address used by hosts as their default router. Like with HSRP, hosts use a default \\nrouter setting that points to the virtual IP address, and that setting does not need to change. \\nGLBP differs from HSRP with regard to the MAC addresses it uses and the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) process, because GLBP actually uses ARP Reply messages to bal-ance traffic from different hosts through different routers.\\nWith GLBP, one router acts in a special role called the \\nactive virtual gateway  (AVG). The \\nAVG replies to all ARP requests for the virtual IP address. Each router has a unique virtual \\nMAC address, so that the AVG can reply to some ARP Requests with one virtual MAC, and \\nsome with the other. As a result, some hosts in the subnet send frames to the Ethernet MAC \\naddress of one of the routers, with other hosts sending their frames to the MAC address of the second router.\\nAs an example, Figure K-3 shows the process by which a GLBP balances traffic for host A \\nbased on the ARP Reply sent by the AVG (R1). The two routers support virtual IP address 10.1.1.1, with the hosts using that address as their default router setting.\\nptg173963636  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRouter\\nR1\\nR1R2GLBP Table 10.1.1.0/24\\nR1.1\\nVMAC1\\nR2VMAC2\\n.1To VMAC1ARP: 10.1.1.1?Address\\n10.1.1.1VMAC1VMAC21\\nARP: VMAC1A2\\n3\\nDataAVGRole\\nAVG\\nForwarderForwarder\\nFigure K-3 GLBP Directs Host A by Sending Back ARP Reply with R1’s VMAC1\\nThe figure shows three messages, top to bottom, with the following action:\\n1. Host A has no ARP table entry for its default router, 10.1.1.1, so host A sends an ARP\\nRequest to learn 10.1.1.1’s MAC address.\\n2. The GLBP AVG, R1 in this case, sends back an ARP Reply. The AVG chooses to\\ninclude its own virtual MAC address in the ARP Reply, VMAC1.\\n3. Future IP packets sent by host A are encapsulated in Ethernet frames, destined to\\nVMAC1, so that they arrive at R1.\\nFrom now on, host A sends off-subnet packets to R1 due to host A’s ARP table entry for \\nits default gateway (10.1.1.1). Host A’s ARP table entry for 10.1.1.1 now refers to a MAC \\naddress on R1 (VMAC1), so packets host A sends off-subnet flow through R1.\\nTo balance the load, the AVG answers each new ARP Request with the MAC addresses of \\nalternating routers. Figure K-4 continues the load-balancing effect with the ARP Request for \\n10.1.1.1 coming from host B. The router acting as AVG (R1) still sends the ARP Reply, but \\nthis time with R2’s virtual MAC (VMAC2).\\nR1.1\\nVMAC1\\nR2VMAC2\\n.1To VMAC2ARP: 10.1.1.1?1\\nARP: VMAC2B2\\n3\\nDataRouter\\nR1\\nR1R2GLBP Table\\nAddress\\n10.1.1.1VMAC1VMAC2Role\\nAVG\\nForwarderForwarderAVG\\nFigure K-4 GLBP Directs Host B by Sending Back ARP Reply with R2’s VMAC2\\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  7\\nHere are the steps in the figure:\\n1. Host B sends an ARP Request to learn 10.1.1.1’s MAC address.\\n2. The GLBP AVG (R1) sends back an ARP Reply, listing VMAC2, R2’s virtual MAC\\naddress.\\n3. For future packets sent off-subnet, host B encapsulates the packets in Ethernetframes, destined to VMAC2, so that they arrive at R2.\\nThe process shown in Figures K-3 and K-4 balances the traffic, per host, but the routers \\nmust also be ready to take over for the other router if it fails. GLBP refers to each router as a forwarder. When all is well, each router acts as forwarder for its own virtual MAC address, but it listens to GLBP messages to make sure the other forwarders are still working. If another forwarder fails, the still-working forwarder takes over the failed forwarder’s vir-\\ntual MAC address role and continues to forward traffic.\\nConfiguring and Verifying GLBP\\nGLBP configuration mimics HSRP configuration to a great degree. \\nExample K-1 shows a GLBP configuration with both routers using GLBP group 1, with vir-\\ntual IP address 10.1.1.1, with the glbp 1 ip 10.1.1.1 interface subcommand.\\nExample K-1 GLBP Configuration on R1 and R2, Sharing IP Address 10.1.1.1\\n!

As with HSRP, if \\nboth come up at the same time, R1 will win, with a priority set to 110 with the glbp 1 pri-\\nority 110 command versus R2’s default priority of 100. However, if either router comes up \\nbefore the other, that router goes ahead and takes on the AVG role.\\nSifting through the GLBP show  command output takes a little more work than with HSRP, \\nin particular because of the added detail in how GLBP works. First, consider the show glbp \\nbrief  command on Router R1, as shown in Example K-2. (Note that many show glbp  com-\\nmands have the same options as equivalent HSRP show standby  commands.)\\nptg173963638  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample K-2 GLBP Status on R1 with show glbp brief\\nR1# show glbp brief\\nInterface   Grp  Fwd Pri State    Address Active router   Standby router\\nGi0/0       1    -   110 Active   10.1.1.1 local 10.1.1.129\\nGi0/0 1    1   -   Listen   0007.b400.0101  10.1.1.129 -\\nGi0/0 1    2   -   Active   0007.b400.0102  local  \\nBefore looking at the right side of the output, first consider the context for a moment. This \\nexample lists a heading line and three rows of data. These data rows are identified by the Grp and Fwd headings, short for Group and Forwarder. With only one GLBP group config-\\nured, R1 lists lines only for group 1. More important, each row defines details about a dif-\\nferent part of what GLBP does, as follows:\\nFwd is -: This line refers to none of the forwarders, and instead describes the AVG.\\nFwd is 1: This line describes GLBP forwarder (router) 1.Fwd is 2: This line describes GLBP forwarder (router) 2.\\nThe output usually lists the line about the AVG first, as noted with a dash in the Forwarder \\ncolumn. Now look at the highlighted portions on the right of Example K-2. This line will list the virtual IP address and identify the active AVG and the standby AVG. This particular command, from Router R1, lists R1 itself (“local”) as the active router. So, R1 is the current AVG.\\nEach of the next two lines lists status information about one of the forwarder roles; that is, \\na router that uses a virtual MAC address, receives frames sent to that address, and routes the packets encapsulated in those frames. To that end, the Address column lists MAC \\naddresses, specifically the virtual MAC addresses used by GLBP, and not the interface \\nMAC addresses.\\nEach forwarder row also identifies the router that currently uses the listed virtual MAC \\nin the Active Router column. In Example K-2, 0007.b400.0101 is used by the router with \\ninterface IP address 10.1.1.129 (which happens to be R2). 0007.b400.0102 is supported by the local router (the router on which the \\nshow  command was issued), which is R1.\\nThe brief output of the show glbp brief  command lists many details, but it takes some \\neffort to learn how to sift through it all. For more perspective on the output, Example K-3 lists this same \\nshow glbp brief  command, this time on R2. Note that the Fwd column again \\nidentifies the first line of output as being about the AVG, with the next two lines about the two forwarders.\\nExample K-3 GLBP Status on R2 with show glbp brief\\nR2# show glbp brief\\nInterface   Grp  Fwd Pri State    Address Active router   Standby router\\nGi0/0 1    -   100 Standby  10.1.1.1 10.1.1.9 local\\nGi0/0 1    1   -   Active   0007.b400.0101  local -\\nGi0/0 1    2   -   Listen   0007.b400.0102  10.1.1.9 -\\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  9\\nThe State column in the output in Examples K-2 and K-3 can pull the GLBP concepts \\ntogether. First, to define the meaning of the state values, the following short list defines the states expected for the first line of output, about the AVG, and then about each GLBP \\nforwarder:\\nAVG: One router should be the active AVG, with the other acting as standby, ready to \\ntake over the AVG role if the AVG fails.\\nEach forwarder: One router should be active, while the other should be listening, ready \\nto take over that virtual MAC address if that forwarder fails.\\nTable K-2 collects the values of the State column from Examples K-2 and K-3 for easier \\nreference side by side. Note that, indeed, each line has either an active/standby pair (for the \\nAVG) or an active/listen pair (for the forwarder function).\\nTable K-2 Comparing Local State in show glbp brief Commands\\nRow Is About… Fwd Column Value R1 State R2 State\\nA VG - Active Standby\\nForwarder 1 1 Listen Active\\nForwarder 2 2 Active Listen\\nFinally, the show glbp command lists a more detailed view of the current GLBP status. \\nExample K-4 shows a sample from Router R1. Note that the first half of the output has similar information compared to HSRP’s \\nshow standby  command, plus it lists the IP and \\nMAC addresses of the routers in the GLBP group. Then, the end of the output lists a group of messages per GLBP forwarder.\\nExample K-4 GLBP Status on R1 with show glbp\\nR1# show glbp\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 - Group 1\\n  State is Active\\n    2 state changes, last state change 00:20:59\\n  Virtual IP address is 10.1.1.1\\n  Hello time 3 sec, hold time 10 sec    Next hello sent in 2.112 secs\\n  Redirect time 600 sec, forwarder timeout 14400 sec\\n  Preemption disabled\\n  Active is local\\n  Standby is 10.1.1.129, priority 100 (expires in 8.256 sec)\\n  Priority 110 (configured)\\n  Weighting 100 (default 100), thresholds: lower 1, upper 100\\n  Load balancing: round-robin\\n  IP redundancy name is \"GLBP-group-for-book\"\\n  Group members:\\n    0200.0101.0101 (10.1.1.9) local    0200.0202.0202 (10.1.1.129)\\n  There are 2 forwarders (1 active)\\n  Forwarder 1\\nptg1739636310  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n    State is Listen\\n2 state changes, last state change 00:20:34\\n    MAC address is 0007.b400.0101 (learnt)\\n    Owner ID is 0200.0202.0202\\n    Redirection enabled, 598.272 sec remaining (maximum 600 sec)\\n    Time to live: 14398.272 sec (maximum 14400 sec)\\n    Preemption enabled, min delay 30 sec\\n    Active is 10.1.1.129 (primary), weighting 100 (expires in 8.352 sec)\\n    Client selection count: 1\\n  Forwarder 2\\n    State is Active\\n1 state change, last state change 00:24:25\\n    MAC address is 0007.b400.0102 (default)\\n    Owner ID is 0200.0101.0101\\n    Redirection enabled\\n    Preemption enabled, min delay 30 sec\\n    Active is local, weighting 100\\n    Client selection count: 1\\nNOTE The content under the heading “HSRP Tracking” was most recently published for \\nthe 200-101 Exam in 2013, in Appendix B of the Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching \\nICND2 200-101 Official Cert Guide. \\nHSRP Tracking\\nChapter 20 shows how to configure the HSRP priority so that one router will be preferred as the active router in an HSRP group. For example, Example 20-1 in Chapter 20 shows two routers in the same HSRP group, with R1 using a slightly better (numerically higher) priority \\nof 110 and R2 using default priority 100, so that R1 becomes the active router when both \\nrouters are up and working. Figure K-5 shows a similar design, with Router R1 as active (pri-ority 110) and R2 as standby (priority 100), using HSRP virtual IP address 10.1.1.1.\\nA\\nB\\nGW=\\n10.1.1.1\\nC\\nDActiveVLAN 1\\nSubnet 10.1.1.0/24\\nSW1\\nSW2R1\\nR2SW3\\nSW410.1.1.1 HSRP\\nStandbyR3\\nR4S0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nFigure K-5 Design That Benefits from HSRP Tracking\\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  11\\nThe network design benefits from another HSRP feature: interface tracking. IOS can track \\nthe state of an interface, with a variable for the interface as being either up or down. Then, you can change the HSRP priority value based on tracking variables, changing HSRP’s \\nchoice of which router is primary based on other events and status inside the router.\\nFor example, notice the big X over the upper WAN link in Figure K-5. What happens when \\nR1’s WAN link is down? Clearly, the WAN path through R2 and R4 should probably be \\nused. However, all the hosts on the left still use R1 as their default gateway, when using R2 \\nwould clearly be more efficient. Instead, the HSRP configuration could be changed as fol-lows:\\n■Set the priority values as noted earlier, so that under normal operation, R1 is active:\\nR1 = 110, R2 = 100.\\n■R1 tracks its S0/0/0 interface, such that when S0/0/0 fails, R1 lowers its HSRP priority\\nby 20.\\n■R2 tracks its S0/0/1 interface, such that when S0/0/1 fails, R2 lowers its HSRP priority\\nby 20.\\n■When the standby router priority becomes better (higher) than the currently active rout-\\ner, take over the role of HSRP active (a feature called preemption).\\nExample K-5 completes the picture of HSRP interface tracking. Example K-5 shows R1’s basic HSRP configuration, with tracking of the WAN interface as described here, and enables preemption. (Similar configuration would need to be added to R2 as well.) As a \\nresult, when all links work, R1 remains the active HSRP router, with priority 110. If R1’s \\nWAN link then fails, R1’s priority falls to 90 and R2’s remains at 100, so R2 preempts R1’s \\nactive role so that R2 takes over as the active HSRP router.\\nExample K-5 HSRP Configuration on R1 \\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0\\n ip address 10.1.1.9\\n standby version 2\\n standby ip 10.1.1.1\\n standby 1 priority 110\\n standby 1 track serial0/0/0 20\\n standby 1 preempt\\nFHRPs all provide some level of tracking. For example, HSRP can track interfaces and use \\nmore complex object tracking that considers multiple factors to reach a decision.\\nNOTE The content under the heading “(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements” was most \\nrecently published for the 200-101 Exam in 2013, in Chapter 8 of the Cisco CCNA \\nRouting and Switching ICND2 200-101 Official Cert Guide, under the heading “Link-\\nState Advertisements.”\\nptg1739636312  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\n(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements\\nMany people tend to get a little intimidated by OSPF LSAs when first learning about them. \\nThe output of the show ip ospf database  command—a command that lists a summary of \\nthe output—is pretty long. Commands that look at specific LSAs list a lot more informa-tion. The details appear to be in some kind of code, using lots of numbers. It can seem like a \\nbit of a mess.\\nHowever, if you examine LSAs while thinking about OSPF areas, and area design, some of \\nthe most common LSA types will make a lot more sense. For instance, think about the LSDB \\nin one area. The topology details includes routers and the links between the routers. As it \\nturns out, OSPF defines the first two types of LSAs to define those exact details, as follows:\\n■One router LSA for each router in the area\\n■One network LSA for each network that has a DR plus one neighbor of the DR\\nNext, think about the subnets in the other areas. The ABR creates summary information about each subnet in other areas—basically just the subnet IDs and masks—as a third type \\nof LSA:\\n■One summary LSA for each subnet ID that exists in a different area\\nThe next few pages discuss these three LSA types in a little more detail; Table K-3 lists some \\ninformation about all three for easier reference and study.\\nTable K-3 The Three OSPFv2 LSA Types Seen with a Multiarea OSPF Design\\nName Number Primary Purpose Contents of LSA\\nRouter LSA 1 Describe a router RID, interfaces, IP address/mask, \\ncurrent interface state (status)\\nNetwork 2 Describe a network that has a \\nDRDR and BDR IP addresses, subnet \\nID, mask\\nSummary 3 Describe a subnet in another \\nareaSubnet ID, mask, RID of ABR \\nthat advertises the LSA\\nNOTE In some networks, both OSPF and other routing protocols are used. In that case, \\none or more routers run both OSPF and the other routing protocol, with those routers \\nacting as an OSPF Autonomous System Border Router, or ASBR, redistributing routing \\ninformation between OSPF and the other protocol. In such a case, the ASBR creates a Type \\n4 LSA, which describes the ASBR itself, and Type 5 LSAs for each external route learned from the other routing protocol and then advertised into OSPF.\\nRouter LSAs Build Most of the Intra-Area Topology\\nOSPF needs very detailed topology information inside each area. The routers inside area X \\nneed to know all the details about the topology inside area X. And the mechanism to give routers all these details is for the routers to create and flood router (Type 1) and network (Type 2) LSAs about the routers and links in the area.\\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  13\\nRouter LSAs, also known as Type 1 LSAs, describe the router in detail. Each lists a router’s \\nRID, its interfaces, its IPv4 addresses and masks, its interface state, and notes about what \\nneighbors the router knows out its interfaces.\\nTo see a specific instance, first review Figure K-6. It lists internetwork topology, with sub-\\nnets listed. As a small internetwork, the engineer chose a single-area design, with all inter-\\nfaces in backbone area 0.\\n10.1.14.0/24R3 R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/010.1.1.0/2410.1.12.0/2410.1.23.0/24\\n10.1.4.0/2410.1.2.0/24G0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/110.1.13.0/24Area 0\\nFigure K-6 Enterprise Network with Seven IPv4 Subnets\\nWith the single-area design planned for this small internetwork, the LSDB will contain four \\nrouter LSAs. Each router creates a router LSA for itself, with its own RID as the LSA identi-fier. The LSA lists that router’s own interfaces, IP address/mask, with pointers to neighbors.\\nOnce all four routers have copies of all four router LSAs, SPF can mathematically analyze \\nthe LSAs to create a model. The model looks a lot like the concept drawing in Figure K-7. Note that the drawing shows each router with an obvious RID value. Each router has point-\\ners that represent each of its interfaces, and because the LSAs identify neighbors, SPF can \\nfigure out which interfaces connect to which other routers.\\nR1\\nType\\n11.1.1.1\\nR3\\nType\\n1\\nR4\\nType\\n13.3.3.32.2.2.2\\n4.4.4.4R2\\nType\\n1\\nFigure K-7 Type 1 LSAs, Assuming a Single-Area Design\\nptg1739636314  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNetwork LSAs Complete the Intra-Area Topology\\nWhereas router LSAs define most of the intra-area topology, network LSAs define the rest. \\nAs it turns out, when OSPF elects a DR on some subnet and that DR has at least one neigh-\\nbor, OSPF treats that subnet as another node in its mathematical model of the network. To represent that network, the DR creates and floods a network (Type 2) LSA for that network \\n(subnet).\\nFor instance, back in Figure K-6, one Ethernet LAN and one Ethernet WAN exist. The \\nEthernet LAN between R2 and R3 will elect a DR, and the two routers will become neigh-\\nbors; so, whichever router is the DR will create a network LSA. Similarly, R1 and R4 con-\\nnect with an Ethernet WAN, so the DR on that link will create a network LSA.\\nFigure K-8 shows the completed version of the intra-area LSAs in area 0 with this design. \\nNote that the router LSAs actually point to the network LSAs when they exist, which lets \\nthe SPF processes connect the pieces together.\\nType\\n2R1\\nType\\n11.1.1.1\\nR3\\nType\\n1\\nR4\\nType\\n13.3.3.32.2.2.2\\nR2\\nType\\n1\\nType\\n2\\n4.4.4.4\\nFigure K-8 Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs in Area 0, Assuming a Single-Area Design\\nNOTE The drawings in the last two figures work a little like a jigsaw puzzle. The SPF algo-\\nrithm basically solves the jigsaw puzzle, but by looking at all the numbers inside the differ-ent LSAs, to see which LSAs fit next to which other LSAs.\\nFinally, note that in this single-area design example no summary (Type 3) LSAs exist at all. These LSAs represent subnets in other areas, and there are no other areas. The next example shows some summary LSAs.\\nLSAs in a Multiarea Design\\nMigrating from a single-area design to a multiarea design has a couple of effects on LSAs:\\n■Each area has a smaller number of router and network LSAs.\\n■The ABRs have a copy of the LSDB for each area to which they connect.\\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  15\\n■The ABRs each have a router LSA in each area’s LSDB.\\n■Each area has a need for some summary (Type 3) LSAs to describe subnets in other areas.\\nBefore focusing on these summary LSAs, first work through a new example for a moment. \\nFigure K-9 begins this new example using the same internetwork topology as Figure K-6, \\nbut now with a multiarea design, with Router R1 as the only ABR.\\nArea 4R3R1\\nR4R2\\nG0/0.11S0/0/1\\nS0/0/0\\nS0/0/1\\nG0/1\\nG0/0S0/0/0Area 0Area 23\\nG0/0.12G0/0\\nG0/0\\nG0/110.1.23.0/24\\n10.1.4.0/2410.1.1.0/24\\n10.1.2.0/24\\n10.1.14.0/2410.1.12.0/24\\n10.1.13.0/24\\nFigure K-9 Multiarea Design for the Same Internetwork as Figure K-6\\nNext, consider what router and network LSAs should be in the area 4 LSDB.

(For this appendix, the con-\\ntent has been edited for clarity in the context of this book.)\\nMismatched OSPF Network Types\\nOSPF defines a concept for each interface called a network type. The OSPF network type  \\ntells OSPF some ideas about the data link to which the interface connects. In particular, the \\nnetwork type tells a router:\\n■Whether the router can dynamically discover neighbors on the attached link (or not)\\n■Whether to elect a DR and BDR (or not)\\nThis book happens to cover configuration details that require only two OSPF network \\ntypes. The OSPF network type called point-to-point is used by default in obvious point-to-point topologies. Those include serial interfaces that use some point-to-point data link pro-tocol, like HDLC or PPP, as well as the point-to-point GRE tunnels included in Chapter 15, “Private WANs with Internet VPN.” The other OSPF network type, the \\nbroadcast  network \\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  17\\ntype, is used on broadcast media, in which all devices can communicate directly with all \\nother devices. Ethernet interfaces default to use an OSPF network type of broadcast. \\nThe OSPF network type changes OSPF’s behavior on an interface, in particular, in regard to \\nwhether the router dynamically discovers other routers using Hello messages, and whether \\nthe routers on the link attempt to elect a DR and BDR or not. Of the two OSPF network \\ntypes used by default in this book, both types allow the routers to dynamically discover the neighboring OSPF routers. However, only the broadcast network type causes the router to use a DR/BDR; the point-to-point network type does not, because a DR/BDR would serve no useful purpose in a point-to-point topology. \\nThe \\nshow ip ospf interface  command lists an interface’s current OSPF network type. \\nExample K-6 shows Router R1, from the earlier examples, with a network type of “broad-\\ncast” on its G0/0 interface.\\nExample K-6 Displaying the OSPF Network Type on an Interface\\nR1# show ip ospf interface g0/0\\nGigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up\\n  Internet Address 10.1.1.1/24, Area 0, Attached via Network Statement\\n  Process ID 1, Router ID 1.1.1.1, Network Type BROADCAST, Cost: 1\\n! Lines omitted for brevity\\nIt is possible to change the OSPF network type on an interface and, by making poor choices \\nabout the settings on neighboring routers, to prevent the routers from becoming OSPF neighbors. Normally, engineers either leave this setting at its default value or change the \\nsetting for all routers on the same link. However, by choosing poorly, and using different \\nnetwork types on different neighboring routers, problems can occur.\\nFor instance, if Routers R1 and R2 from the sample internetwork used in this appendix \\nstill connect to the same VLAN, both using their G0/0 interfaces, they both by default use \\nOSPF network type broadcast. These routers work best on their Ethernet interfaces with an OSPF network type of broadcast. As a result, both dynamically learn about each other as an OSPF router, and they both try to use a DR/BDR. However, if R1 was changed to use network type point-to-point on its G0/0 interface instead, problems occur. The result? The \\nrouters actually still become neighbors, because both network type broadcast and network \\ntype point-to-point allow for the dynamic discovery of OSPF neighbors. However, the two routers fail to exchange their LSDBs, as shown by R1, because one router is attempting to use the process that relies on a DR, while the other router is not. Example K-7 shows an example matching this paragraph’s description.\\nExample K-7 Mismatched OSPF Network Types Causing a Failure to Exchange LSDBs\\nR1# configure terminal\\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.

Lines omitted for brevity\\nNote that to the depth discussed in this book, using the default OSPF network types makes \\nperfect sense. However, more complex topologies can drive the need to use different OSPF network types, even with different settings on some routers in the same subnet. The CCNP \\nand CCIE R&S exams include more details about how to use the OSPF network type. Note \\nthat the ICND2 200-105 Cert Guide’s Appendix I, “Implementing Frame Relay,” discusses one use of OSPF network types with Frame Relay.\\nNOTE The content under the heading “(OSPFv3) Link-State Advertisements” was most \\nrecently published for the 200-101 Exam in 2013, in Chapter 17 of the Cisco CCNA \\nRouting and Switching ICND2 200-101 Official Cert Guide.\\n(OSPFv3) Link-State Advertisements\\nThe next section examines OSPF LSAs as defined by OSPFv3 for use in advertising IPv6 \\nroutes.\\nOSPFv3 LSDB and LSAs\\nOnce OSPFv3 routers become neighbors, they proceed to exchange their LSDBs over that subnet. In most cases, the two routers exchange their LSDBs directly, and when finished, each router lists its neighbor as having reached a full state. Once in a full state, the two rout-\\ners should have the same link-state advertisements (LSA) for that area.\\nThis section takes a brief look at the LSDB and the LSAs in an area, which once again look \\nsimilar to the LSDB and LSAs used for OSPFv2. Then this section looks at one rare configu-\\nration issue that allows two routers to become OSPFv3 neighbors for a short time, while \\ncausing the topology exchange process to fail.\\nVerifying OSPFv3 LSAs\\nOSPFv3 uses similar concepts, with slightly different naming for the equivalent of OSPFv2’s \\nType 1, 2, and 3 LSAs. As explained back in the previous section, “(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements,” OSPFv2 uses the Type 1 router LSA and Type 2 network LSA to define \\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  19\\nthe topology inside an area. The Type 3 summary LSA then describes for one area a subnet \\nthat exists in some other area—an interarea subnet, if you will.\\nFor the configuration options shown for OSPFv2 in this book, only these three types of \\nLSAs are needed in the OSPFv2 LSDB.\\nOSPFv3 keeps those same three LSA concepts, renaming the summary LSA. The following \\nlist summarizes these three key OSPFv3 LSA types and the reasons why OSPFv3 routers create each:\\n■One router LSA (Type 1 LSA) for each router in the area (including ABRs attached to the\\narea)\\n■One network LSA (Type 2 LSA) for each network that has a DR plus one neighbor of the\\nDR\\n■One interarea prefix (Type 3 LSA) LSA for each IPv6 prefix (subnet) that exists in a dif-\\nferent area\\nFor example, in area 4 in the sample network used in this appendix, two routers exist: inter-nal router R4 and ABR R1. So, the area 4 LSDB will have a router LSA for each router. One network exists in this area for which a DR will be used (the Ethernet WAN between R1 and \\nR4). R1 and R4 will become neighbors, as well, so one network LSA will be created for that \\nnetwork. Finally, ABR R1 will know about five different IPv6 prefixes that exist outside \\narea 4, so ABR R1 should create and flood five interarea prefix LSAs into area 4. Figure K-12 shows the conceptual model of these LSAs for area 4.\\nType\\n21.1.1.1\\n4.4.4.4\\nR4\\nType\\n1R1\\nType\\n1\\nType 3\\n2001:DB8:1:23::/64Type 3\\n2001:DB8:1:13::/64Type 3\\n2001:DB8:1:12::/64Type 3\\n2001:DB8:1:2::/64Type 3\\n2001:DB8:1:1::/64\\nFigure K-12 Type 1, 2, and 3 LSAs That Should Exist in Area 4\\nBeyond this basic LSA structure, OSPFv3 does make several changes to LSAs compared to OSPFv2. The details inside these LSAs change, and OSPFv3 adds several new LSA types not seen in OSPFv2. However, these details are beyond the scope of this book.\\nTo see the LSAs of Figure K-12 in an actual router, Example K-8 lists the beginning of the \\narea 4 LSDB as it exists in Router R4. The example highlights the headings and the IPv6 pre-\\nfixes of the interarea prefix LSAs. Note that the output indeed shows two router LSAs, one line for the single network LSA and five lines with the interarea prefixes.\\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nExample K-8 LSDB Content in Area 4, as Viewed from R4\\nR4# show ipv6 ospf database\\nOSPFv3 Router with ID (4.4.4.4) (Process ID 4)\\nRouter Link States (Area 4)\\nADV Router Age Seq# Fragment ID  Link count  Bits\\n 1.1.1.1 258 0x80000072  0 1 B\\n 4.4.4.4 257 0x80000003  0 1 None\\nNet Link States (Area 4)\\nADV Router Age Seq# Link ID    Rtr count\\n 4.4.4.4 257 0x80000001  4 2\\nInter Area Prefix Link States (Area 4)\\nADV Router Age Seq#       Prefix\\n 1.1.1.1 878 0x80000069  2001:DB8:1:1::/64\\n 1.1.1.1 878 0x80000068  2001:DB8:1:2::/64\\n 1.1.1.1 364 0x8000000A  2001:DB8:1:13::/64\\n 1.1.1.1 364 0x8000000A  2001:DB8:1:23::/64\\n 1.1.1.1 364 0x8000000A  2001:DB8:1:12::/64\\n!

In the earlier chapters of this book, all the OSPF examples you have seen for IPv4 are OSPFv2 examples. This section shows examples \\nof OSPFv3, for IPv6 routes only, and specifically OSPFv3 without using the address fami-\\nlies feature.\\nEIGRP (discussed in Chapter 24) has gone through a similar transformation as OSPF through \\nits history of IPv6 support. Cisco calls the traditional EIGRP style either EIGRP \\nclassic  \\nmode or EIGRP autonomous system  mode. EIGRP supports a newer mode called EIGRP \\nnamed mode; this mode, like OSPFv3’s address family mode, uses address families in the \\nconfiguration. Chapter 24 discusses EIGRP for IPv6 classic mode.\\nTo close the list, Routing Information Protocol (RIP) also supports IPv6, but its history does \\nnot track quite as closely. RIP has two versions that support IPv4, with the expected names \\nptg17396363KAppendix K: Topics from Previous Editions  21\\nof RIP version 1 (RIPv1) and RIP version 2 (RIPv2). To support IPv6, a working group cre-\\nated a new version of RIP, called RIP Next Generation (RIPng), with the name chosen in \\nreference to the Star Trek TV series. (Yep.) (Cisco often refers to this protocol today as RIP \\nfor IPv6.) To date, RIPng support in IOS has not gone through a similar transformation to \\ninclude address families.\\nTable K-4 summarizes the names of the protocols for easier review and study.

The switch would never forward a frame sent by Dino (in VLAN 1) over to either Wilma or Betty (in VLAN 2).\\nFredDino\\nBettyWilmaBroadcast\\nDomain 2(VLAN 2)Broadcast\\nDomain 1\\n(VLAN 1)\\nSW1\\nSubnet 2 Subnet 1\\nFigure 1-2 Creating Two Broadcast Domains Using One Switch and VLANs\\nptg173963632  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nDesigning campus LANs to use more VLANs, each with a smaller number of devices, often \\nhelps improve the LAN in many ways. For example, a broadcast sent by one host in a \\nVLAN will be received and processed by all the other hosts in the VLAN—but not by hosts \\nin a different VLAN. Limiting the number of hosts that receive a single broadcast frame \\nreduces the number of hosts that waste effort processing unneeded broadcasts. It also reduces security risks, because fewer hosts see frames sent by any one host. These are just a few reasons for separating hosts into different VLANs. The following list summarizes the \\nmost common reasons for choosing to create smaller broadcast domains (VLANs):\\n■To reduce CPU overhead on each device by reducing the number of devices that receive\\neach broadcast frame\\n■To reduce security risks by reducing the number of hosts that receive copies of frames\\nthat the switches flood (broadcasts, multicasts, and unknown unicasts)\\n■To improve security for hosts that send sensitive data by keeping those hosts on a sepa-\\nrate VLAN\\n■To create more flexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that work\\ntogether, instead of by physical location\\n■To solve problems more quickly, because the failure domain for many problems is the\\nsame set of devices as those in the same broadcast domain\\n■To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to a\\nsingle access switch\\nptg17396363Key Topics  3\\nThe use of trunking allows switches to pass frames from multiple VLANs over a single \\nphysical connection by adding a small header to the Ethernet frame. For example, Figure \\n1-5 shows PC11 sending a broadcast frame on interface Fa0/1 at Step 1. To flood the frame, \\nswitch SW1 needs to forward the broadcast frame to switch SW2. However, SW1 needs to \\nlet SW2 know that the frame is part of VLAN 10, so that after the frame is received, SW2 will flood the frame only into VLAN 10, and not into VLAN 20. So, as shown at Step 2, before sending the frame, SW1 adds a VLAN header to the original Ethernet frame, with \\nthe VLAN header listing a VLAN ID of 10 in this case.\\n20 10 20 10 20VLAN 10\\nVLAN 2013\\n0/1 0/2\\nG0/2 G0/1\\n0/3 0/414\\n23 24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 2011\\n0/1\\n0/3 0/4\\n21 223 3Ethernet1 Ethernet\\n2VLAN 10 EthernetSW1 SW2\\nFigure 1-5 VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches\\nptg173963634  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhile both ISL and 802.1Q tag each frame with the VLAN ID, the details differ. 802.1Q \\ninserts an extra 4-byte 802.1Q VLAN header into the original frame’s Ethernet header, \\nas shown at the top of Figure 1-6. As for the fields in the 802.1Q header, only the 12-bit \\nVLAN ID field inside the 802.1Q header matters for topics discussed in this book.

The administrative mode refers to the con-\\nfiguration setting for whether trunking should be used. Each interface also has an opera-\\ntional mode, which refers to what is currently happening on the interface, and might have \\nbeen chosen by DTP’s negotiation with the other device.

In addition, Cisco best practices for IP telephony design tell us to \\nput the phones in one VLAN, and the PCs in a different VLAN. To make that happen, the \\nswitch port acts a little like an access link (for the PC’s traffic), and a little like a trunk (for \\nthe phone’s traffic). The configuration defines two VLANs on that port, as follows:\\nData VLAN: Same idea and configuration as the access VLAN on an access port, but \\ndefined as the VLAN on that link for forwarding the traffic for the device connected to \\nthe phone on the desk (typically the user’s PC).\\nVoice VLAN: The VLAN defined on the link for forwarding the phone’s traffic.

The following steps summarize the steady-state operation \\nwhen nothing is currently changing in the STP topology:\\nStep 1. The root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a root cost of 0, out all its \\nworking interfaces (those in a forwarding state).\\nStep 2. The nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports. After changing the \\nHello to list their own BID as the sender’s BID, and listing that switch’s root \\ncost, the switch forwards the Hello out all designated ports.\\nStep 3.

Note that all \\nswitches use the timers as dictated by the root switch, which the root lists in its periodic \\nHello BPDU messages. Table 2-7 describes the timers.\\nTable 2-7 STP Timers\\nTimer Default Value Description\\nHello 2 seconds The time period between Hellos created by the root.\\nMaxAge 10 times Hello How long any switch should wait, after ceasing to hear Hellos, \\nbefore trying to change the STP topology.\\nForward \\ndelay15 seconds Delay that affects the process that occurs when an interface \\nchanges from blocking state to forwarding state.

These temporary states help prevent \\ntemporary loops:\\n■Listening: Like the blocking state, the interface does not forward frames. The switch\\nremoves old stale (unused) MAC table entries for which no frames are received from\\neach MAC address during this period. These stale MAC table entries could be the cause\\nof the temporary loops.\\n■Learning: Interfaces in this state still do not forward frames, but the switch begins to\\nlearn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface.\\nptg1739636320  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 2-8 summarizes spanning tree’s various interface states for easier review.\\nTable 2-8 IEEE 802.1D Spanning-Tree States\\nState Forwards Data \\nFrames?Learns MACs Based on \\nReceived Frames?Transitory or Stable State?\\nBlocking No No Stable\\nListening No No Transitory\\nLearning No Y es Transitory\\nForwarding Y es Y es Stable\\nDisabled No No Stable\\nptg17396363Key Topics  21\\nRSTP (802.1w) works just like STP (the original 802.1D) in several ways:\\n■It elects the root switch using the same parameters and tiebreakers.\\n■It elects the root port on nonroot switches with the same rules.\\n■It elects designated ports on each LAN segment with the same rules.\\n■It places each port in either forwarding or blocking state, although RSTP calls the block-\\ning state the discarding state.\\nptg1739636322  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe best way to get a sense for these mechanisms is to see how the RSTP alternate port and \\nthe backup port both work. RSTP uses the term alternate port to refer to a switch’s other \\nports that could be used as root port if the root port ever fails. The backup port concept \\nprovides a backup port on the local switch for a designated port, but only applies to some topologies that frankly do not happen often with a modern network design. However, both are instructive about how RSTP works. Table 2-9 lists these RSTP port roles.\\nTable 2-9 Port Roles in 802.1w RSTP\\nFunction Port Role\\nNonroot switch’s best path to the root Root port\\nReplaces the root port when the root port fails Alternate port\\nSwitch port designated to forward onto a collision domain Designated port\\nReplaces a designated port when a designated port fails Backup port\\nPort that is administratively disabled Disabled port\\nptg17396363Key Topics  23\\nRSTP uses the discarding state for what 802.1D defines as two states: disabled state and \\nblocking state. Blocking should be somewhat obvious by now: The interface can work \\nphysically, but STP/RSTP chooses to not forward traffic to avoid loops. STP’s disabled state \\nsimply meant that the interface was administratively disabled. RSTP just combines those \\ninto a single discarding state. Table 2-10 shows the list of STP and RSTP states for compari-son purposes.\\nTable 2-10 Port States Compared: 802.1D STP and 802.1w RSTP\\nFunction 802.1D State 802.1w State\\nPort is administratively disabled Disabled Discarding\\nStable state that ignores incoming data frames and is not \\nused to forward data framesBlocking Discarding\\nInterim state without MAC learning and without \\nforwardingListening Not used\\nInterim state with MAC learning and without forwarding Learning Learning\\nStable state that allows MAC learning and forwarding of \\ndata framesForwarding Forwarding\\nptg1739636324  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 3\\nFor instance, Figure 3-1 shows a typical LAN design model, with two distribution layer \\nswitches (D1 and D2). The design may have dozens of access layer switches that connect to end users; the figure shows just three access switches (A1, A2, and A3). For a variety of rea-\\nsons, most network engineers make the distribution layer switches be the root.

The switch looks at the current root in that VLAN, \\nand at the root’s priority. Then the local switch chooses a priority value that causes the local switch to take over as root.\\nRemembering that Cisco switches use a default base priority of 32,768, this command \\nchooses the base priority as follows:\\n■If the current root has a base priority higher than 24,576, the local switch uses a base pri-\\nority of 24,576.\\n■If the current root’s base priority is 24,576 or lower, the local switch sets its base priority\\nto the highest multiple of 4096 that still results in the local switch becoming root.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  29\\nTo configure an EtherChannel manually, follow these steps:\\nStep 1.

Cisco Catalyst switches often show the alternate and backup ports \\nin output even when using STP and not RSTP. The alternate and backup port concepts are \\nRSTP concepts. The switches only converge faster using these concepts when using RSTP. \\nBut show command output, when using STP and not RSTP, happens to identify what would \\nbe the alternate and backup ports if RSTP were used.\\nWhy might you care about such trivia? Seeing output that lists an RSTP alternate port does \\nnot confirm that the switch is using RSTP. So, do not make that assumption on the exam. To confirm that a switch uses RSTP, you must look at the configuration of the spanning-tree \\nmode command, or look for the protocol as summarized back in Table 3-4.\\nptg1739636332  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 4\\nFor the exam, a question that asks about the root switch might not be so simple as listing \\na bunch of BIDs and asking you which one is “best.” A more likely question is a simulator (sim) question in which you have to do any show commands you like or a multiple choice \\nquestion that lists the output from only one or two commands. Then you have to apply the \\nSTP algorithm to figure out the rest.\\nWhen faced with an exam question using a simulator, or just the output in an exhibit, use a \\nsimple strategy of ruling out switches, as follows:\\nStep 1. Begin with a list or diagram of switches, and consider all as possible root \\nswitches.\\nStep 2. Rule out any switches that have an RP (show spanning-tree, show spanning-\\ntree root), because root switches do not have an RP.\\nStep 3. Always try show spanning-tree, because it identifies the local switch as root \\ndirectly: “This switch is the root” on the fifth line of output.\\nStep 4. Always try show spanning-tree root, because it identifies the local switch as \\nroot indirectly: The RP column is empty if the local switch is the root.\\nStep 5. When using a sim, rather than try switches randomly, chase the RPs. For exam-\\nple, if starting with SW1, and SW1’s G0/1 is an RP, next try the switch on the \\nother end of SW1’s G0/1 port.\\nStep 6. When using a sim, use show spanning-tree vlan x on a few switches and record \\nthe root switch, RP, and designated port (DP). This strategy can quickly show you most STP facts.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  33\\nExam questions that make you think about the RP can be easy if you know where to look \\nand the output of a few key commands is available. However, the more conceptual the \\nquestion, the more you have to calculate the root cost over each path, correlate that to dif-\\nferent show commands, and put the ideas together. The following list makes a few sugges-\\ntions about how to approach STP problems on the exam:\\n1. If available, look at the show spanning-tree and show spanning-tree root commands.\\nBoth commands list the root port and the root cost (see Example 4-1).\\n2. The show spanning-tree command lists cost in two places: the root cost at the top,\\nin the section about the root switch; and the interface cost, at the bottom, in the per-\\ninterface section. Be careful, though; the cost at the bottom is the interface cost, not\\nthe root cost!\\n3. For problems where you have to calculate a switch’s root cost:\\na. Memorize the default cost values: 100 for 10 Mbps, 19 for 100 Mbps, 4 for 1Gbps, and 2 for 10 Gbps.\\nb.  Look for any evidence of the spanning-tree cost configuration command on an\\ninterface, because it overrides the default cost. Do not assume default costs areused.\\nc. When you know a default cost is used, if you can, check the current actual speedas well. Cisco switches choose STP cost defaults based on the current speed, not\\nthe maximum speed.\\nptg1739636334  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nEach LAN segment has a single switch that acts as the designated port (DP) on that segment. \\nOn segments that connect a switch to a device that does not even use STP—for example, \\nsegments connecting a switch to a PC or a router—the switch always wins, because it is the \\nonly device sending a hello onto the link. However, links with two switches require a little \\nmore work to discover which should be the DP. By definition:\\nStep 1. For switches connected to the same LAN segment, the switch with the low-\\nest cost to reach the root, as advertised in the hello they send onto the link, \\nbecomes the DP on that link.\\nStep 2. In case of a tie, among the switches that tied on cost, the switch with the low-\\nest BID becomes the DP.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  35\\nThe following list gives some tips to keep in mind when digging into a given DP issue. Some \\nof this list repeats the suggestions for finding the RP, but to be complete, this list includes \\neach idea as well.\\n1. If available, look at the show spanning-tree commands, at the list of interfaces at the\\nend of the output. Then, look for the Role column, and look for Desg, to identify any\\nDPs.\\n2. Identify the root cost of a switch directly by using the show spanning-tree command.But be careful! This command lists the cost in two places, and only the mention at thetop, in the section about the root, lists the root cost.\\n3. For problems where you have to calculate a switch’s root cost, do the following:\\na. Memorize the default cost values: 100 for 10 Mbps, 19 for 100 Mbps, 4 for 1Gbps, and 2 for 10 Gbps.\\nb.  Look for any evidence of the spanning-tree cost configuration command on an\\ninterface, because it overrides the default cost. Do not assume default costs are\\nused.\\nc. When you know a default cost is used, if you can, check the current actual speed\\nas well. Cisco switches choose STP cost defaults based on the current speed, not\\nthe maximum speed.\\nptg1739636336  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhen STP converges based on some change, not all the ports have to change their state. For \\ninstance, a port that was forwarding, if it still needs to forward, just keeps on forwarding. \\nPorts that were blocking that still need to block keep on blocking. But when a port needs to \\nchange state, something has to happen, based on the following rules:\\n■For interfaces that stay in the same STP state, nothing needs to change.\\n■For interfaces that need to move from a forwarding state to a blocking state, the switch\\nimmediately changes the state to blocking.\\n■For interfaces that need to move from a blocking state to a forwarding state, the switch\\nfirst moves the interface to listening state, then learning state, each for the time specified\\nby the forward delay timer (default 15 seconds). Only then is the interface placed into\\nforwarding state.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  37\\nIn Chapter 3, the section titled “Configuring EtherChannel” listed the small set of working \\nconfiguration options on the channel-group command. Those rules can be summarized as \\nfollows, for a single EtherChannel:\\n1. On the local switch, all the channel-group commands for all the physical interfaces\\nmust use the same channel-group number.\\n2. The channel-group number can be different on the neighboring switches.\\n3. If using the on keyword, you must use it on the corresponding interfaces of both\\nswitches.\\n4. If you use the desirable keyword on one switch, the switch uses PAgP; the other\\nswitch must use either desirable or auto.\\n5.

If the port is an access port, associate the frame with the configured access \\nVLAN (switchport access vlan vlan_id). \\nStep 2. If the port is a voice port, or has both an IP Phone and PC (or other data device) connected to the phone:\\nA. Associate the frames from the data device with the configured \\naccess VLAN (as configured with the switchport access vlan vlan_id \\ncommand).\\nB. Associate the frames from the phone with the VLAN ID in the \\n802.1Q header (as configured with the switchport voice vlan vlan_id \\ncommand).\\nStep 3. If the port is a trunk, determine the frame’s tagged VLAN, or if there is no tag, use that incoming interface’s native VLAN ID (switchport trunk native \\nvlan_id).\\nptg1739636340  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nA switch’s data plane forwarding processes depend in part on VLANs and VLAN trunk-\\ning. Before a switch can forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must know about \\na VLAN and the VLAN must be active. And before a switch can forward a frame over a \\nVLAN trunk, the trunk must currently allow that VLAN to pass over the trunk. \\nThis final major section in this chapter focuses on VLAN and VLAN trunking issues, specifi-\\ncally issues that impact the frame switching process. The issues are as follows:\\nStep 1. Identify all access interfaces and their assigned access VLANs and reassign into \\nthe correct VLANs if incorrect.\\nStep 2. Determine whether the VLANs both exist (either configured or learned with the VLAN Trunking Protocol [VTP]) and are active on each switch.

To cause this particular problem, SW1 also disables DTP nego-\\ntiation using the switchport nonegotiate command. SW2’s configuration also helps create the problem, by using a trunking option that relies on DTP.

Identify sets of two neighboring switches that should be either VTP clients or \\nservers whose VLAN databases differ with the show vlan command.\\nStep 3. On each pair of two neighboring switches whose databases differ, verify the \\nfollowing:\\nA. Because VTP messages only flow over trunks, at least one operational \\ntrunk should exist between the two switches (use the show interfaces \\ntrunk, show interfaces switchport, or show cdp neighbors command).\\nB. The switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP domain name \\n(show vtp status).\\nC. If configured, the switches must have the same (case-sensitive) VTP \\npassword (show vtp password).\\nD. The MD5 digest should be the same, as evidence that both the domain \\nname and any configured passwords are the same on both switches \\n(show vtp status).\\nE. While VTP pruning should be enabled or disabled on all servers in the \\nsame domain, having two servers configured with opposite pruning set-\\ntings does not prevent the synchronization process.\\nStep 4.

That way a switch that\\nuses default settings (server mode, with no password set) will not accidentally overwrite\\nthe production VLAN database if connected to the production network with a trunk.\\n■In a lab, if using VTP, always use a different domain name and password than you use in\\nproduction.\\n■Disable trunking with the switchport mode access and switchport nonegotiate com-\\nmands on all interfaces except known trunks, preventing VTP attacks by preventing thedynamic establishment of trunks.\\nptg1739636350  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 6\\nFigure 6-3 rounds out this topic by showing an example of one key protocol used by \\n802.1x: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).

It includes wireless access points, which in turn connect to end-user devices. \\nFigure 6-8 shows a representation.\\nSW1\\nDHCP\\nServerTrusted Untrusted\\nSW1 R1\\nFigure 6-8 DHCP Snooping Basics: Client Ports Are Untrusted\\nptg17396363Key Topics  53\\nSo, the first rule of DHCP snooping is for the switch to trust any ports on which legitimate \\nmessages from trusted DHCP servers might arrive. Conversely, by leaving a port untrusted, \\nthe switch is choosing to discard any incoming DHCP server-only messages. Figure 6-11 \\nsummarizes these points, with the legitimate DHCP server on the left, on a port marked as \\ntrusted.\\nF0/1\\nDHCP All Messages: Approved!

The following list summarizes some of the key points about DHCP snooping for \\neasier exam study:\\nTrusted ports: Trusted ports allow all incoming DHCP messages.\\nUntrusted ports, server messages: Untrusted ports discard all incoming messages that are \\nconsidered server messages.\\nUntrusted ports, client messages: Untrusted ports apply more complex logic for mes-\\nsages considered client messages. They check whether each incoming DHCP message \\nconflicts with existing DHCP binding table information and, if so, discard the DHCP mes-\\nsage. If the message has no conflicts, the switch allows the message through, which typi-cally results in the addition of new DHCP Binding Table entries.\\nRate limiting: Optionally limits the number of received DHCP messages per second, per \\nport.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  55\\nThe scenario described so far is literally a stack of switches one above the other. Switch \\nstacking technology allows the network engineer to make that stack of physical switches act \\nlike one switch. For instance, if a switch stack was made from the four switches in Figure \\n6-13, the following would apply:\\n■The stack would have a single management IP address.\\n■The engineer would connect with Telnet or SSH to one switch (with that one manage-\\nment IP address), not multiple switches.\\n■One configuration file would include all interfaces in all four physical switches.\\n■STP, CDP, VTP would run on one switch, not multiple switches.\\n■The switch ports would appear as if all are on the same switch.\\n■There would be one MAC address table, and it would reference all ports on all physical\\nswitches.\\nptg1739636356  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe stacking cables together make a ring between the switches as shown in Figure 6-14. \\nThat is, the switches connect in series, with the last switch connecting again to the first. \\nUsing full duplex on each link, the stacking modules and cables create two paths to forward \\ndata between the physical switches in the stack. The switches use these connections to com-\\nmunicate between the switches to forward frames and to perform other overhead functions.\\nStacking CablesA1 A2 A3 A4D1 D2\\nFigure 6-14 Stacking Cables Between Access Switches in the Same Rack\\nptg17396363Key Topics  57\\nCisco’s stacking technologies require that Cisco plan to include stacking as a feature in a \\nproduct, given that it requires specific hardware. Cisco has a long history of building new \\nmodel series of switches with model numbers that begin with 2960. Per Cisco’s documenta-\\ntion, Cisco created one stacking technology, called FlexStack, as part of the introduction \\nof the 2960-S model series. Cisco later enhanced FlexStack with FlexStack-Plus, adding support with products in the 2960-X and 2960-XR model series. For switch stacking to sup-port future designs, the stacking hardware tends to increase over time as well, as seen in the \\ncomparisons between FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus in Table 6-3. \\nTable 6-3 Comparisons of Cisco’s FlexStack and FlexStack-Plus Options\\nFlexStack FlexStack-Plus\\nY ear introduced 2010 2013\\nSwitch model series 2960-S, 2960-X 2960-X, 2960-XR\\nSpeed of single stack link, in both directions (full \\nduplex)10 Gbps 20 Gbps\\nMaximum number of switches in one stack 4 8\\nptg1739636358  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe following list describes some of the advantages of using switch aggregation. Note that \\nmany of the benefits should sound familiar from the switch stacking discussion. The one \\ndifference in this list has to do with the active/active data plane.\\nMultichassis EtherChannel (MEC): Uses the EtherChannel between the two physical \\nswitches.\\nActive/Standby Control Plane: Simpler operation for control plane because the pair acts \\nas one switch for control plane protocols: STP, VTP, EtherChannel, ARP, routing proto-\\ncols.\\nActive/Active data plane: Takes advantage of forwarding power of supervisors on both \\nswitches, with active Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding the supervisors of both switches. The switches synchronize their MAC and routing tables to support that process.\\nSingle switch management: Simpler operation of management protocols by running man-\\nagement protocols (Telnet, SSH, SNMP) on the active switch; configuration is synchro-\\nnized automatically with the standby switch.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  59\\nChapter 7\\nCisco IOS software supports several IP routing protocols, performing the same general \\nfunctions:\\n1. Learn routing information about IP subnets from neighboring routers.\\n2. Advertise routing information about IP subnets to neighboring routers.\\n3. If more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based\\non a metric.\\n4. If the network topology changes—for example, a link fails—react by advertising thatsome routes have failed and pick a new currently best route. (This process is called\\nconvergence.)\\nptg1739636360  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIP routing protocols fall into one of two major categories: interior gateway protocols (IGP) \\nor exterior gateway protocols (EGP). The definitions of each are as follows:\\n■IGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use inside a single autono-\\nmous system (AS)\\n■EGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use between differentautonomous systems\\nptg17396363Key Topics  61\\nA routing protocol’s underlying algorithm determines how the routing protocol does its \\njob. The term routing protocol algorithm simply refers to the logic and processes used by \\ndifferent routing protocols to solve the problem of learning all routes, choosing the best \\nroute to each subnet, and converging in reaction to changes in the internetwork. Three main \\nbranches of routing protocol algorithms exist for IGP routing protocols:\\n■Distance vector (sometimes called Bellman-Ford after its creators)\\n■Advanced distance vector (sometimes called “balanced hybrid”)\\n■Link-state\\nptg1739636362  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRouting protocols choose the best route to reach a subnet by choosing the route with the \\nlowest metric. For example, RIP uses a counter of the number of routers (hops) between a \\nrouter and the destination subnet. OSPF totals the cost associated with each interface in the \\nend-to-end route, with the cost based on link bandwidth. Table 7-2 lists the most important \\nIP routing protocols for the CCNA exams and some details about the metric in each case.\\nTable 7-2 IP IGP Metrics\\nIGP Metric Description\\nRIP-2 Hop count The number of routers (hops) between a router and the \\ndestination subnet\\nOSPF Cost The sum of all interface cost settings for all links in a route, \\nwith the cost defaulting to be based on interface bandwidth\\nEIGRP Composite of \\nbandwidth and \\ndelayCalculated based on the route’s slowest link and the \\ncumulative delay associated with each interface in the route\\nptg17396363Key Topics  63\\nRouting protocols differ based on whether they are classless routing protocols or classful. \\nClassless routing protocols support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) as well as manual \\nroute summarization. Classless routing protocols support VLSM and manual route summa-\\nrization by sending routing protocol messages that include the subnet masks in the message, \\nwhereas the generally older classful routing protocols do not send masks in the routing update messages.

At that point, the following major \\nfacts are true:\\n■The router received a Hello from the neighbor, with that router’s own RID listed as being\\nseen by the neighbor.\\n■The router has checked all the parameters in the Hello received from the neighbor, with\\nno problems. The router is willing to become a neighbor.\\n■If both routers reach a 2-way state with each other, it means that both routers meet all\\nOSPF configuration requirements to become neighbors. Effectively, at that point, they\\nare neighbors, and ready to exchange their LSDB with each other.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  65\\nThis different behavior on OSPF neighbors on a LAN—where some neighbors reach full \\nstate and some do not—calls for the use of two more OSPF terms: adjacent and fully adja-\\ncent. Fully adjacent neighbors reach a full state after having exchanged their LSDBs directly. \\nAdjacent neighbors are those DROther routers that (correctly) choose to stay in 2-way state \\nbut never reach a full state.

To apply the rules, start with a clean draw-\\ning of the internetwork, with routers, and all interfaces. Then, choose the area for each \\nrouter interface, as follows:\\n■Put all interfaces connected to the same subnet inside the same area.\\n■An area should be contiguous.\\n■Some routers may be internal to an area, with all interfaces assigned to that single area.\\n■Some routers may be Area Border Routers (ABR), because some interfaces connect to\\nthe backbone area, and some connect to nonbackbone areas.\\n■All nonbackbone areas must connect to the backbone area (area 0) by having at least one\\nABR connected to both the backbone area and the nonbackbone area.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  69\\nFigure 7-13 shows one example.

The OSPF network command compares the \\nfirst parameter in the command to each interface IP address on the local router, trying to \\nfind a match. However, rather than comparing the entire number in the network command \\nto the entire IPv4 address on the interface, the router can compare a subset of the octets, \\nbased on the wildcard mask, as follows:\\nWildcard 0.0.0.0: Compare all 4 octets. In other words, the numbers must exactly match.\\nWildcard 0.0.0.255: Compare the first 3 octets only. Ignore the last octet when compar-\\ning the numbers.\\nWildcard 0.0.255.255: Compare the first 2 octets only.

Note that when one of these steps identifies the RID, the pro-\\ncess stops.\\n1. If the router-id rid OSPF subcommand is configured, this value is used as the RID.\\n2. If any loopback interfaces have an IP address configured, and the interface has an\\ninterface status of up, the router picks the highest numeric IP address among these\\nloopback interfaces.\\n3. The router picks the highest numeric IP address from all other interfaces whose inter-\\nface status code (first status code) is up. (In other words, an interface in up/down state\\nwill be included by OSPF when choosing its router ID.)\\nptg1739636374  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhen a router does not need to discover neighbors off some interface, the engineer has a \\ncouple of configuration options. First, by doing nothing, the router keeps sending the mes-\\nsages, wasting some small bit of CPU cycles and effort. Alternately, the engineer can config-\\nure the interface as an OSPF passive interface, telling the router to do the following:\\n■Quit sending OSPF Hellos on the interface.\\n■Ignore received Hellos on the interface.\\n■Do not form neighbor relationships over the interface.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  75\\nThe only router that has a multiarea config is an ABR, by virtue of the configuration refer-\\nring to more than one area. In this design (as shown in Figure 8-4), only Router R1 acts as an ABR, with interfaces in three different areas. Example 8-14 shows R1’s OSPF configuration. \\nNote that the configuration does not state anything about R1 being an ABR; instead, it uses \\nmultiple network commands, some placing interfaces into area 0, some into area 23, and \\nsome into area 4.\\nExample 8-14 OSPF Multiarea Configuration on Router R1\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n encapsulation dot1q 11\\n ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\n encapsulation dot1q 12\\n ip address 10.1.2.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1\\n ip address 10.1.14.1 255.255.255.0!\\ninterface serial 0/0/0\\n ip address 10.1.12.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\ninterface serial 0/0/1\\n ip address 10.1.13.1 255.255.255.0\\n!\\nrouter ospf 1\\n network 10.1.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0\\n network 10.1.2.1 0.0.0.0 area 0\\n network 10.1.12.1 0.0.0.0 area 23\\n network 10.1.13.1 0.0.0.0 area 23\\n network 10.1.14.1 0.0.0.0 area 4\\n router-id 1.1.1.1\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.11\\n passive-interface GigabitEthernet0/0.12\\nptg1739636376  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe next few pages look at how to verify a few of the new OSPF features introduced in this \\nchapter.

In this case, a company connects to an ISP with its Router R1. That router has \\na static default route (destination 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) with a next-hop address of the ISP \\nrouter.

Well, consider two key points about EIGRP that drive engineers toward wanting to use it:\\n■EIGRP uses a robust metric based on both link bandwidth and link delay, so routers\\nmake good choices about the best route to use (see Figure 9-2).\\n■EIGRP converges quickly, meaning that when something changes in the internetwork,\\nEIGRP quickly finds the currently best loop-free routes to use.\\nptg1739636382  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWhile Figure 9-3 shows how R1 learns the routes with RIP updates, Figure 9-4 gives a better \\nview into R1’s distance vector logic.

Figure 9-6 continues the same example as 9-5, but focusing on R1’s RIP update \\nsent out R1’s S0/0 interface to R2. This figure shows R1’s routing table with three light-\\ncolored routes, all of which list S0/0 as the outgoing interface. When building the RIP \\nupdate to send out S0/0, split-horizon rules tell R1 to ignore those light-colored routes, because all three routes list S0/0 as the outgoing interface. Only the bold route, which does not list S0/0 as an outgoing interface, can be included in the RIP update sent out S0/0.\\nG0/0 - 172.30.21.0 /24S0/1/0\\nS0/0G0/1 - 172.30.22.0 /24R1 IP Routing Table\\nSource\\nRIPRIPConn.Conn.Subnet172.30.21.0/24172.30.22.0/24172.30.1.0/24172.30.11.0/24Out Int.S0/0S0/0S0/0G0/0Next-Hop172.30.1.2172.30.1.2N/AN/AMetric1100\\nRIP UpdateOnly Bold Route Has Interface\\nOther Than S0/0\\n172.30.11.0, metric 1\\nR1 R2G0/0 - 172.30.11.0 /24 172.30.1.0 /24\\n172.30.1.2\\nFigure 9-6 R1 Does Not Advertise Three Routes Due to Split Horizon\\nptg1739636384  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 9-2 summarizes the features discussed in this chapter, for RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPFv2. \\nFollowing the table, the second major section of this chapter begins, which moves into \\ndepth about the specifics of how EIGRP works.\\nTable 9-2 Interior IP Routing Protocols Compared\\nFeature RIPv2 EIGRP OSPFv2\\nMetric is based on Hop count Bandwidth and \\ndelayCost\\nSends periodic full updates Y es No No\\nSends periodic Hello messages No Y es Y es\\nUses route poisoning for failed routes Y es Y es Y es\\nUses split horizon to limit updates \\nabout working routesYe s Ye s No\\nAddress to which messages are sent 224.0.0.9 224.0.0.10 224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6\\nMetric considered to be infinite 16 232 – 1 224 – 1\\nptg17396363Key Topics  85\\nOnce another EIGRP router is discovered using Hello messages, routers must perform some \\nbasic checking of each potential neighbor before that router becomes an EIGRP neighbor. \\n(A potential neighbor is a router from which an EIGRP Hello has been received.)

With EIGRP, a local router needs to consider its own calculated metric for each \\nroute, but at the same time, the local router considers the next-hop router’s calculated met-\\nric for that same destination subnet. And EIGRP has special terms for those metrics, as fol-\\nlows:\\n■Feasible distance (FD): The local router’s composite metric of the best route to reach a\\nsubnet, as calculated on the local router\\n■Reported distance (RD): The next-hop router’s best composite metric for that samesubnet\\nptg1739636388  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nA router determines whether a route is a feasible successor based on the feasibility condi-\\ntion:\\nIf a nonsuccessor route’s RD is less than the FD, the route is a feasible successor route.\\nAlthough it is technically correct, this definition is much more understandable with an \\nexample. Figure 9-13 begins an example in which router E chooses its best route to subnet \\n1. Router E learns three routes to subnet 1, with next-hop routers B, C, and D. The figureshows the metrics as calculated on router E, as listed in router E’s EIGRP topology table. Router E finds that the route through router D has the lowest metric, making that router E’s \\nsuccessor route for subnet 1. Router E adds that route to its routing table, as shown. The \\nFD is the metric calculated for this route, a value of 14,000 in this case.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  89\\nFigure 9-14 demonstrates that one of the two other routes meets the feasibility condition \\nand is therefore a feasible successor route. The figure shows an updated version of Figure \\n9-13. Router E uses the following logic to determine that the route through router B is not a \\nfeasible successor route, but the route through router C is, as follows:\\n■Router E compares the FD of 14,000 to the RD of the route through router B (15,000).\\nRouter B’s RD is worse than router E’s FD, so this route is not a feasible successor.\\n■Router E compares the FD of 14,000 to the RD of the route through router C (13,000).\\nRouter C’s RD is better than router E’s FD, making this route a feasible successor.\\nSubnet 1\\nRouter E Routing Table\\nSubnet 1 Metric 14,000 , Through DFeas.

For instance, it lists the \\nEIGRP router ID (RID), which for R1 is 10.1.5.1. EIGRP allocates its RID just like OSPF, \\nbased on the following:\\n1. The value configured with the eigrp router-id number EIGRP subcommand\\n2. The numerically highest IP address of an up/up loopback interface at the time the\\nEIGRP process comes up\\n3.

(BGP does use \\na network command, but for a different purpose.) BGP does form neighbor relationships, \\nbut BGP has no concept of being enabled on an interface, or of dynamically discovering \\nneighbors. Instead, with BGP:\\n■Predefine neighbors with the neighbor ip-address remote-as asn BGP subcommand\\n■Advertise about prefixes that have been added to the BGP table using\\n■The BGP network command\\n■Route redistribution\\n■By learning preﬁ  xes from a neighbor\\nptg17396363Key Topics  109\\nOf these, only the bgp peer-ip-address remote-as command is required.

Remember, from earlier Figure 12-10, that BGP must also add entries to its BGP table before it can then advertise that entry \\n(NLRI and associated PAs). With the configuration so far, Routers R1 and ISP1 should be \\neBGP peers, but not yet have any BGP table entries to send to each other. Example 12-2 shows some sample output to confirm the neighbor relationship, and to confirm that BGP has an empty BGP table.

On the telco side, that means the CSU connects to the line \\nfrom the telco, so it must understand all these details about the T-carrier system, TDM, \\nand the speed used by the telco. On the router side of the equation, the CSU connects to \\nthe router, with roles called the DCE and DTE, respectively. The CSU, acting as DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment), controls the speed of the router serial interface. The router, acting as DTE (data terminal equipment), is controlled by the clocking signals from the CSU \\n(DCE). That is, the CSU tells the router when to send and receive bits; the router attempts \\nto send and receive bits only when the DCE creates the correct electrical impulses (called \\nclocking) on the cable. Figure 13-7 shows a diagram of those main concepts of the role of the CSU/DSU.\\nCSU/\\nDSU– Send When Clocked\\n– Receive When Clocked– Use Clocking to Control Router– Use Configured Speed\\nDTE DCESerial CableClock Signals\\nFigure 13-7 DCE and DTE Roles for a CSU/DSU and a Router Serial Interface\\nptg17396363114  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPPP provides several basic but important functions that are useful on a leased line that con-\\nnects two devices:\\n■Definition of a header and trailer that allows delivery of a data frame over the link\\n■Support for both synchronous and asynchronous links\\n■A protocol Type field in the header, allowing multiple Layer 3 protocols to pass over the\\nsame link\\n■Built-in authentication tools: Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge\\nHandshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)\\n■Control protocols for each higher-layer protocol that rides over PPP, allowing easier\\nintegration and support of those protocols\\nptg17396363Key Topics  115\\nPPP separates these control protocols into two main categories:\\n■Link Control Protocol (LCP): This one protocol has several different individual func-\\ntions, each focused on the data link itself, ignoring the Layer 3 protocol sent across the\\nlink.\\n■Network Control Protocols (NCP): This is a category of protocols, one per network\\nlayer protocol.

Both protocols require the \\nexchange of messages between devices, but with different details.

The big difference is that the second message \\nin the flow (as shown in Figure 13-14) hides the authentication password by instead sending \\na hashed version of the password. Router Fred has been preconfigured with Barney’s name and password in such a way that Fred can confirm that the hashed password sent by Barney is indeed the same password that Fred lists in his configuration for Barney. If the password \\nis indeed the correct password, Fred sends back a third message to confirm the successful \\nauthentication of Barney.\\nI Am #$%#$@Ask Other Router\\nFred\\n(Authenticating)React to Challenge\\nBarney\\n(Being Authenticated)Challenge! 1\\nAccepted 32\\nFigure 13-14 CHAP Authentication Process\\nptg17396363118  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nPAP configuration differs from CHAP configuration in a couple of ways. First, PAP uses \\nthe similar authentication ppp pap command instead of the authentication ppp chap com-\\nmand. Then, PAP configures the sent username/password pair much differently than CHAP. \\nA router defines the username/password pair it will send using the ppp pap sent-username \\ncommand, configured as an interface subcommand. Once sent, the other router receives \\nthat username/password pair, and compares those values with its various username password global commands.

So first, to set the context a bit, think about these main three configuration require-\\nments for MLPPP: \\nStep 1. Configure matching multilink interfaces on the two routers, configuring the \\ninterface subcommands for all Layer 3 features (IPv4, IPv6, and routing proto-\\ncol) under the multilink interfaces (and not on the serial interfaces).\\nStep 2. Configure the serial interfaces with all Layer 1 and 2 commands, like clock rate \\n(Layer 1) and ppp authentication (Layer 2).\\nStep 3.

The interface multilink 1 command on each router creates \\nthe multilink interface on that router. The network engineer chooses the interface number, \\nbut the number must be the same on both routers, or the link will not work. Additionally, \\nthe multilink interfaces and the physical serial interfaces must all have both a ppp multilink group 1 command, and they must all again refer to that same number (1 in this example).

To keep costs lower the SP puts a device (typically an Ethernet switch) physically near to as many customer sites as possible, in an SP facility called a point of presence \\n(PoP). Those SP switches need to be near enough to many customer locations so that some Ethernet standard supports the distance from the SP’s PoP to each customer site.

For instance, you do not need to know how MPLS labels work. However, \\nbecause MPLS VPNs create a Layer 3 service, the customer must be more aware of what the \\nSP does, so you need to know a few facts about how an MPLS network approaches some \\nLayer 3 functions. In particular, the SP’s MPLS network: \\n■Needs to know about the customer’s IP subnets\\n■Will run IP routing protocols to learn those routes\\n■Will use routes about the customer’s IP address space to make forwarding decisions\\nptg17396363126  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nMPLS provides a Layer 3 service in that it promises to forward Layer 3 packets (IPv4 and \\nIPv6). To support that service, MPLS SPs typically use routers at the edge of the MPLS net-\\nworks, because routers provide the function of forwarding Layer 3 packets. \\nAs usual, each WAN technology has its own set of terms and acronyms, so Figure 14-15 \\nshows two important MPLS terms in context: customer edge (CE) and provider edge (PE). \\nBecause MPLS requires so much discussion about the devices on the edge of the customer \\nand SP network, MPLS uses specific terms for each. The customer edge (CE) device is typi-\\ncally a router, and it sits at a customer site—that is, at a site in the company that is buying the MPLS service. The provider edge (PE) devices sit at the edge of the SP’s network, on the other end of the access link. \\n10.1.1.0/24\\nMPLS:\\nHidden\\nDetailsCustomer\\nEdgeCustomer\\nEdge\\nProvider Edge10.1.2.0/24\\n10.1.3.0/24 10.1.4.0/24R1 R2\\nR4 R3\\nFigure 14-15 MPLS Layer 3 Design, with PE and CE Routers\\nptg17396363Key Topics  127\\nAdditionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routers. However, a \\nCE router does not form routing protocol neighbor relationships directly with the other CE \\nrouters, as noted in Figure 14-18. Summarizing what does and does not happen: \\n■A CE router does become neighbors with the PE router on the other end of the access\\nlink.\\n■A CE router does not become neighbors with other CE routers.\\n■The MPLS network will advertise the customer’s routes between the various PE routers,\\nso that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing proto-\\ncol neighbor relationship.\\nptg17396363128  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nMPLS allows for a couple of variations on OSPF area design, but they all use an idea that \\nwas added to OSPF for MPLS VPNs, an idea that has come to be known informally as \\nthe OSPF super backbone.

The challenge with GRE configu-\\nration comes in organizing the configuration parameters. The configuration requires a tunnel \\ninterface, with IP addresses from the secured part of the network configured with the ip \\naddress interface command. It also requires that the two routers declare both their own IP \\naddress (source) and the other router’s IP address (destination), used in the unsecure part of the network.

For the tunnel to work, the tunnel interfac-\\nes on the endpoint routers must both reach an up/up state. To reach an up/up state, a tunnel \\ninterface must be configured with a tunnel source command and a tunnel destination com-\\nmand. Additionally, the following must be true of the tunnel source:\\n1. If configuring the tunnel source command by referencing a source interface, the\\ninterface must\\n■Have an IP address assigned to it\\n■Be in an up/up state\\n2. If configuring the tunnel source command by referencing a source IP address, the\\naddress must\\n■Be an address assigned to an interface on the local router\\n■Be in an up/up state for that interface on which the address is conﬁ  gured\\nIn short, however it is referenced, the tunnel source must be an IP address on the local \\nrouter on a currently working interface. If that is not true, the tunnel interface will remain in an up/down state. (Note that when a tunnel interface is created, it begins with an up/down \\nstate, because it has neither a tunnel source nor tunnel destination configured by default.)\\nptg17396363Key Topics  135\\nA router’s tunnel interface state is also impacted by the tunnel destination configuration, \\nbut those details can be a little trickier. Some settings cause IOS to accept the configuration, \\nbut cause the tunnel interface to not reach an up/up state. Other incorrect tunnel \\ndestination configuration settings cause IOS to reject the configuration. Those checks are\\n1. If configuring the tunnel destination command by referencing a destination IP\\naddress, the router\\n■Must have a matching route to the destination address, or IOS will not move the\\ntunnel interface to an up/up state\\n■May use its default route as the matching route\\n2. If configuring the tunnel destination command by referencing a hostname, the router\\nimmediately attempts to resolve the name into an address per its name resolution set-\\ntings. If:\\n■The hostname does not resolve to an IP address, IOS rejects the tunnel destination\\ncommand and does not store it in the conﬁ  guration.\\n■The hostname does resolve to an IP address, IOS stores that IP address in the tunnel\\ndestination command in the conﬁ  guration, and does not store the hostname. Then\\nthe earlier rules about the tunnel destination IP address apply.\\nptg17396363136  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nToday, dialer interfaces act as logical interfaces that can be dynamically bound to use \\nanother interface. These interfaces cooperate to perform a function. For instance, for \\nPPPoE, the dialer interface holds configuration for IP and PPP, but it is not a physical \\nEthernet interface. So, to let the dialer interface use G0/1 as the physical interface in this \\nscenario:\\n■The configuration puts interface G0/1 into a dial pool, specifically numbered dial pool 1,\\nper the pppoe-client dial-pool-number 1 command. This command means that G0/1 is\\navailable to be used by dialer interfaces wanting to do PPPoE.\\n■Dialer interface 2 references dial pool number 1 with the dialer-pool 1 command.\\nBecause the dial pool number matches, interface dialer 2 will use G0/1 for PPPoE.\\nNote that the dialer interface number (2 in this case) and dialer pool number (1 in this case) \\ndo not have to match. The customer network engineer can just choose an integer value to use; they do not have to match the ISP router. However, the dial pool number listed by \\nthe dialer-pool command on the dialer interface, and the dial pool number listed by the \\npppoe-client dial-pool-number subcommand on the physical interface, must match.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  137\\nThe configuration of the dial pool gives the logical dialer interface a physical interface to \\nuse, so it is in some ways a physical layer (Layer 1) feature. In fact, you can break down \\nall of Example 15-9’s configuration into groupings by Layers 1, 2, and 3, a theme carried \\nthrough the rest of this section.

Before reviewing a \\nbunch of command output, it helps to get an idea about those internals. So, consider the \\nideas in Figure 15-26. The figure shows the two familiar interfaces from the configuration \\nsection, namely, a dialer interface and Ethernet interface. It adds two boxes for discussion:\\nPPPoE Session: A reference to the IOS internal process that performs the PPPoE work \\nand keeps status variables for the PPPoE control protocols\\nVirtual-Access Interface: Another logical interface, dynamically created by IOS once the \\nPPPoE session is up and working, and bound to the dialer interface\\nDialer Interface\\nDial Pool #Bind\\nUpPPP Config\\npppoe enableBindVirtual-Access\\nInterfacePPPoE\\nSession\\nEthernet Interface12\\n3\\n24\\n4\\nFigure 15-26 PPPoE Verification Concepts and Interfaces\\nptg17396363Key Topics  139\\nThe sections about PPPoE verification and troubleshooting show a lot of command exam-\\nples. This section summarizes a few suggestions for what to look for to help with review and \\nexam preparation.\\nLayer 1: If the show pppoe session [ interface type number] command does not list out-\\nput, or does not list both the physical and dialer interfaces, check for the existence of the \\nLayer 1 commands as noted in Figure 15-28. Check for errors in those commands as well; for instance, the dial pool numbers must match. Also check to make sure both the dialer \\nand physical interfaces are not shut down. (See Example 15-16.)\\nLayer 2: If the show pppoe session [ interface type number] command does list output, \\nand lists the physical and dialer interfaces, but no Vi interface, check the Layer 2 configu-\\nration as noted in Figure 15-28. Those could be missing, or there could be mistakes. For instance, something as simple as a mistyped CHAP password ends with this result. (See \\nExample 15-17.)\\nLayer 2: If the show interfaces dialer number command lists an interface status (the first \\nstatus value) of up (spoofing), that is another confirmation that PPPoE is not yet working. \\nIf so, check the PPP configuration on the dialer interface, and confirm the username/pass-word matches with what the ISP requires. (See Example 15-18.)\\nLayer 2: To be confident PPPoE is working, look for three items, all seen in Example \\n15-18’s show pppoe session command output:\\n■A status of UP\\n■Three interfaces listed in shorthand: the Ethernet interface (Gi0/1 in the example),\\nthe dialer interface (Di2), and the virtual-access interface (Vi1)\\n■The MAC addresses of the two routers; check the local MAC address with a show\\ninterfaces command on the local router\\nLayer 3: If the show interfaces or show ip interface brief command does not list an IP address for the dialer interface, then look for missing or incorrect Layer 3 commands per \\nFigure 15-28.\\nptg17396363140  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nHere are a couple of possible false positives to avoid as well:\\nDialer interface status: If the show interfaces dialer number command lists a protocol \\nstatus (the second status value) of up (spoofing), do not be concerned. It will always list \\nthat status, both when working and not working. (See Example 15-18.)\\nPhysical interface IP address: The physical Ethernet interface will not have an IP address. \\nIt is used to send Ethernet frames only. So, it is appropriate with PPPoE to configure the \\nphysical Ethernet interface with the no ip address command.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  141\\nChapter 16\\nIn short, to filter a packet, you must enable an ACL on an interface that processes the pack-\\net, in the same direction the packet flows through that interface.\\nptg17396363142  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nBriefly, IP ACLs will be either numbered or named in that the configuration identifies the \\nACL either using a number or a name. ACLs will also be either standard or extended, with \\nextended ACLs having much more robust abilities in matching packets.

Once a packet matches one line in the ACL, the router takes \\nthe action listed in that line of the ACL, and stops looking further in the ACL.\\nptg17396363144  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nYou can think about WC masks in decimal and in binary, and both have their uses. To \\nbegin, think about WC masks in decimal, using these rules:\\nDecimal 0: The router must compare this octet as normal.\\nDecimal 255: The router ignores this octet, considering it to already match.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  145\\nIn many cases, an ACL needs to match all hosts in a particular subnet. To match a subnet \\nwith an ACL, you can use the following shortcut:\\n■Use the subnet number as the source value in the access-list command.\\n■Use a wildcard mask found by subtracting the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\\nptg17396363146  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThis chapter has already introduced all the configuration steps in bits and pieces. This sec-\\ntion summarizes those pieces as a configuration process. The process also refers to the \\naccess-list command, whose generic syntax is repeated here for reference:\\naccess-list access-list-number {deny | permit} source [source-wildcard]\\nStep 1. Plan the location (router and interface) and direction (in or out) on that inter-\\nface:\\nA. Standard ACLs should be placed near to the destination of the packets \\nso that they do not unintentionally discard packets that should not be \\ndiscarded.\\nB. Because standard ACLs can only match a packet’s source IP address, \\nidentify the source IP addresses of packets as they go in the direction \\nthat the ACL is examining.\\nStep 2. Configure one or more access-list global configuration commands to create \\nthe ACL, keeping the following in mind:\\nA. The list is searched sequentially, using first-match logic.\\nB. The default action, if a packet does not match any of the access-list \\ncommands, is to deny (discard) the packet.\\nStep 3. Enable the ACL on the chosen router interface, in the correct direction, using \\nthe ip access-group number { in | out} interface subcommand.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  147\\nFirst, the following list summarizes some important tips to consider when choosing match-\\ning parameters to any access-list command:\\n■To match a specific address, just list the address.\\n■To match any and all addresses, use the any keyword.\\n■To match based only on the first one, two, or three octets of an address, use the\\n0.255.255.255, 0.0.255.255, and 0.0.0.255 WC masks, respectively. Also, make the\\nsource (address) parameter have 0s in the wildcard octets (those octets with 255 in the\\nwildcard mask).\\n■To match a subnet, use the subnet ID as the source, and find the WC mask by subtract-\\ning the DDN subnet mask from 255.255.255.255.\\nptg17396363148  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 17\\nIOS requires that you configure parameters for the three highlighted parts of Figure 17-2. \\nFor the protocol type, you simply use a keyword, such as tcp, udp, or icmp, matching IP \\npackets that happen to have a TCP, UDP, or ICMP header, respectively, following the IP \\nheader. Or you can use the keyword ip, which means “all IPv4 packets.” You also must con-\\nfigure some values for the source and destination IP address fields that follow; these fields use the same syntax and options for matching the IP addresses as discussed in Chapter 16, “Basic IPv4 Access Control Lists.” Figure 17-3 shows the syntax.\\nKeyword Address & Wildcard\\n100 -   199\\n2000 - 2699 Matching\\nOptionsaccess-list 101 permit source_IP protocol dest_IP\\nip\\ntcpudpicmpothers...\\nFigure 17-3 Extended ACL Syntax, with Required Fields\\nptg17396363Key Topics  149\\nIn an extended ACL access-list command, all the matching parameters must match the \\npacket for the packet to match the command.\\nptg17396363150  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe most useful ports to check are the well-known ports used by servers. For example, web \\nservers use well-known port 80 by default. Figure 17-4 shows the location of the port num-\\nbers in the TCP header, following the IP header.\\nIP Header TCP Header\\nMiscellaneous\\nHeader\\nFieldsProtocol\\n6 (TCP)Header\\nChecksumSource IP\\nAddressDestination IP\\nAddressOptionsSource\\nPortDest.\\nPortRest\\nof\\nTCP9 1 2 4 4 Variable 2 2 16+\\n6 = TCP\\nFigure 17-4 IP Header, Followed by a TCP Header and Port Number Fields\\nptg17396363Key Topics  151\\nWhen an extended ACL command includes either the tcp or udp keyword, that command \\ncan optionally reference the source and/or destination port. To make these comparisons, \\nthe syntax uses keywords for equal, not equal, less than, greater than, and for a range of \\nport numbers. In addition, the command can use either the literal decimal port numbers, or \\nmore convenient keywords for some well-known application ports.

In this case, the packet’s TCP header has a source port of 21, so the ACL must \\ncheck the source port value of 21, and the ACL must be located on different interfaces.

You must choose the location and direction in which to enable the ACL, \\nparticularly the direction, so that you can characterize whether certain addresses and ports \\nwill be either the source or destination. Configure the ACL using access-list commands, \\nand when complete, then enable the ACL using the same ip access-group command used \\nwith standard ACLs. All these steps mirror what you do with standard ACLs; however, when \\nconfiguring, keep the following differences in mind:\\n■Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packets that will be fil-\\ntered. Filtering close to the source of the packets saves some bandwidth.\\n■Remember that all fields in one access-list command must match a packet for the packet\\nto be considered to match that access-list statement.\\n■Use numbers of 100–199 and 2000–2699 on the access-list commands; no one number\\nis inherently better than another.\\nptg17396363154  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThere are differences between named and numbered ACLs. Named ACLs originally had \\nthree big differences compared to numbered ACLs:\\n■Using names instead of numbers to identify the ACL, making it easier to remember the\\nreason for the ACL\\n■Using ACL subcommands, not global commands, to define the action and matching\\nparameters\\n■Using ACL editing features that allow the CLI user to delete individual lines from the\\nACL and insert new lines\\nptg17396363Key Topics  155\\nThe ACL editing feature uses an ACL sequence number that is added to each ACL permit \\nor deny statement, with the numbers representing the sequence of statements in the ACL. \\nACL sequence numbers provide the following features for both numbered and named \\nACLs:\\nNew configuration style for numbered: Numbered ACLs use a configuration style like \\nnamed ACLs, as well as the traditional style, for the same ACL; the new style is required \\nto perform advanced ACL editing.\\nDeleting single lines: An individual ACL permit or deny statement can be deleted with a \\nno sequence-number subcommand.\\nInserting new lines: Newly added permit and deny commands can be configured with \\na sequence number before the deny or permit command, dictating the location of the \\nstatement within the ACL.\\nAutomatic sequence numbering: IOS adds sequence numbers to commands as you con-\\nfigure them, even if you do not include the sequence numbers.\\nptg17396363156  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nACLs can be a great tool to enhance the security of a network, but engineers should think \\nabout some broader issues before simply configuring an ACL to fix a problem. To help, \\nCisco makes the following general recommendations in the courses on which the CCNA \\nR&S exams are based:\\n■Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packet. This strategy\\nallows ACLs to discard the packets early.\\n■Place standard ACLs as close as possible to the destination of the packet. This strategy\\navoids the mistake with standard ACLs (which match the source IPv4 address only) of\\nunintentionally discarding packets that did not need to be discarded.\\n■Place more specific statements early in the ACL.\\n■Disable an ACL from its interface (using the no ip access-group interface subcommand)\\nbefore making changes to the ACL.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  157\\nThe following phrases the ACL troubleshooting steps into a list for easier study. The list \\nalso expands on the idea of analyzing each ACL in Step 3. None of the ideas in the list are \\nnew compared to this chapter and the previous chapter, but it acts more as a summary of \\nthe common issues:\\nStep 1. Determine on which interfaces ACLs are enabled, and in which direction (show \\nrunning-config, show ip interfaces).\\nStep 2. Find the configuration of each ACL (show access-lists, show ip access-lists, show running-config).\\nStep 3. Analyze the ACLs to predict which packets should match the ACL, focusing on the following points:\\nA. Misordered ACLs: Look for mis-ordered ACL statements. IOS uses first-match logic when searching an ACL.\\nB. Reversed source/destination addresses: Analyze the router interface, the direction in which the ACL is enabled, compared to the location of \\nthe IP address ranges matched by the ACL statements. Make sure the \\nsource IP address field could match packets with that source IP address, rather than the destination, and vice versa for the destination IP address \\nfield. \\nC. Reversed source/destination ports: For extended ACLs that reference \\nUDP or TCP port numbers, continue to analyze the location and direc-\\ntion of the ACL versus the hosts, focusing on which host acts as server \\nusing a well known port. Ensure that the ACL statement matches the \\ncorrect source or destination port depending on whether the server sent \\nor will receive the packet.\\nD. Syntax: Remember that extended ACL commands must use the tcp and \\nudp keywords if the command needs to check the port numbers.\\nE. Syntax: Note that ICMP packets do not use UDP or TCP; ICMP is considered to be another protocol matchable with the icmp keyword \\n(instead of tcp or udp).\\nF. Explicit deny any: Instead of using the implicit deny any at the end of \\neach ACL, use an explicit configuration command to deny all traffic at the end of the ACL so that the show command counters increment \\nwhen that action is taken.\\nG. Dangerous inbound ACLs: Watch for inbound ACLs, especially those with deny all logic at the end of the ACL. These ACLs may discard \\nincoming overhead protocols, like routing protocol messages.\\nH. Standard ACL location: Standard ACLs enabled close to the source of \\nmatched addresses can discard the packets as intended, but also discard \\npackets that should be allowed through. Always pay close attention to \\nthe requirements of the ACL in these cases.\\nptg17396363158  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nRouters bypass their own outbound ACLs for packets generated by the router, as shown in \\nFigure 17-13.

All these tools give \\nyou the means to manage four characteristics of network traffic:\\n■Bandwidth\\n■Delay\\n■Jitter\\n■Loss\\nptg17396363160  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nYou can achieve good-quality voice traffic over an IP network, but you must implement \\nQoS to do so. QoS tools set about to give different types of traffic the QoS behavior they \\nneed. Cisco’s Enterprise QoS Solution Reference Network Design Guide, which itself \\nquotes other sources in addition to relying on Cisco’s long experience in implementing \\nQoS, suggests the following guidelines for interactive voice:\\n■Delay (one-way): 150 ms or less\\n■Jitter: 30 ms or less\\n■Loss: 1% or less\\nptg17396363Key Topics  161\\nVideo has a much more varied set of QoS requirements. Generally, think of video like \\nvoice, but with a much higher bandwidth requirement than voice (per flow), and similar \\nrequirements for low delay, jitter, and loss. As for bandwidth, video can use a variety of \\ncodecs that impact the amount of data sent, but many other technical features impact the \\namount of bandwidth required for a single video flow. (For instance, a sporting event with lots of movement on screen takes more bandwidth than a news anchor reading the news in front of a solid background with little movement.) This time quoting from End-to-End QoS \\nNetwork Design, Second Edition (Cisco Press, 2013), some requirements for video include\\n■Bandwidth: 384 Kbps to 20+ Mbps\\n■Delay (one-way): 200–400 ms\\n■Jitter: 30–50 ms\\n■Loss: 0.1%–1%\\nptg17396363162  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 header, as shown in Figure 18-6. The \\noriginal RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking.

DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, \\nallowing for 64 unique values that can be marked.

This field sits in the third byte of the 4-byte 802.1Q header, as a \\n3-bit field, supplying eight possible values to mark (see Figure 18-7).

Most networking devices can \\nhave a queuing system with multiple queues. To use multiple queues, the queuing system \\nneeds a classifier function to choose which packets are placed into which queue. (The clas-\\nsifier can react to previously marked values, or do a more extensive match.) The queuing \\nsystem needs a scheduler as well, to decide which message to take next when the interface becomes available, as shown in Figure 18-14.\\nClassifier\\nTransmitQueues Scheduler\\nFigure 18-14 Congestion Management (Queuing) Components\\nptg17396363166  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe solution, LLQ, tells the scheduler to treat one or more queues as special priority \\nqueues. The LLQ scheduler always takes the next message from one of these special prior-\\nity queues. Problem solved: very little delay for packets in that queue, resulting in very little jitter as well. Plus the queue never has time to fill up, so there are no drops due to the queue filling up.

Use a round robin queuing method like CBWFQ for data classes and for noninterac-\\ntive voice and video.\\n2. If faced with too little bandwidth compared to the typical amount of traffic, give data\\nclasses that support business-critical applications much more guaranteed bandwidth\\nthan is given to less important data classes.\\n3. Use a priority queue with LLQ scheduling for interactive voice and video, to achieve\\nlow delay, jitter, and loss.\\n4. Put voice in a separate queue from video, so that the policing function applies sepa-rately to each.\\n5. Define enough bandwidth for each priority queue so that the built-in policer shouldnot discard any messages from the priority queues.\\n6. Use Call Admission Control (CAC) tools to avoid adding too much voice or video tothe network, which would trigger the policer function.\\nptg17396363168  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nShapers and policers monitor the traffic rate (the bits/second that move through the shaper \\nor policer) versus a configured shaping rate or policing rate, respectively.

Each 802.1Q trunk has one native VLAN, and if the router \\nneeds to route packets for a subnet that exists in the native VLAN, then the router needs \\nsome configuration to support that subnet. The two options to define a router interface for the native VLAN are\\n■Configure the ip address command on the physical interface, but without an\\nencapsulation command; the router considers this physical interface to be using the\\nnative VLAN.\\n■Configure the ip address command on a subinterface, and use the encapsulation dot1q\\nvlan-id native subcommand to tell the router both the VLAN ID and the fact that it isthe native VLAN.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  173\\nFirst, to check ROAS on the router, you need to start with the intended configuration, and \\nask questions about the configuration:\\n1. Is each non-native VLAN configured on the router with an encapsulation dot1q\\nvlan-id command on a subinterface?\\n2. Do those same VLANs exist on the trunk on the neighboring switch ( show interfaces\\ntrunk), and are they in the allowed list, not VTP pruned, and not STP blocked?\\n3. Does each router ROAS subinterface have an IP address/mask configured per the\\nplanned configuration?\\n4. If using the native VLAN, is it configured correctly on the router either on a subinter-\\nface (with an encapsulation dot1q vlan-id native command) or implied on the physi-\\ncal interface?\\n5. Is the same native VLAN configured on the neighboring switch’s trunk?\\n6. Are the router physical or ROAS subinterfaces configured with a shutdown com-\\nmand?\\nptg17396363174  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo show the concept of Layer 3 switching with SVIs, Figure 19-3 shows the design changes \\nand configuration concept for the same branch office used in Figures 19-1 and 19-2. The \\nfigure shows the Layer 3 switch function with a router icon inside the switch, to emphasize \\nthat the switch routes the packets. The branch still has two user VLANs, so the Layer 3 \\nswitch needs one VLAN interface for each VLAN. In addition, the traffic still needs to get to the router to access the WAN, so the switch uses a third VLAN (VLAN 30 in this case) for the link to Router B1. This link would not be a trunk, but would be an access link.\\nVLAN 20interface vlan 20\\n10.1.20.1/24interface vlan 10\\n10.1.10.1/24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 30\\ninterface vlan 3010.1.30.1/24 G0/010.1.30.2\\nB1The Middle Box Represents the Layer 3 Switch,\\nwith Internal Logic Visible\\nG0/1F0/1\\nF0/2\\nF0/3\\nF0/4\\nFigure 19-3 Routing on VLAN Interfaces in a Layer 3 Switch\\nptg17396363Key Topics  175\\nThe second big area to investigate when troubleshooting SVIs relates to the SVI state, a \\nstate that ties to the state of the associated VLANs. Each VLAN interface has a matching \\nVLAN of the same number, and the VLAN interface’s state is tied to the state of the VLAN \\nin certain ways. In particular, for a VLAN interface to be in an up/up state:\\nStep 1. The VLAN must be defined on the local switch (either explicitly, or learned \\nwith VTP).\\nStep 2. The switch must have at least one up/up interface using the VLAN, either/\\nboth:\\nA. An up/up access interface assigned to that VLAN\\nB. A trunk interface for which the VLAN is in the allowed list, is STP for-\\nwarding, and is not VTP pruned\\nStep 3.

The VLAN interface (not the VLAN) must be administratively enabled (that is, \\nnot shutdown).\\nptg17396363176  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo see why, consider the design in Figure 19-4, which repeats the same design from Figure \\n19-3 (used in the SVI examples). In that familiar design, at least two access ports sit in both \\nVLAN 10 and VLAN 20. However, that figure shows a single link from the switch to Router \\nB1. As a result, the switch could configure that link as a routed port.\\nVLAN 20interface vlan 20\\n10.1.20.1/24interface vlan 10\\n10.1.10.1/24VLAN 10\\nVLAN 30\\ninterface G0/1\\n10.1.30.1/24G0/010.1.30.2B1The Middle Box Represents \\nthe Layer 3 Switch\\nF0/1\\nF0/2\\nF0/3\\nF0/4Routed\\nInterface\\nFigure 19-4 Routing on a Routed Interface on a Switch\\nptg17396363Key Topics  177\\nOnce configured, the routed interface will show up differently in command output in the \\nswitch. In particular, for an interface configured as a routed port with an IP address, like \\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/1 in the previous example:\\nshow interfaces: Similar to the same command on a router, the output will display the IP \\naddress of the interface. (For switch ports, this command does not list an IP address.)\\nshow interfaces status: Under the “VLAN” heading, instead of listing the access VLAN \\nor the word “trunk,” the output lists the word “routed,” meaning that it is a routed port.\\nshow ip route: Lists the routed port as an outgoing interface in routes. \\nshow interfaces type number switchport: If a routed port, the output is short and con-\\nfirms that the port is not a switch port.

For the purposes of understanding the technology, you may treat \\nthese terms as synonyms. However, it helps to pay close attention to the use of the terms \\nport channel and EtherChannel as you work through the examples in this section, because \\nIOS uses both.\\nExample 19-12 shows an example of the configuration for a Layer 3 EtherChannel for \\nswitch SW1 in Figure 19-7.

Layer 2 EtherChannels \\nhave a longer list of requirements, but Layer 3 EtherChannels do require a few consistency \\nchecks between the ports before they can be added to the EtherChannel. The following is \\nthe list of requirements for Layer 3 EtherChannels:\\nno switchport: The port-channel interface must be configured with the no switch-\\nport command, and so must the physical interfaces. If a physical interface is not also \\nconfigured with the no switchport command, it will not become operational in the \\nEtherChannel.\\nSpeed: The physical ports in the channel must use the same speed. \\nduplex: The physical ports in the channel must use the same duplex.\\nptg17396363180  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 20\\nTo allow the hosts to remain unchanged, the routers have to do some more work, as defined \\nby one of the FHRP protocols. Generically, each FHRP makes the following happen:\\n1. All hosts act like they always have, with one default router setting that never has to\\nchange.\\n2. The default routers share a virtual IP address in the subnet, defined by the FHRP.\\n3. Hosts use the FHRP virtual IP address as their default router address.\\n4. The routers exchange FHRP protocol messages, so that both agree as to which router\\ndoes what work at any point in time.\\n5. When a router fails, or has some other problem, the routers use the FHRP to choose\\nwhich router takes over responsibilities from the failed router.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  181\\nHosts refer to the virtual IP address as their default router address, instead of any one \\nrouter’s interface IP address. For instance, in Figure 20-5, R1 and R2 use HSRP.

In particu-\\nlar, based on the headings, the show standby brief command identifies the following:\\nInterface: The local router’s interface on which the HSRP group is configured\\nGrp: The HSRP group number\\nPri: The local router’s HSRP priorityState: The local router’s current HSRP state\\nActive: The interface IP address of the currently active HSRP router (or “local” if the \\nlocal router is HSRP active)\\nStandby: The interface IP address of the currently standby HSRP router (or “local” if the \\nlocal router is HSRP standby)\\nVirtual IP: The virtual IP address defined by this router for this group\\nptg17396363184  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFirst, the HSRP rules. When a router (call it the local router) has an HSRP-enabled interface, \\nand that interface comes up, the router sends HSRP messages to negotiate whether it should \\nbe active or standby. When it sends those messages, if it…\\nStep 1. …discovers no other HSRP routers in the subnet, the local router becomes the \\nactive router.\\nStep 2. …discovers an existing HSRP router, and both are currently negotiating to \\ndecide which should become the HSRP active router, the routers negotiate, \\nwith the router with the highest HSRP priority becoming the HSRP active \\nrouter.\\nStep 3. …discovers an existing HSRP router in the subnet, and that router is already \\nacting as the active router:\\nA. If configured with no preemption (the default; no standby preempt), \\nthe local router becomes a standby router, even if it has a better (higher) \\npriority.\\nB. If configured with preemption (standby preempt), the local router \\nchecks its priority versus the active router; if the local router priority is \\nbetter (higher), the local router takes over (preempts) the existing active \\nrouter to become the new active HSRP router. \\nptg17396363Key Topics  185\\nBeyond IPv6 support and shorter Hello timer options, other differences for version 2 versus \\nversion 1 include a different virtual MAC address base value and a different multicast IP \\naddress used as the destination for all messages.

No Yes\\nptg17396363186  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNext, for HSRP to work correctly, some of the HSRP parameters must match. For instance, \\nif two routers were intended to be in the same HSRP group, but were configured with two \\ndifferent HSRP versions, they would not understand each other’s messages, and would \\nignore each other, and would act independently from each other. The following list details \\nsome important items to check to make sure the configurations should work:\\n■Routers must be configured with the same HSRP version (standby version {1 | 2})\\n■Routers must be configured with the same HSRP group number (standby number … ).\\n■Routers must configure the same virtual IP address (standby number ip address).\\n■Virtual IP address must be (a) in the same subnet as the interface IP address and (b) not\\nused by any other device in the subnet (including the other HSRP routers) ( standby\\nnumber ip address).\\n■In the attached Layer 2 network, the interfaces on the routers or Layer 3 switches must\\nbe in the same VLAN.\\n■No ACLs should filter HSRP messages between the two routers. (HSRP uses UDP,\\nport 1985; version 1 sends to multicast address 224.0.0.2, while version 2 sends to\\n224.0.0.102.)\\nptg17396363Key Topics  187\\nIOS cannot detect several configuration mistakes that vary from the good configuration \\nsuggestions in the previous list.

However, \\nwhen more than one route matches a packet’s destination address, the router uses the “best” \\nroute, defined as follows:\\nWhen a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a router’s IPv4 \\nrouting table, the router uses the most specific route—in other words, the route with the \\nlongest prefix length mask.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  193\\nFigure 21-10 shows the output of a sample show ip route command.

Instead, a built-in protocol, \\nNDP, lets the host ask the local routers to identify themselves. Otherwise, hosts use the \\nsame general process as with DHCPv4.

First, the process takes advantage of NDP, through \\nwhich the host can learn the following from any router on the link: the IPv6 prefix (subnet \\nID), the prefix length (mask equivalent), and the default router IPv6 address. The host uses \\nSLAAC rules to build the rest of its address. Finally, the host uses stateless DHCPv6 to learn the DNS server IPv6 addresses.

Split the 6-byte (12 hex digits) MAC address in two halves (6 hex digits each).\\n2. Insert FFFE in between the two, making the interface ID now have a total of 16 hex\\ndigits (64 bits).\\n3.

So, a few \\nconcepts similar to that chapter, the following must be true for an IPv6 host to successfully \\nuse either stateful or stateless DHCPv6 to learn information from a DHCPv6 server:\\n1. The server must be in the same subnet as the client.\\nOr\\n2. The server may be in a different subnet, with\\na. The router that sits on the same subnet as the client host correctly implementing\\nDHCP relay\\nb.  IPv6 connectivity working between that local router (the router near the client\\nhost) and the DHCPv6 server\\nptg17396363Key Topics  207\\nThe two most likely root causes of a host failing to dynamically learn its IPv6 settings with \\nstateful DHCPv6 are root causes 2A and 2B. For 2A, the solution requires a configuration \\ncommand on the correct interface on each LAN that is remote from the DHCPv6 server. \\nFor instance, in Figure 22-16, host D sits on a LAN subnet on the left, with R1’s G0/0 inter-\\nface connected to the same subnet. R1 should have the command listed at the bottom of the figure to enable the IPv6 DHCP relay function pointing to the DHCPv6 server on the right.\\nB D\\nDHCPv6 Server\\nipv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:DB8:1111:3::8G0/0 R1R2\\nS1\\n2001:DB8:1111:3::8\\nFigure 22-16 IPv6 DHCP Relay\\nptg17396363208  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nHosts that use SLAAC rely on the information in the RA message. So, when a host fails to \\nlearn and build these three settings when using SLAAC, including the IPv6 address, the next \\nquestion really should be this: What could cause the NDP RS/RA process to fail? The fol-\\nlowing list details these potential root causes:\\n1. No LAN connectivity between the host and any router in the subnet.\\n2. The router is missing an ipv6 address interface subcommand.\\n3. The router is missing an ipv6 unicast-routing global configuration command.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  209\\nRouting problems happen for many reasons. Some routing problems happen because routes \\nare missing from a router (perhaps because of many specific root causes). Some routing \\nproblems happen because a router has an incorrect route. The following list gives just some \\nof the reasons why a router might be missing a needed route or might have an incorrect \\nroute:\\n■Links between routers are down.\\n■Routing protocol neighbor problems exist.\\n■Routing protocol route filtering prevents the route from being added to the IPv6 routing\\ntable.\\n■Incorrect static routes send packets to the wrong next router.\\n■Poor subnet design duplicates subnets in different locations in the network, falsely\\nadvertising a subnet.\\nptg17396363210  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 23\\nTo the depth that this book discusses OSPF theory and concepts, OSPFv3 acts very much \\nlike OSPFv2. For example, both use link-state logic. Both use the same metric. And the list keeps getting longer, because the protocols do have many similarities. The following list \\nnotes many of the similarities for the features discussed both in this chapter and in Chapter \\n7, “Understanding OSPF Concepts”:\\n■Both are link-state protocols.\\n■Both use the same area design concepts and design terms.\\n■Both require that the routing protocol be enabled on an interface.\\n■Once enabled on an interface, both then attempt to discover neighbors connected to the\\ndata link connected to an interface.\\n■Both perform a check of certain settings before a router will become neighbors with\\nanother router (the list of checks is slightly different between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3).\\n■After two routers become neighbors, both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 proceed by exchanging\\nthe contents of their LSDB—the link-state advertisements (LSA) that describe the net-\\nwork topology—between the two neighbors.\\n■After all the LSAs have been exchanged, both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 use the shortest path\\nfirst (SPF) algorithm to calculate the best route to each subnet.\\n■Both use the same metric concept, based on the interface cost of each interface, with the\\nsame default cost values.\\n■Both use LSAs to describe the topology, with some differences in how LSAs work.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  211\\nTo be clear, nothing in R1’s configuration mentions multiarea or ABR—R1 simply acts as an \\nABR because its configuration puts some interfaces in area 0 and others in other nonback-bone areas.

Set the cost explicitly using the ipv6 ospf cost x interface subcommand to a value\\nbetween 1 and 65,535, inclusive.\\n2. Change the interface bandwidth with the bandwidth speed command, with speed\\nbeing a number in kilobits per second (Kbps), and let the router calculate the value\\nbased on the OSPFv3 reference-bandwidth / interface-bandwidth.\\n3. Change the reference bandwidth with router OSPFv3 subcommand auto-cost\\nreference-bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits per second (Mbps).\\nptg17396363Key Topics  213\\nTo the depth discussed in these books, OSPFv3 works much like OSPFv2 with regard to\\n■Area design and the related terms\\n■The configuration idea of enabling the routing process, per interface, for an area\\n■The neighbor discovery process with Hello messages\\n■Transitioning through neighbor states and the topology exchange process\\n■The use of full and 2-way as the normal stable state for working neighbor relationships,\\nwith other states being either temporary or pointing to some problem with the neighbor\\n■SPF and how it uses interface cost to calculate metrics\\n■Messages being sent to reserved multicast addresses (FF02::5 for all OSPF routers,\\nFF02::6 for all DR and BDR routers), similar to OSPFv2’s use of 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6\\nptg17396363214  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSo, what is different between OSPFv3 and OSPFv2? The next list mentions a few differ-\\nences. However, note that many of the differences happen to be outside the scope of the \\ncoverage of topics in this book.\\n■OSPFv3 neighbors do not have to have IPv6 addresses in the same IPv6 subnet, whereas\\nOSPFv2 neighbors must be in the same IPv4 subnet.\\n■They use different names for their Type 3 LSAs (called inter-area prefix LSAs in OSPFv3\\nand summary LSAs in OSPFv2).\\n■OSPFv3 introduces new LSA types not used by OSPFv2 (beyond scope of this book).\\n■The details defined inside LSA Types 1, 2, and 3 differ (beyond scope of this book).\\nptg17396363Key Topics  215\\nMost troubleshooting discussions with OSPFv3 revolve around the problems that can occur \\nbetween two OSPFv3 neighbors. However, mistakes with interface subcommands can actu-\\nally cause many of these OSPF neighbor problems. To get the discussions started, just con-\\nsider the problems that can occur with the interface subcommands mentioned so far in this \\nchapter:\\n■Configuring the wrong area with the ipv6 ospf process-id area area-id interface sub-\\ncommand prevents neighbor relationships off that interface.\\n■Making an interface passive to the OSPFv3 process prevents the local router from form-\\ning neighbor relationships off that interface.\\nptg17396363216  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTroubleshooting OSPF neighbor relationships requires that you remember many details \\nabout items that could prevent two routers from becoming neighbors at all. Thankfully, \\nOSPFv3 uses the same list as OSPFv2, with one noticeable difference: OSPFv3 does not \\nrequire the neighbors to be in the same subnet. Table 23-2 lists the items to consider when \\ntroubleshooting OSPF neighbor relationships.\\nTable 23-2 Neighbor Requirements for OSPFv2 and OSPFv3\\nRequirement OSPFv2 OSPFv3\\nInterfaces must be in an up/up state.

Check the routers with interfaces directly connected to that IPv6 prefix. A \\nrouter must have OSPFv3 enabled on that interface before OSPFv3 will adver-\\ntise about the subnet.\\nStep 2. Check OSPFv3 neighbor relationships for all routers between the local router \\nand the routers with an interface connected to IPv6 prefix X.\\nFor instance, in Figure 23-11, if Router R3 did not have an ipv6 ospf process-id area \\narea-id command on its LAN interface, all seven routers could have working neighbor \\nrelationships, but R3 still would not advertise about subnet 33.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  219\\nIf a router has a route, but it appears to be the wrong (suboptimal) route, take these steps:\\nStep 1. Check for broken neighbor relationships over what should be the optimal path \\nfrom the local router and prefix Y.\\nStep 2. Check the OSPFv3 cost settings on the interfaces in the optimal path.\\nFor instance, in Figure 23-11, suppose that R1 indeed has one route for subnet 33, pointing \\nover the lower route, with R4 as the next-hop router. The root cause of that choice could \\nbe the following:\\n■The R2-R3 neighbor relationship is not working.\\n■The sum of the costs for the top route is larger (worse) than the sum of the costs for the\\nlower route. (Note that the figure shows an asterisk beside each interface whose cost is\\npart of the calculation.)\\nptg17396363220  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 24\\nThe rest of the EIGRP for IPv6 configuration commands work either exactly like the EIGRP \\nfor IPv4 commands or very similarly to them. To show the similarities, Table 24-2 lists the EIGRP for IPv4 configuration options introduced in Chapter 10, “Implementing EIGRP for \\nIPv4,” making comparisons to the similar configuration options in EIGRP for IPv6.\\nTable 24-2 Comparison of EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6 Configuration Commands\\nFunction EIGRP for IPv4 EIGRP for IPv6\\nCreate process, define ASN router eigrp as-number ipv6 router eigrp as-number\\nDefine router ID explicitly \\n(router mode)eigrp router-id number Identical\\nChange number of concurrent routes (router \\nmode)maximum-paths number Identical\\nSet the variance multiplier (router mode)variance multiplier Identical\\nInfluence metric calculation \\n(interface mode)bandwidth value\\ndelay valueIdentical\\nChange Hello and hold \\ntimers (interface mode)ip hello-interval eigrp asn time ip hold-t ime eigrp asn timeChange ip to ipv6\\nEnable EIGRP on an interface network ip-address [wildcard-\\nmask]ipv6 eigrp as-number \\n(interface subcommand)\\nDisable and enable automatic summarization (router mode)[no] auto-summary Not needed for EIGRP for IPv6\\nptg17396363Key Topics  221\\nSo many similarities exist between EIGRP for IPv6 and EIGRP for IPv4 that you should just \\nassume that they work the same, except for a few differences, as noted in the following list:\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 advertises IPv6 prefixes, whereas EIGRP for IPv4 advertises IPv4 sub-\\nnets.\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 show commands use a keyword of ipv6, in the same position where\\nEIGRP show commands use a keyword of ip.\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 uses the same checklist for choosing whether to become neighbors,\\nexcept EIGRP for IPv6 routers may become neighbors if they have IPv6 addresses in dif-\\nferent subnets. (EIGRP for IPv4 neighbors must be in the same IPv4 subnet.)\\n■EIGRP for IPv6 does not have an autosummary concept (while EIGRP for IPv4 does).\\nptg17396363222  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNext, focus for a moment on troubleshooting related to EIGRP for IPv6 interfaces. As with \\nOSPF, most troubleshooting revolves around the neighbor relationships. However, this \\nshort list describes two problems that can happen related to the interfaces:\\n■The omission of an ipv6 eigrp asn interface subcommand on an interface that has no\\npossible neighbors may go overlooked. This omission does not impact EIGRP for IPv6\\nneighbors. However, this omission means that EIGRP for IPv6 is not enabled on that\\ninterface, and therefore the router will not advertise about that connected subnet. This\\nproblem shows up as a missing route.\\n■Making an interface passive to the EIGRP for IPv6 process, when a potential EIGRP for\\nIPv6 neighbor is connected to that link, prevents the two routers from becoming neigh-\\nbors. Note that the neighbor relationship fails with just one of the two routers having a\\npassive interface.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  223\\nTable 24-3 lists the items to consider when troubleshooting EIGRP neighbor relationships.\\nTable 24-3 Neighbor Requirements for EIGRP for IPv4 and EIGRP for IPv6\\nRequirement EIGRP for \\nIPv4EIGRP \\nfor IPv6\\nInterfaces must be in an up/up state.

Thinking through a potential EIGRP for IPv6 problem actu-\\nally follows the same logic as working through an OSPFv3 problem. Repeating some of the \\nlogic from the preceding chapter, when a router simply has no route to a given subnet—for \\ninstance, if R1 had no route at all for subnet 33—then do the following:\\nStep 1. Check the routers with interfaces directly connected to that IPv6 prefix. A \\nrouter must have EIGRP for IPv6 enabled on that interface before EIGRP for \\nIPv6 will advertise about the subnet.\\nStep 2. Check EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor relationships for all routers between the local \\nrouter and the routers with an interface connected to IPv6 prefix X.\\nFor instance, in Figure 24-2, if Router R4 did not have an ipv6 eigrp 1 command under its \\nG0/0 interface, all the routers would have their correct EIGRP for IPv6 neighbor relation-\\nships, but R4 would not advertise about subnet 33.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  225\\nIf a router has a route but it appears to be the wrong (suboptimal) route, take these steps:\\nStep 1. Check for broken neighbor relationships over what should be the optimal path \\nfrom the local router and prefix Y.\\nStep 2. Check the interface bandwidth and delay settings. Pay particular attention \\nto the lowest bandwidth in the end-to-end route, because EIGRP ignores the \\nfaster bandwidths, using only the lowest (slowest) bandwidth in its metric \\ncalculation.\\nptg17396363226  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 25\\nAt this point you should be familiar with IPv4 ACLs but just starting to learn about IPv6 \\nACLs. As you learn about IPv6, you will notice subtle differences about IPv6 that have direct functional relationships with IPv4 protocol operations. Similarly, there are subtle sim-\\nilarities and differences between the way that IPv4 ACLs and IPv6 ACLs operate. Following \\nare the ways that IPv4 and IPv6 are similar:\\n■Both match on the source address or the destination address in the protocol header.\\n■Both match individual host addresses or subnets/prefixes.\\n■Both can be applied directionally (inbound and outbound) to a router’s interface.\\n■Both can match on transport layer protocol information such as TCP or UDP source or\\ndestination port numbers.\\n■Both can match on specific ICMP message types and codes.\\n■Both have an implicit deny statement at the end of the ACL that matches all remaining\\npackets.\\n■Both support time ranges for time-based ACLs.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  227\\nOf course, there are key differences between IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs as well. IPv4 ACLs match \\nIPv4 packets only (and not IPv6), and match special fields found only in IPv4 headers. \\nLikewise, IPv6 ACLs match against IPv6 address fields as well as other fields unique to an \\nIPv6 header. The following is a summary of the key differences:\\n■IPv4 ACLs can only match IPv4 packets and IPv6 ACLs can only match IPv6 packets.\\n■IPv4 ACLs can be identified by number or name, while IPv6 ACLs use names only.\\n■IPv4 ACLs identify that an ACL is either standard or extended based on the ACL num-\\nber range or by using the standard or extended keyword. IPv6 ACLs have a similar\\nstandard and extended ACL concept, but do not differentiate the styles with a different\\nconfiguration keyword.\\n■IPv4 ACLs can match on specific values unique to an IPv4 header (e.g., option, prece-\\ndence, ToS TTL, fragments).\\n■IPv6 ACLs can match on specific values unique to an IPv6 header (e.g., flow label, DSCP)\\nas well as extension and option header values.\\n■IPv6 ACLs have some implicit permit statements at the end of each ACL, just before the\\nimplicit deny all at the end of the ACL, while IPv4 ACLs do not have implicit permit\\nstatements.\\nptg17396363228  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFollowing is the syntax for standard IPv6 ACL permit and deny statements. IPv6 supports \\nboth standard and extended ACLs, although the configuration does not identify an ACL \\nas one or the other. IPv6 standard ACLs can match the source and destination IPv6 address \\nfields, but no other parts of an IPv6 packet.\\n[permit | deny] ipv6 {source-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host source-ipv6-\\naddress} {destination-ipv6-prefix/prefix-length | any | host destination-ipv6-\\naddress} [log]\\nptg17396363Key Topics  229\\nFigure 25-2 points out some of the more common matching options specific to IPv6 \\nextended ACL permit and deny commands when using the tcp, udp, and icmp keywords. \\nWhen using any protocol keyword other than ipv6, the permit or deny command then \\nmatches a subset of IPv6 packets. For instance, using the tcp keyword as the protocol \\nmatches all IPv6 packets with a TCP header. Additionally, as with IPv4 ACLs, to match TCP \\nport numbers, you must use the tcp keyword in the permit or deny command. Likewise, the command must use the udp keyword to match UDP port numbers, and the icmp keyword \\nto then match ICMP message types.\\n[icmp-type [icmp-code] | icmp-message]  [eq | gt | lt | neq {port | protocol}] [range {port | protocol}]    \\n [eq | gt | lt | neq {port | protocol}] [range {port | protocol}]Port Matching\\nPort Matching\\nICMP Message Typespermit tcp...\\npermit udp...\\npermit icmp...Command\\nCommand\\nCommand\\nFigure 25-2 ICMP, TCP, and UDP Matching Fields in Extended IPv6 ACLs\\nptg17396363230  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIn this section, practice getting comfortable with the syntax of the ipv6 access-list permit \\nor deny ACL entry, particularly with choosing the correct matching logic. First, the follow-\\ning list summarizes some important tips to consider when choosing matching parameters to \\nany ipv6 access-list permit or deny ACL entries:\\n■To match a specific address, just list the address after the host keyword.\\n■To match any and all addresses, use the any keyword.\\n■To match based only on the IPv6 prefix, use the “slash” notation to designate the num-\\nber of bits in the prefix length. For example, a /64 prefix length matches the first 64 bits\\nof the 128-bit IPv6 address, and any Interface Identifier (IID) within the least-significant\\n64 bits of that address falls within that prefix range.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  231\\nFor this very reason, Cisco IOS IPv6 ACLs have three implicit rules at the bottom of each \\nACL. These are invisible, but they are included at the end of each IPv6 ACL so as to implic-\\nitly permit NA and NS messages. The final implicit IPv6 ACL statement is the default deny \\nthat is commonly expected. The three implicit IPv6 ACL rules at the bottom of every ACL \\nare shown in Example 25-13.\\nExample 25-13 Implicit IPv6 ACL Entries\\npermit icmp any any nd-na\\npermit icmp any any nd-ns\\ndeny ipv6 any any\\nptg17396363232  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 26\\nSpecifically, the NMS uses the SNMP Get, GetNext, and GetBulk messages (together ref-\\nerenced simply as Get messages) to ask for information from an agent. The NMS sends an SNMP Set message to write variables on the SNMP agent as a means to change the configu-\\nration of the device. These messages come in pairs, with, for instance, a Get Request asking \\nthe agent for the contents of a variable, and the Get Response supplying that information. Figure 26-2 shows an example of a typical flow, with the NMS using an SNMP Get to ask for the MIB variable that describes the status of a particular router interface.\\nSNMP Get Request\\nRouter 1Gi0/0The MIBI want to check the MIB variable \\nto find out if Gi0/0 is UP/UP\\nSNMP Get Response21\\nFigure 26-2 SNMP Get Request and Get Response Message Flow\\nptg17396363Key Topics  233\\nAs an example of a Trap, suppose that Router 1’s G0/0 interface fails, as shown at Step 1 of \\nFigure 26-3. With Traps configured, the router would send an SNMP Trap message to the \\nNMS, with that Trap message noting the down state of the G0/0 interface. Then, the NMS \\nsoftware can send a text message to the network support staff, pop up a window on the \\nNMS screen, change to red the color of the correct router icon on the graphical interface, and so on.\\nSNMP Trap\\nRouter 1The MIBMy Gi0/0 Interface Failed!\\nTake a Look!Send text, Turn Red, Etc.\\n3\\n2\\n1Gi0/0\\nFigure 26-3 SNMP Trap Notification Process\\nptg17396363234  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nSNMPv1 defines both a read-only community and a read-write community. The read-only \\n(RO) community allows Get messages, and the read-write (RW) community allows both \\nreads and writes (Gets and Sets). Figure 26-5 shows the concepts. At Steps 1 and 2, the agent \\nis configured with particular RO and RW community strings and the NMS configures the matching values. At Step 3, the SNMP Get can flow with either community, but at Step 4, the Set Request must use the RW community. \\nR1 RO Pass1\\nR1 RW Pass2R1 RO Pass1R1 RW Pass2NMS\\nGet (Pass1 or Pass2 Works)\\nR1 Set (Pass2 Only Works)\\n2 13\\n4\\nFigure 26-5 RO and RW Communities with the Get and Set Commands\\nptg17396363Key Topics  235\\nSNMPv3 arrived with much celebration among network administrators. Finally, security had \\narrived with the powerful network management protocol. SNMPv3 does away with commu-\\nnities, and replaces them with the following features: \\n■Message integrity: This mechanism, applied to all SNMPv3 messages, confirms whether\\nor not each message has been changed during transit.\\n■Authentication: An optional feature that adds authentication with both a username andpassword, with the password never sent as clear text. Instead, it uses a hashing method\\nlike many other modern authentication processes.\\n■Encryption (privacy): An optional feature that encrypts the contents of SNMPv3 mes-\\nsages, so that attackers who intercept the messages cannot read their contents.\\nptg17396363236  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFigure 26-7 shows the entire snmp-server group command. The required parameters on the \\nleft include a name that the network engineer can make up; it only needs to match other \\ncommands on the local router.

As you can see from the summary in Table 26-2, all three security \\nlevels provide message integrity for their messages, which confirms that the message has not \\nbeen changed in transit. The auth option adds authentication to message integrity, using a \\nusername and password, with IOS storing the password with a hash and never sending the password as clear text. The last increase in security level, configured by using the priv secu-\\nrity level, causes the SNMP manager and agent to encrypt the entire SNMP packet for all \\nSNMP messages sent, in addition to performing message integrity and authentication.\\nTable 26-2 SNMPv3 Security Levels Keywords and Their Meanings\\nCommand \\nKeywordKeyword in MessagesChecks Message Integrity?

This operation generates an ICMP Echo Request message, so any host that will respond to a normal ICMP Echo Request (a normal ping) will reply back with an ICMP Echo Reply. Using the IP SLA ICMP Echo probe means that you can monitor the state of \\nand performance sending packets to any IP address in the network, including servers and \\nuser hosts, as shown in Figure 26-12. Steps 1 and 2 show Router R1 as an IP SLA source, with R4 replying to the normal ICMP packet. Steps 3 and 4 show the same idea, again with Router R1 as the IP SLA source, with the server replying to the ICMP Echo message.\\nICMP Echo Request\\nICMP Echo Response\\nICMP Echo Request\\nICMP Echo ResponseR1 R41\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nFigure 26-12 Using IP SLA ICMP Echo Probes to Routers and Normal Hosts\\nptg17396363Key Topics  241\\nThe show ip sla statistics 1 command provides some basic history through a counter of \\nsuccesses and failures, as shown in Example 26-14. In addition to the return code and RTT \\nof the most recent operation, you get a counter of successes and failures of past operations. \\nSo, you can get a sense of whether the pings have been failing or not. \\nExample 26-14 Historical Success/Failure Counters with IP SLA\\nR1# show ip sla statistics 1\\nIPSLAs Latest Operation Statistics\\nIPSLA operation id: 1\\nLatest RTT: 16 milliseconds\\nLatest operation start time: 12:40:39 EST Tue Jan 5 2016\\nLatest operation return code: OK\\nNumber of successes: 7\\nNumber of failures: 0\\nOperation time to live: Forever\\nptg17396363242  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nWith traditional IP SLA history, SLA takes the RTT and return code information and stores \\nit in a history bucket. The show ip sla history command then displays one line per bucket. You can think of it as the same information in the show ip sla summary command seen \\nback in Example 26-13, but going backward in time for the number of history buckets defined. Earlier Example 26-12 shows IP SLA operation 1 uses six buckets, so the output in Example 26-15 shows the results of the most recent six IP SLA operations for operation number 1.\\nExample 26-15 Displaying the Traditional Historical State of an IP SLA ICMP Echo \\nProbe\\nR1# show ip sla history 1\\nPoint by point History\\nEntry    = Entry number\\nLifeI    = Life index\\nBucketI  = Bucket index\\nSampleI  = Sample index\\nSampleT  = Sample start time (milliseconds)\\nCompT    = RTT (milliseconds)\\nSense    = Response return code\\nEntry LifeI BucketI    SampleI    SampleT    CompT Sense TargetAddr\\n1     1 11 1 59438868   108 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 12 1 59498868   188 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 13 1 59558868   280 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 14 1 59618868   88 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 15 1 59678868   160 1 10.1.3.2\\n1     1 16 1 59738868   252 1 10.1.3.2\\nptg17396363Key Topics  243\\nSPAN solves this problem by copying those frames from certain ports (SPAN source \\nports) to the port where the network analyzer sits (the SPAN destination port). Figure \\n26-16 shows the concept. In this case, the switch has two SPAN source ports, G1/0/11 and G1/0/12. Frames received on both ports are copied out to the SPAN destination port G1/0/21. \\nLayer 2 Switch\\nUnicast Frames\\nNetwork\\nAnalyzerG 1/0/11\\nG 1/0/21G 1/0/12Unicast Frames\\nSPAN SPAN \\nFigure 26-16 SPAN Copies (Mirrors) Frames to the Network Analyzer\\nptg17396363244  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nFirst, consider the SPAN example in Figure 26-17. It shows the concept of using port \\nG1/0/11 as a source port. However, the logic goes beyond identifying the source port; it \\nalso specifies for the switch to copy frames being transmitted (Tx) out that switch port.

That is, the switch does not learn MAC addresses for received frames, or\\nsend frames based on matching the MAC table, for that port.\\n■A SPAN destination port can be unconfigured from one monitor session (no monitor\\nsession number destination interface type number) and then added to another monitor\\nsession.\\n■Multiple SPAN sources can be used in a single SPAN session.\\n■One SPAN session cannot mix interfaces and VLAN sources; that is, the sources must all\\nbe interfaces or all be VLANs.\\n■One SPAN session can use any combination of directions (transmit, receive, and both) as\\napplied to different SPAN sources.\\n■EtherChannel interfaces can be used as source ports. Frames for all ports in the\\nEtherChannel will be considered by SPAN.\\n■Trunks can be used as source ports. When used, by default, SPAN includes frames from\\nall VLANs on that trunk, but SPAN VLAN filtering can limit the VLANs included.\\nptg17396363246  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nChapter 27\\nA VM—that is, an OS instance that is decoupled from the server hardware—still must \\nexecute on hardware. Each VM has configuration as to the minimum number of vCPUs it needs, minimum RAM, and so on. The virtualization system then starts each VM on some \\nphysical server so that enough physical server hardware capacity exists to support all the \\nVMs running on that host. So, at any one point in time, each VM is running on a physi-cal server, using a subset of the CPU, RAM, storage, and NICs on that server. Figure 27-3 shows a graphic of that concept, with four separate VMs running on one physical server.\\nApp\\nOS OS OS OS\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkHypervisorApp AppVirtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine Virtual Machine\\nApp App App App App App App App App\\nFigure 27-3 Four VMs Running on One Host; Hypervisor Manages the Hardware\\nptg17396363Key Topics  247\\nTo get a broader sense of what it means for a service to be a cloud service, examine this \\nlist of five criteria for a cloud computing service. The list is derived from the definition of \\ncloud computing as put forth by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology \\n(NIST):\\nOn-demand self-service: The IT consumer chooses when to start and stop using the ser-\\nvice, without any direct interaction with the provider of the service. \\nBroad network access: The service must be available from many types of devices and \\nover many types of networks (including the Internet). \\nResource pooling: The provider creates a pool of resources (rather than dedicating spe-\\ncific servers for use only by certain consumers), and dynamically allocates resources from \\nthat pool for each new request from a consumer. \\nRapid elasticity: To the consumer, the resource pool appears to be unlimited (that is, it \\nexpands quickly, so it is called elastic), and the requests for new service are filled quickly.  \\nMeasured service: The provider can measure the usage and report that usage to the con-\\nsumer, both for transparency and for billing. \\nptg17396363248  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nIaaS offers a similar idea, but the consumer receives the use of a VM. You specify the \\namount of hardware performance/capacity to allocate to the VM (number of virtual CPUs, amount of RAM, and so on) as shown in Figure 27-9. You can even pick an OS to use. Once \\nselected, the cloud provider starts the VM, which boots the chosen OS. \\nNOTE In the virtualization and cloud world, starting a VM is often called spinning up a \\nVM or instantiating a VM.\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating System (Optional) User Picks\\nUser PicksCustomer Installs Apps Later\\n12\\n1\\nFigure 27-9 IaaS Concept\\nptg17396363Key Topics  249\\nWith Software as a Service (SaaS), the consumer receives a service with working software. \\nThe cloud provider may use VMs, possibly many VMs, to create the service, but those are \\nhidden from the consumer. The cloud provider licenses, installs, and supports whatever \\nsoftware is required. The cloud provider then monitors performance of the application. \\nHowever, the consumer chooses to use the application, signs up for the service, and starts using the application—no further installation work required.

Without experience as a developer, it \\ncan be difficult to tell whether one PaaS service might be better. You can still make some \\nchoices about sizing the PaaS VMs, similar to IaaS tools when setting up some PaaS services, \\nas shown in Figure 27-12, but the developer tools included are the key to a PaaS service.\\nStorage CPU RAM NetworkOperating SystemDevelopment Environment and Tools (Platform)Primary\\nFactor\\nFigure 27-12 PaaS Concept\\nptg17396363Key Topics  251\\nUsing the Internet as the WAN connectivity to a public cloud is both a blessing and a curse \\nin some ways. Using the Internet can help you get started with public cloud, and to get \\nworking quickly, but it also means that you do not have to do any planning before deploy-\\ning a public cloud service. With a little planning, a network engineer can see some of the \\nnegatives of using the Internet—the same negatives when using the Internet for other pur-poses—which then might make you want to use alternative WAN connections. Those nega-tives for using the Internet for public cloud access are\\nSecurity: The Internet is less secure than private WAN connections in that a “man in the \\nmiddle” can attempt to read the contents of data that passes to/from the public cloud.\\nCapacity: Moving an internal application to the public cloud increases network traffic, \\nso the question of whether the enterprise’s Internet links can handle the additional load needs to be considered.\\nQuality of Service (QoS): The Internet does not provide QoS, whereas private WANs \\ncan. Using the Internet may result in a worse user experience than desired, because of \\nhigher delay (latency), jitter, and packet loss.  \\nNo WAN SLA: ISPs typically will not provide a service level agreement (SLA) for WAN \\nperformance and availability to all destinations of a network. WAN service providers are \\nmuch more likely to offer performance and availability SLAs.  \\nptg17396363252  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTable 27-2 summarizes some of these key pros and cons for the public WAN options for \\ncloud computing, for study and reference.\\nTable 27-2 Comparison of Key Pros and Cons\\nInternet Internet \\nVPNMPLS \\nVPNEthernet WANIntercloud Exchange\\nSecure No Y es Y es Y es Y es\\nQoS No No Yes Yes Yes\\nRequires capacity planning Y es Y es Y es Y es Y es\\nEasier migration to new provider Yes Yes No No YesCan begin using public cloud \\nquicklyYes Yes No No No\\nptg17396363Key Topics  253\\nGiven those steps, the enterprise can choose to do something simple: just update its own \\nDNS to refer to the public IP address used by its application as running at the public cloud \\nprovider.

Of course, the forwarding decision is part of the logic; in fact, the data plane is often called the forwarding plane. But \\nthink beyond matching the destination address to a table. For perspective, the following list details some of the more common actions that a networking device does that fit into the data plane:\\n■De-encapsulating and re-encapsulating a packet in a data link frame (routers, Layer 3\\nswitches)\\n■Adding or removing an 802.1Q trunking header (routers and switches)\\n■Matching the destination MAC address to the MAC address table (Layer 2 switches)\\n■Matching the destination IP address to the IP routing table (routers, Layer 3 switches)\\n■Encrypting the data and adding a new IP header (for VPN processing)\\n■Changing the source or destination IP address (for NAT processing)\\n■Discarding a message due to a filter (ACLs, port security)\\nptg17396363Key Topics  255\\nThe following list includes many of the more common control plane protocols:\\n■Routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP)\\n■IPv4 ARP\\n■IPv6 NDP\\n■Switch MAC learning\\n■STP\\nptg17396363256  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nNote that a switch still has a general-purpose CPU and RAM as well, as shown in Figure \\n28-4.

First, the con-\\ntroller sits anywhere in the network that has IP reachability to the devices in the network. \\nEach of the network devices still has a data plane. However, note that none of the devices \\nhas a control plane. In the variation of SDN as shown in Figure 28-5, the controller (or a program making use of the controller) directly programs the data plane entries into each device’s tables. The networking devices do not populate their forwarding tables with tradi-\\ntional distributed control plane processes.\\nData PlaneController\\nSouthbound\\nInterface (SBI)\\nNetwork Device Network Device Network DevicepacketpacketControl\\nPlane\\nData Plane Data PlaneControl\\nPlaneControl\\nPlane\\npacket packet\\nFigure 28-5 Centralized Control Plane and a Distributed Data Plane\\nptg17396363258  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nA controller does much of the work needed for the control plane in a centralized control \\nmodel. It gathers all sorts of useful information about the network, like the items in the pre-\\nvious list. The controller itself can create a centralized repository of all this useful informa-\\ntion about the network.\\nA controller’s Northbound Interface (NBI) opens the controller so its data and functions can \\nbe used by other programs, enabling network programmability, with much quicker develop-\\nment. Programs can pull information from the controller, using the controller’s APIs. The \\nNBIs also enable programs to use the controller’s abilities to program flows into the devices using the controller’s SBIs.\\nptg17396363Key Topics  259\\nFigure 28-7 shows the big ideas with a REST API. The application runs on a host at the \\ntop of the figure. In this case, at Step 1, it sends an HTTP GET request to a particular URI. \\nThe HTTP GET is like any other HTTP GET, even like those used to retrieve web pages. \\nHowever, the URI is not for a web page, but rather identifies an object on the controller, \\ntypically a data structure that the application needs to learn and then process. For example, the URI might identify an object that is the list of physical interfaces on a specific device along with the status of each.\\nController APIAPP\\nVariables\\nHTTP GET Response:\\nJSON dataHTTP GET URI1 23\\nFigure 28-7 Process Example of a GET Using a REST API\\nptg17396363260  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nTo make it all work, ACI uses a centralized controller called the Application Policy \\nInfrastructure Controller (APIC), as shown in Figure 28-9. The name defines the function \\nin this case: It is the controller that creates application policies for the data center infra-structure. The APIC, of course, has a convenient GUI, but the power comes in software control—that is, network programmability. The same virtualization software, or cloud or automation software, even scripts written by the network engineer, can define the endpoint \\ngroups, policies, and so on to the APIC. But all these players access the ACI system by \\ninterfacing to the APIC; the network engineer no longer needs to connect to each individual switch and configure CLI commands.\\nVirtualization\\nSoftware\\nCloud\\nSoftware\\nAutomationSoftwareAPIC\\nControllerACI DC with \\nNexus 9000 Switches\\nGUI orScriptsOpFlex\\nSome Control Plane\\nin Switches\\nFigure 28-9 Controlling the ACI Data Center Network Using the APIC\\nptg17396363Key Topics  261\\nFigure 28-10 shows a general view of the APIC-EM controller architecture, with a few of \\nthe APIC-EM apps, the REST API, and a list of the SBIs.\\nTopology\\nVisualizationREST API iWAN Plug n\\nPlayPath\\nTrace\\nCore Features\\nCLI (Telnet, SSH), SNMPYour App\\nAny Topology\\nMany Device ModelsCoreNBI\\nSBIController\\nApps from Cisco\\nFigure 28-10 APIC-EM Controller Model\\nptg17396363262  CCNA Routing and Switching ICND2 200-105 Official Cert Guide\\nThe three example SDN branches in this section of the book were chosen to provide a \\nwide variety for the sake of learning.

However, they differ to some degree in how much of the control plane work is \\ncentralized.
