The apps run natively on the controller; that is, they do not run elsewhere in the network but are installed as part of the controller. From a user interface perspective, they appear as just another feature in the user interface, but architecturally, the apps are separate from the base controller, and may even be developed by different groups within Cisco.\n",

As for licensing, some apps, called basic apps, do not require a license—they are free to use (just like APIC-EM itself). Other apps, called   solution apps, require the purchase of a license for legal use of the app.\n",

            "The chapter begins with three security topics. The first section addresses IEEE 802.1x, \n",
            "which defines a mechanism to secure user access to a LAN by requiring the user to supply a username and password before a switch allows the device’s sent frames into the LAN. This tool helps secure the network against attackers gaining access to the network. The second section, “AAA Authentication,” discusses network device security, protecting router and switch CLI access by requiring username/password login with an external authentication server. The third section, “DHCP Snooping,” explores how switches can prevent security attacks that take advantage of DHCP messages and functions. By watching DHCP messages, noticing when they are used in abnormal ways not normally done with DHCP, DHCP can prevent attacks by simply filtering certain DHCP messages.\n",
            "The final of the four major sections in this chapter looks at two similar design tools that \n",
            "make multiple switches act like one switch: switch stacking and chassis aggregation. Switch stacking allows a set of similar switches that sit near to each other (in the same wiring closet, typically in the same part of the same rack) to be cabled together and then act like a single switch. Using a switch stack greatly reduces the amount of work to manage the switch, and it reduces the overhead of control and management protocols used in the network. Switch chassis aggregation has many of the same benefits, but is supported more often as a dis-tribution or core switch feature, with switch stacking as a more typical access layer switch feature.\n",
            "All four sections of this chapter have a matching exam topic that uses the verb “describe,” \n",
